7,DAIO,DATA I/O CORP,2024-03-27,"  Risk Factors
 Cautionary Factors That May Affect Future Results Our disclosure and analysis in this Annual Report contains some forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements include our current expectations or forecasts of future events.  The reader can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.  In particular, these include statements relating to future action, supply chain expectations, semiconductor chip availability, Russia-Ukraine war impacts, prospective products, expected market growth, new technologies and trends, industry partnerships, foreign operations, economic expectations, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, outcome of contingencies, impact of regulatory requirements, tariffs and financial results. Any or all of the forward-looking statements in this Annual Report or in any other public statement made may turn out to be wrong.  They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make, or known or unknown risks and uncertainties can affect these forward-looking statements.  Many factors -- for example, product competition and product development -- will be important in determining future results.  Moreover, neither Data I/O nor anyone else assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of these forward-looking statements.  Actual future results may materially vary. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements after the date of this Annual Report, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  The reader should not unduly rely on our forward-looking statements.  The reader is advised, however, to consult any future disclosures we make on related subjects in our 10-Q, 8-K and 10-K reports to the SEC and press releases.  Also, note that we provide the following cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and possible inaccurate assumptions relevant to our business.  These are factors that we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results.  Other factors besides those listed here could also adversely affect us.  This discussion is permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  11Table of Contents RISK FACTORS: TARIFFS AND TRADE ISSUES Changes in tariffs and trade issues may adversely affect our business, including revenues and/or gross margins. We produce products in the United States and China.  Currently, certain of our products are subject to tariffs imposed by one country on goods manufactured in the other country.  This has materially impacted our gross margins negatively.  There is uncertainty regarding the tariffs expected to be imposed, and any increase in tariff rates and subjecting additional items to tariffs, could impact our costs, revenues and the competitiveness of our products due to our manufacturing locations.  Trade and tariff issues are creating business uncertainty and may spread to and impact other jurisdictions. Additionally, ongoing trade tensions between the United States and China are impacting our ability to seamlessly design, build, market and sell our products. These tensions may increase suddenly at any time due to government policies or actions. Some customers have moved production away from China, further from our facilities and engineers. We endeavor to have multi-sourced manufacturing, but this is not currently practical for all products in all locations.  War based restrictions, embargos, and supply chain disruptions have and are occurring as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which could have economic and other indirect impacts to our business.  We do not have any operations in Russia or Ukraine, nor do we rely on any software or hardware components sourced from these two countries. The Israel - Hamas war could have similar issues, although we have not experienced any material impacts. NEW PRODUCTS OR SERVICES We are pursuing new product or service initiatives, and business models that may develop more slowly and/or to a lesser extent than expected. In order to lead in new and potentially lucrative market opportunities, for example in security deployment of programmable devices, circuit boards and electronic systems, we are making significant investments in people, technology and business development while the market is developing and uncertain.  Due to the length of time to market from design to production in security provisioning, if these markets develop more slowly than planned, or if our security deployment solutions are not widely accepted, then we may not achieve our expected return on investment in new technologies, which may significantly affect the results of our existing business. In the security deployment area, we have introduced a pay per use business model and service fees that may not be accepted by our customers who are accustomed to paying for capital equipment upfront, rather than paying per use charges. Failure to adapt to technology trends in our industry may impact our competitiveness and financial results. Product and service technology in our industry evolves rapidly, making timely product innovation essential to success in the marketplace.  Introducing products and services with improved technologies or features may render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable.  Technological advances and trends that may negatively impact our business include:   ·new device package types, densities, chip interfaces and technologies requiring hardware and software changes in order to be programmed by our products, particularly certain segments of the high-density flash memory markets where after placement programming is recommended by certain semiconductor manufacturers;  ·reduction in semiconductor process geometries for certain 3 Dimensional (3D), Multi Level Cell (MLC) and Triple Level Cell (TLC) NAND and eMMC FLASH memories impact the product data retention through Surface Mount Technology (SMT) reflow or X-ray inspection. Improper SMT process control can negatively impact the end customer’s ability to successfully program devices. This can cause them to change their programing methods away from pre-programming to post placement programming techniques, including ISP, ICT. Data I/O has, and continues to work with several semiconductor manufacturers to develop best practices to minimize the impact of reflow and potential concerns about X-ray induced data loss so that preprogramming remains a supported alternative;  ·changes in Flash technology speeds will eventually require us to change the architecture of our programming engines;  ·electronics equipment manufacturing practices, such as widespread use of in-circuit programming or downloading;  ·adoption of proprietary security and programming protocols and additional security capabilities and requirements;   12Table of Contents ·customer software platform preferences different from those on which our products operate;  ·customer adoption of newer unsupported semiconductor device technologies such as NVMe memory or device interface methods, particularly if these technologies are adopted by automotive electronics, IoT or wireless customers; and/or  ·more rigid industry standards, which would decrease the value-added element of our products and support services.  If we cannot develop products or services in a timely manner in response to industry changes, or if our products or services do not perform well, our business and financial condition may be adversely affected.  Also, our new products or services may contain defects or errors that give rise to product liability claims against us or cause our products to fail to gain market acceptance.  Our future success depends on our ability to successfully compete with other technology firms in attracting and retaining key technical personnel. Failure to adapt to increasing automotive electronics customer requirements and a rapidly changing global automotive electronics ecosystem may impact our competitiveness and result in a decline in sales or increased costs. Concentration in automotive electronics and our orders related to automotive electronics customers has been dominant in recent years at 63% in 2023, 61% in 2022 and 58% in 2021.  As we have been concentrated on automotive electronics customers, any decrease in demand from these customers may materially impact our results, as it will take some time to transition our product line to other markets.  Quality standards and business requirements by our automotive electronics customers, driven in turn by their automotive manufacturer customers, may demand processes and certifications at a higher level than we currently are structured to provide.  For example, although we currently meet the ISO 9001:2015 standard, new quality standards, and environmental standards may be demanded by our customers with even more rigorous requirements.  In addition, contractual provisions may expose us to greater potential liability and costs and we may be required to provide higher service levels than we currently provide.  If we cannot adapt to these industry requirements or manage these contractual provisions, our business may be adversely affected. We are also seeing a shift in the global automotive industry towards new entrants touting new methods, especially for all electric vehicles. These new entrants may not develop solutions through the traditional value chain. If Data I/O is not able to market and sell effectively to these new entrants, we risk losing market share in our largest market. Delays in development, introduction and shipment of new products or services may result in a decline in sales or increased costs. We develop new engineering and automated programming systems and services.  Significant technological, supplier, manufacturing or other problems may delay the development, introduction or production of these products or services. For example, we may encounter these problems:  ·technical problems in the development of a new programming and/or security deployment systems or the robotics for new automated handing systems;  ·inability to hire qualified personnel or turnover in existing personnel or inability to engage or retain key technology partners;  ·delays or failures to perform by us or third parties, including some smaller early stage or recently acquired companies, involved in our development projects;  ·dependence on large semiconductor companies for cooperation and support to securely provision their devices. These companies must enable us with specific technical information and support Data I/O as a qualified solution to their customers and channel partners;  ·delays or failure to develop and utilize Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) for our offerings or services, potentially falling behind competitors exploiting the use of AI;  ·development of new products or services that are not accepted by the market; and/or  ·delays in supply chain for parts needed for new products.  These problems may result in a delay or decline in sales or increased costs.  13Table of Contents We may pursue business acquisitions that could impair our financial position and profitability. We may pursue acquisitions of complementary technologies, product lines or businesses.  Acquisitions may include risks, such as: ·burdening management and our operating teams during the integration of the acquisition;  ·diverting management’s attention from other business concerns;  ·failing to successfully integrate, scale or monetize the acquired products or technologies;  ·lack of acceptance of the acquired products by our sales channels or customers;  ·entering markets where we have no or limited prior experience;  ·potential loss of key employees of the acquired company; and/or  ·additional burden of support for an acquired programmer architecture.  Future acquisitions may also impact our financial position.  For example, we may use significant cash or incur debt, which would weaken our balance sheet, or issue additional shares, potentially diluting existing shareholders.  We may also capitalize goodwill and intangible assets acquired, the amortization or impairment of which would reduce our profitability.  We cannot guarantee that future acquisitions will improve our business or operating results. If we are unable to protect our IP, we may not be able to compete effectively or operate profitably. We rely on patents, copyrights, trade secrets and trademarks to protect our IP, as well as product development and marketing skill to establish and protect our market position.  In particular, patents are a key part of our security deployment strategy, and if we are not able to successfully enforce these patents, we might lose our competitive advantage in the security deployment market.  We attempt to protect our rights in proprietary software products, including our user interface, product firmware, software module options and other software products by retaining the title to and copyright of the software and documentation, by including appropriate contractual restrictions on use and disclosure in our licenses, and by requiring our employees to execute non-disclosure agreements. Because of the rapidly changing technology in the semiconductor, electronic equipment and software industries, portions of our products might possibly infringe upon existing patents or copyrights, and we might be required to obtain licenses or discontinue the use of the infringing technology.  We believe that any exposure we may have regarding possible infringement claims is a reasonable business risk similar to that assumed by other companies in the electronic equipment and software industries.  However, any claim of infringement, with or without merit, could be costly and a diversion of management’s attention, and an adverse determination could adversely affect our reputation, preclude us from offering certain products, and subject us to substantial liability. We might face increased competition and might not be able to compete successfully with current and future competitors. Technological advances have reduced the barriers of entry into the market in which we compete.  We expect competition to increase from both established and emerging companies.  If we fail to compete successfully against current and future sources of competition, our profitability and financial performance will be adversely impacted. THIRD PARTY RELATIONSHIPS If we do not develop and enhance our relationships with semiconductor manufacturers, our business may be adversely affected. We work closely with most semiconductor manufacturers to ensure that our data programming and security deployment systems comply with their requirements.  In addition, many semiconductor manufacturers recommend our managed and secure programming systems for use by users of their programmable devices.  These working relationships enable us to keep our programming systems product lines up to date and provide end-users with broad and current programmable device support.  As technology changes occur that could limit the effectiveness of pre-placement programming, particularly for very small high-density NAND, eMMC and UFS devices, certain semiconductor manufacturers may not recommend or may not continue recommending our programming systems for these devices.  Our business may be adversely affected if our relationships with semiconductor manufacturers deteriorate or if semiconductor manufacturers are not willing to closely work with us on security deployment.  Consolidation within the semiconductor industry may also impact us.  As we develop more security deployment solutions, we will need to partner more closely with semiconductor manufacturers.  14Table of Contents Our reliance on a small number of suppliers may result in a shortage of key components, which may adversely affect our business, and our suppliers may experience financial difficulties which could impact their ability to service our needs. Certain parts or software used in our products are currently available from either a single supplier or from a limited number of suppliers.  Our small relative level of business means we frequently lack influence and significant purchasing power.  If we cannot develop alternative sources of these components, if sales of parts or software are discontinued by the supplier, if we experience deterioration in our relationship with these suppliers, or if these suppliers require financing which is not available, there may be delays or reductions in product introductions or shipments, which may materially adversely affect our operating results. Because we rely on a small number of suppliers for certain parts, we are subject to possible price increases by these suppliers.  As experienced in 2022, we have seen more part shortages and larger price increases than in recent years. While this has returned to a stable situation in 2023, our volumes typically are not high enough to maintain multiple suppliers. Also, we may be unable to accurately forecast our production schedule.  If we underestimate our production schedule, suppliers may be unable to meet our demand for components.  This delay in the supply of key components may have a materially adverse effect on our business.  For suppliers who discontinue parts, we may be required to make lifetime purchases covering future requirements.   Over estimation of demand or excessive minimum order quantities may lead to excess inventories that may become obsolete.  Part shortages, especially semiconductor parts as experienced in 2021 and 2022, impact availability, lead times, and pricing that may be disruptive to our production plans, lead times, margins and may result in lost sales. Some of our sockets, parts, subassemblies and boards are currently manufactured to our specifications by third-party foreign contract manufacturers and we are sourcing certain parts or options from foreign manufacturers, particularly in China.  For example, due to geopolitical considerations, we may not be able to obtain a sufficient quantity of these products if and when needed or the quality of these parts or options may not meet our standards, which may result in lost sales. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified third-party distributors and representatives, our business may be adversely affected. We have an internal sales force and also utilize third-party distributors and representatives.  Therefore, the financial stability of these distributors and representatives is important.  Their ability to operate, timely pay us, and to acquire any necessary financing may be affected by the current economic climate.  Highly skilled professional engineers use most of our products.  To be effective, third-party distributors and representatives must possess significant technical, security, marketing, customer relationships and sales resources and must devote their resources to sales efforts, customer education, training and support.  These required qualities limit the number of potential third-party distributors and representatives.  Our business will suffer if we cannot attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified third-party distributors and representatives to market our products. MARKET CONDITIONS A decline in economic and market conditions may result in delayed or decreased capital spending and delayed or defaulted payments from our customers. The coronavirus derivatives or similar items may affect economic and market conditions as surges and spreads. Global impacts of the Russian invasion of Ukraine continue to evolve with sanctions and trade issues.  Our business is highly impacted by capital spending plans and other economic cycles that affect the users and manufacturers of integrated circuits.  The industries are highly cyclical and are characterized by rapid technological change, short product life cycles and fluctuations in manufacturing capacity and pricing and gross margin pressures.  As we experienced in this and recent prior years, our operations may in the future reflect substantial fluctuations from period-to-period as a consequence of these industry patterns, general economic conditions affecting the timing of orders from major customers, and other factors affecting capital spending.  In a difficult economic climate, it may take us longer to receive payments from our customers and some of our customers’ business may fail, resulting in non-payment.  Our market growth forecasts and related business decisions may be wrong.  These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Our international operations may expose us to additional risks that may adversely affect our business. International sales represented approximately 90%, 93% and 90% of net sales in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.  We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of our net revenue.  International sales may fluctuate due to various factors, including: ·the impact of COVID-19, the coronavirus and variants of it, or other viruses;   15Table of Contents ·fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates because 90% of our sales are to international markets, volatile exchange rates may also impact our competitiveness and margins, especially where we have subsidiary operations;  ·economic uncertainty related to the European energy cost increases;  ·China economic challenges, as this is a major market for our products and a significant production location;  ·migration of manufacturing to low cost geographies;  ·unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;  ·tariffs and taxes;  ·bi-lateral and multi-lateral trade agreements;  ·difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;  ·longer average payment cycles and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable;  ·compliance with applicable export licensing requirements and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;  ·product safety and other certification requirements;  ·difficulties in integrating foreign and outsourced operations;  ·war, civil unrest, political and economic instability, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the Israel – Hamas war;  ·ability to protect our intellectual property in multiple patent jurisdictions; and/or  ·ability to move cash freely from subsidiaries.  Because we have customers located throughout the world, we have significant foreign receivables, although none are based in Russia or Ukraine.  We may experience difficulties in collecting these amounts as a result of payment practices of certain foreign customers, economic uncertainty and regulations in foreign countries, the availability and reliability of foreign credit information, and potential difficulties in enforcing collection terms.   The European Union and European Free Trade Association (“EU”) has established certain electronic emission and product safety requirements (“CE”).  As applicable, our products currently meet these requirements; however, failure to obtain either a CE certification or a waiver for any product may prevent us from marketing that product in Europe.  The EU also has directives concerning the Reduction of Hazardous Substances (“RoHS”) and we believe we are classified within the EU RoHS Directive category list as Industrial Monitoring and Control Equipment (category 9).  We believe all current products meet the RoHS directives.  Failure to meet applicable directives or qualifying exemptions may prevent us from marketing certain products in Europe or other territories with similar requirements.   We have subsidiaries in Germany and China and large balances of cash are in our foreign subsidiaries.  Our business and financial condition is sensitive to currency exchange rates and any restrictions imposed on their currencies including restrictions on repatriations of cash.  A repatriation of cash has, and could in the future, result in tax costs and corresponding deferred tax assets with related tax valuation allowances.  Currency exchange fluctuations in these countries may adversely affect our investment in our subsidiaries. OPERATIONS Quarterly fluctuations in our operating results may adversely affect our stock price. Our operating results tend to vary from quarter to quarter.  Our revenue in each quarter substantially depends upon orders received within that quarter.  Conversely, our expenditures are based on investment plans and estimates of future revenues.  We may, therefore, be unable to quickly reduce our spending if our revenues decline in a given quarter.  As a result, operating results for that quarter will suffer.  Our results of operations for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future periods. Other factors, which may cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate, include: ·increased competition;  ·timing of new product announcements and timing of development expenditures;   16Table of Contents ·product or service releases and pricing changes by us or our competitors;  ·market acceptance or delays in the introduction of new products or services;  ·production constraints, including part shortages impact on us and our supply chains;  ·quality issues;  ·labor or material constraints;  ·timing of significant orders;  ·timing of installation or customer acceptance requirements;  ·sales channel mix of direct vs. indirect distribution;  ·civil unrest, war or terrorism;  ·health issues such as the outbreak of the coronavirus or other viruses impacting workers, suppliers, customers, travel, or our facilities;  ·customers’ budgets;  ·changes in accounting rules, tax or other legislation;  ·adverse movements in exchange rates, interest rates, inflation or tax rates;  ·cyclical and seasonal nature of demand for our customers’ products;  ·general economic conditions in the countries where we sell products;  ·expenses and delays obtaining authorizations in setting up new operations or locations; and/or  ·facilities relocations.  Due to any of the foregoing factors, it is possible that in some future quarters, our operating results will be below the expectations of analysts and investors. We have a history of operating losses and may be unable to generate enough revenue to achieve and maintain profitability. We have incurred operating losses in four of the last ten years.  We operate in a cyclical industry.  We will continue to examine our level of operating expense based upon our projected revenues.  Any planned increases in operating expenses may result in losses in future periods if projected revenues are not achieved or the investment level required is too large.  As a result, we may need to generate greater revenues than we have recently in order to maintain profitability.  However, we cannot provide assurance that our revenues will continue to increase and our business strategies may not be successful, resulting in future losses. The loss of key employees may adversely affect our operations. We have employees located in the U.S., Germany and China.  We also utilize independent contractors for specialty work, primarily in research and development, and utilize temporary workers to adjust capacity to fluctuating demand.  Many of our employees are highly skilled, and our continued success will depend in part upon our ability to attract and retain employees who can be in great demand within the industry.  None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit, and we believe relations with our employees are favorable, though no assurance can be made that this will be the case in the future.  In China, our workers have benefits and similar arrangements provided under a “FSCO” labor agreement, and we could be adversely affected if we were unable to continue that arrangement. We may need to raise additional capital and our future access to capital is uncertain. Our past revenues have sometimes been, and our future revenues may again be, insufficient to support the expense of our operations and any expansion of our business.  We may therefore need additional equity or debt capital to finance our operations.  If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or to obtain funds through additional debt, lease or equity financing, we may have to reduce some or all of our development and sales and marketing efforts and limit the expansion of our business.    17Table of Contents We believe that we have sufficient cash or working capital available under our operating plan to fund our operations and capital requirements through at least the next one-year period.  In the event we require additional cash for U.S. operations or other needs, we may choose to repatriate some, or all, of the cash held in our foreign subsidiaries.  There may be tax, legal and other impediments to any repatriation actions.  Our working capital may be used to fund possible losses, business growth, project initiatives, share repurchases, and business development initiatives including acquisitions, which could reduce our liquidity and result in a requirement for additional cash before that time.  Any substantial inability to achieve our current business plan could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, liquidity, or results of operations and may require us to reduce expenditures and/or seek additional financing. Therefore, we may seek additional funding through public or private debt or equity financing or from other sources.  We have no commitments for additional financing, and given a potential future unfavorable economic climate and our financial results, we may experience difficulty in obtaining funding on favorable terms, if at all.  Any financing we obtain may contain covenants that restrict our freedom to operate our business or may require us to issue securities that have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our Common Stock and may dilute your ownership interest. Our stock price may be volatile and, as a result, our shareholders may lose some or all of their investment. The stock prices of technology companies tend to fluctuate significantly.  We believe factors such as announcements of new products or services by us or our competitors and quarterly variations in financial results and outlook may cause the market price of our Common Stock to fluctuate substantially.  In addition, overall volatility in the stock market, particularly in the technology company sector, is often unrelated to the operating performance of companies.  If these market fluctuations continue in the future, they may adversely affect the price of our Common Stock.  Additionally, securities of certain companies have recently experienced significant and extreme volatility in stock price due to short sellers of shares of common stock, known as a “short squeeze.”  These short squeezes have caused extreme volatility in both the stock prices of those companies and in the market, and have led to the price per share of those companies to trade at a significantly inflated rate that is disconnected from the underlying value of the company. Many investors who have purchased shares in those companies at an inflated rate face the risk of losing a significant portion of their original investment, as in many cases the price per share has declined steadily as interest in those stocks have abated. While we have no reason to believe our shares would be the target of a short squeeze, there can be no assurance that we won’t be in the future, and you may lose a significant portion or all of your investment if you purchase our shares at a rate that is significantly disconnected from our underlying value.  CYBERSECURITY RISKS Cybersecurity breaches or terrorism could result in liabilities or costs as well as damage to or loss of our data or customer access to our website and information systems.  The collection, storage, transmission, use and disclosure of user data and personal information, if accessed improperly, could give rise to liabilities or additional costs as a result of laws, governmental regulations and evolving views of personal privacy rights.  Cybersecurity attacks may increase as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and/or deterioration of the geopolitical environment.  Cybersecurity breaches or terrorism could result in the exposure or theft of private or confidential information as well as interrupt our business, including denying customer access to our website and information systems.  We transmit, and in some cases store, end-user data, including personal information.  In jurisdictions around the world, personal information is becoming increasingly subject to legislation and regulations intended to protect consumers’ privacy and security.  The interpretation of privacy and data protection laws and regulations regarding the collection, storage, transmission, use and disclosure of such information in some jurisdictions is unclear and evolving.  These laws may be interpreted and applied in conflicting ways from country to country and in a manner that is not consistent with our current data protection practices.  Complying with these varying international requirements could cause us to incur additional costs and change our business practices.  Because our services are accessible in many foreign jurisdictions, some of these jurisdictions may claim that we are required to comply with their laws, even where we have no local entity, employees or infrastructure.  We could be forced to incur significant expenses if we were required to modify our products, our services or our existing security and privacy procedures in order to comply with new or expanded regulations. REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS Failure to comply with increasing regulatory requirements may adversely affect our stock price and business. As a public company, we are subject to numerous governmental and stock exchange requirements, with which we believe we are in compliance.  Our failure to meet regulatory requirements and exchange listing standards may result in actions such as: the delisting of our stock, impacting our stock’s liquidity; SEC enforcement actions; and securities claims and litigation. Unfortunately, increased regulations pushed onto public companies may have a disproportionate impact to smaller public companies.  18Table of Contents The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have requirements that we may fail to meet or we may fall out of compliance with, such as the internal controls auditor attestation required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, with which we are not currently required to comply as we are a smaller reporting company.  We assume that we will continue to have the status of a smaller reporting company based on the aggregate market value of the voting and non-voting shares held as of June 30, 2023.  If we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  Moreover, effective internal controls, particularly those related to revenue recognition, are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent financial fraud.  If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our stock could drop significantly.   While we have policies and procedures in place designed to prevent corruption and bribery, because our business is significantly international, violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) could have a significant adverse effect on our business due to the disruption and distraction of an investigation, financial penalties and criminal penalties. Government regulations regarding the use of “conflict” minerals and potential climate and ESG requirements could adversely affect our prospects and results of operations. Regulatory requirements regarding disclosure of our use of “conflict” minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries could affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of certain products. Although we do not buy raw materials, manufacture, or produce any electronic equipment using conflict minerals directly, some components provided by our suppliers and contained in our products contain conflict minerals.  Our goal is for our products to be conflict free.  As a result, there may only be a limited pool of suppliers who provide conflict free metals, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices.  Single source suppliers may not respond, or respond negatively regarding conflict mineral sourcing, and we may be unable to find alternative sources to replace them.  Also, because our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all metals used in the products that we sell.  Further, if we are unable to comply with the new laws or regulations or if our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us.  We may need to incur additional costs and invest additional resources, including management’s time, in order to comply with the new regulations and anticipated additional reporting and disclosure obligations.  Climate focused regulations and related disclosures are a similar evolving regulatory area and we may be required to invest in systems, processes and personnel to address new requirements in the ESG area.  These will require significant costs, work and reputational risk for failing to meet requirements, with miniscule impact to the global environment. "

 Cautionary Factors That May Affect Future Results    Our disclosure and analysis in this Annual Report contains some forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include our current expectations or forecasts of future events. The reader can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. In particular, these include statements relating to future action, the impact of the coronavirus, supply chain expectations, semiconductor chip shortages, Russia-Ukraine war impacts, prospective products, expected market growth, new technologies and trends, industry partnerships, foreign operations, economic expectations, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, outcome of contingencies, impact of regulatory requirements, tariffs and financial results. Any or all of the forward-looking statements in this Annual Report or in any other public statement made may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make, or known or unknown risks and uncertainties can affect these forward-looking statements. Many factors -- for example, product competition and product development -- will be important in determining future results. Moreover, neither Data I/O nor anyone else assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of these forward-looking statements. Actual future results may materially vary. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements after the date of this Annual Report, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. The reader should not unduly rely on our forward-looking statements. The reader is advised, however, to consult any future disclosures we make on related subjects in our 10-Q, 8-K and 10-K reports to the SEC and press releases. Also, note that we provide the following cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and possible inaccurate assumptions relevant to our business. These are factors that we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. Other factors besides those listed here could also adversely affect us. This discussion is permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  11Table of Contents RISK FACTORS: CORONAVIRUS The coronavirus that causes the serious disease COVID-19 (“coronavirus”), has and may continue to adversely affect our business, including revenues, suppliers, employees and facilities. As a global company with approximately 93% of our 2022 sales in international markets, we have been and may continue to be, significantly impacted by the word wide coronavirus outbreak, which has affected all markets we serve. Twenty seven of our employees are based in Shanghai, China and we have a manufacturing facility there which manufactures some of our equipment and develops most of the adapters and algorithms for our equipment. Although our facilities in Shanghai, Redmond and Germany are currently operating, they could be closed for an extended period of time due to outbreaks of new variants of coronavirus. Additionally, we source other components from China and other countries that are used to manufacture our equipment in China and in our Redmond, Washington facility and these components may not be readily available. Many of our Redmond based employees and executives are working from home or under hybrid schedules and we limit visitors to our facilities. All of our facilities are subject to restrictions and closure by governmental entities. Travel restrictions have in some cases prevented and may continue to impact equipment installations, repairs and selling at customer sites. As the coronavirus continues as a pandemic, it has and may continue to impact our revenues, our ability to obtain key components and to manufacture our products, as well as sell, install and support our products around the world. The coronavirus has and continues to impact key tradeshows and travel plans for our employees. Because of the coronavirus, we have experienced limitations on visiting many of our customers and prospects. Many tradeshows, marketing activities and conferences have been canceled, postponed or made virtual. However, we are experiencing reduced limitations on visiting customers and resumption of in person events.  TARIFFS AND TRADE ISSUES Changes in tariffs and trade issues may adversely affect our business, including revenues and/or gross margins. We produce products in the United States and China. Currently, certain of our products are subject to tariffs imposed by one country on goods manufactured in the other country. This has materially impacted our gross margins negatively. There is uncertainty regarding the tariffs expected to be imposed, and any increase in tariff rates and subjecting additional items to tariffs, could impact our costs, revenues and the competitiveness of our products due to our manufacturing locations. Trade and tariff issues are creating business uncertainty and may spread to and impact other jurisdictions. Additionally, trade tensions between the United States and China are impacting our ability to seamlessly design, build, market and sell our products. Some customers have moved production away from China, further from our facilities and engineers. We endeavor to have multi-sourced manufacturing, but this is not currently practical for all products in all locations.  War based restrictions, embargos, and supply chain disruptions are occurring as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which could have economic and other indirect impacts to our business. We do not have any operations in Russia or Ukraine, nor do we rely on any software or hardware components sourced from these two countries. NEW PRODUCTS OR SERVICES We are pursuing new product or service initiatives, and business models that may develop more slowly and/or to a lesser extent than expected. In order to lead in new and potentially lucrative market opportunities, for example in security deployment of programmable devices, circuit boards and electronic systems, we are making significant investments in people, technology and business development while the market is developing and uncertain. Due to the length of time to market from design to production in security provisioning, if these markets develop more slowly than planned, or if our security deployment solutions are not widely accepted, then we may not achieve our expected return on investment in new technologies, which may significantly affect the results of our existing business. In the security deployment area, we have introduced a new pay per use business model and service fees that may not be accepted by our customers who are accustomed to paying for capital equipment upfront, rather than paying per use charges.  12Table of Contents Failure to adapt to technology trends in our industry may impact our competitiveness and financial results. Product and service technology in our industry evolves rapidly, making timely product innovation essential to success in the marketplace. Introducing products and services with improved technologies or features may render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable. Technological advances and trends that may negatively impact our business include:  ·new device package types, densities, chip interfaces and technologies requiring hardware and software changes in order to be programmed by our products, particularly certain segments of the high-density flash memory markets where after placement programming is recommended by certain semiconductor manufacturers;  ·reduction in semiconductor process geometries for certain 3 Dimensional (3D), Multi Level Cell (MLC) and Triple Level Cell (TLC) NAND and eMMC FLASH memories impact the product data retention through Surface Mount Technology (SMT) reflow or X-ray inspection. Improper SMT process control can negatively impact the end customer’s ability to successfully program devices. This can cause them to change their programing methods away from pre-programming to post placement programming techniques, including ISP, ICT. Data I/O has, and continues to work with several semiconductor manufacturers to develop best practices to minimize the impact of reflow and potential concerns about X-ray induced data loss;  ·changes in Flash technology speeds will eventually require us to change the architecture of our programming engines;  ·electronics equipment manufacturing practices, such as widespread use of in-circuit programming or downloading;  ·adoption of proprietary security and programming protocols and additional security capabilities and requirements;  ·customer software platform preferences different from those on which our products operate;  ·customer adoption of newer unsupported semiconductor device technologies such as NVMe memory or device interface methods, particularly if these technologies are adopted by automotive electronics, IoT or wireless customers; and/or  ·more rigid industry standards, which would decrease the value-added element of our products and support services.  If we cannot develop products or services in a timely manner in response to industry changes, or if our products or services do not perform well, our business and financial condition may be adversely affected. Also, our new products or services may contain defects or errors that give rise to product liability claims against us or cause our products to fail to gain market acceptance. Our future success depends on our ability to successfully compete with other technology firms in attracting and retaining key technical personnel. Failure to adapt to increasing automotive electronics customer requirements may impact our competitiveness and result in a decline in sales or increased costs. Concentration in automotive electronics and our orders related to automotive electronics customers has been dominant in recent years at 61% in 2022, 58% in 2021 and 53% in 2020. As we have been concentrated on automotive electronics customers, any decrease in demand from these customers may materially impact our results, as it will take some time to transition our product line to other markets. Quality standards and business requirements by our automotive electronics customers, driven in turn by their automotive manufacturer customers, may demand processes and certifications at a higher level than we currently are structured to provide. For example, although we currently meet the ISO 9001:2015 standard, new quality standards may be demanded by our customers with even more rigorous requirements. In addition, contractual provisions may expose us to greater potential liability and costs and we may be required to provide higher service levels than we currently provide. If we cannot adapt to these industry requirements or manage these contractual provisions, our business may be adversely affected. Delays in development, introduction and shipment of new products or services may result in a decline in sales or increased costs. We develop new engineering and automated programming systems and services. Significant technological, supplier, manufacturing or other problems may delay the development, introduction or production of these products or services. For example, we may encounter these problems:  ·technical problems in the development of a new programming and/or security deployment systems or the robotics for new automated handing systems;  ·inability to hire qualified personnel or turnover in existing personnel or inability to engage or retain key technology partners;  ·delays or failures to perform by us or third parties, including some smaller early stage or recently acquired companies, involved in our development projects;  ·dependence on large semiconductor companies for cooperation and support to securely provision their devices. These companies must enable us with specific technical information and support Data I/O as a qualified solution to their customers and channel partners;  ·development of new products or services that are not accepted by the market; and/or  ·experience delays in supply chain for parts needed for new products.   13Table of Contents These problems may result in a delay or decline in sales or increased costs. We may pursue business acquisitions that could impair our financial position and profitability. We may pursue acquisitions of complementary technologies, product lines or businesses. Future acquisitions may include risks, such as: ·burdening management and our operating teams during the integration of the acquisition;  ·diverting management’s attention from other business concerns;  ·failing to successfully integrate, scale or monetize the acquired products or technologies;  ·lack of acceptance of the acquired products by our sales channels or customers;  ·entering markets where we have no or limited prior experience;  ·potential loss of key employees of the acquired company; and/or  ·additional burden of support for an acquired programmer architecture.  Future acquisitions may also impact our financial position. For example, we may use significant cash or incur debt, which would weaken our balance sheet, or issue additional shares, potentially diluting existing shareholders. We may also capitalize goodwill and intangible assets acquired, the amortization or impairment of which would reduce our profitability. We cannot guarantee that future acquisitions will improve our business or operating results. If we are unable to protect our IP, we may not be able to compete effectively or operate profitably. We rely on patents, copyrights, trade secrets and trademarks to protect our IP, as well as product development and marketing skill to establish and protect our market position. In particular, patents are a key part of our security deployment strategy, and if we are not able to successfully enforce these patents, we might lose our competitive advantage in the security deployment market. We attempt to protect our rights in proprietary software products, including our user interface, product firmware, software module options and other software products by retaining the title to and copyright of the software and documentation, by including appropriate contractual restrictions on use and disclosure in our licenses, and by requiring our employees to execute non-disclosure agreements. Because of the rapidly changing technology in the semiconductor, electronic equipment and software industries, portions of our products might possibly infringe upon existing patents or copyrights, and we might be required to obtain licenses or discontinue the use of the infringing technology. We believe that any exposure we may have regarding possible infringement claims is a reasonable business risk similar to that assumed by other companies in the electronic equipment and software industries. However, any claim of infringement, with or without merit, could be costly and a diversion of management’s attention, and an adverse determination could adversely affect our reputation, preclude us from offering certain products, and subject us to substantial liability. We might face increased competition and might not be able to compete successfully with current and future competitors. Technological advances have reduced the barriers of entry into the market in which we compete. We expect competition to increase from both established and emerging companies. If we fail to compete successfully against current and future sources of competition, our profitability and financial performance will be adversely impacted. THIRD PARTY RELATIONSHIPS If we do not develop and enhance our relationships with semiconductor manufacturers, our business may be adversely affected. We work closely with most semiconductor manufacturers to ensure that our data programming and security deployment systems comply with their requirements. In addition, many semiconductor manufacturers recommend our managed and secure programming systems for use by users of their programmable devices. These working relationships enable us to keep our programming systems product lines up to date and provide end-users with broad and current programmable device support. As technology changes occur that could limit the effectiveness of pre-placement programming, particularly for very small high-density NAND, eMMC and UFS devices, certain semiconductor manufacturers may not recommend or may not continue recommending our programming systems for these devices. Our business may be adversely affected if our relationships with semiconductor manufacturers deteriorate or if semiconductor manufacturers are not willing to closely work with us on security deployment. Consolidation within the semiconductor industry may also impact us. As we develop more security deployment solutions, we will need to partner more closely with semiconductor manufacturers.  14Table of Contents Our reliance on a small number of suppliers may result in a shortage of key components, which may adversely affect our business, and our suppliers may experience financial difficulties which could impact their ability to service our needs. Certain parts or software used in our products are currently available from either a single supplier or from a limited number of suppliers. Our small relative level of business means we frequently lack influence and significant purchasing power. If we cannot develop alternative sources of these components, if sales of parts or software are discontinued by the supplier, if we experience deterioration in our relationship with these suppliers, or if these suppliers require financing which is not available, there may be delays or reductions in product introductions or shipments, which may materially adversely affect our operating results. Because we rely on a small number of suppliers for certain parts, we are subject to possible price increases by these suppliers. In 2022, we have seen more part shortages and larger price increases than in recent years. Also, we may be unable to accurately forecast our production schedule. If we underestimate our production schedule, suppliers may be unable to meet our demand for components. This delay in the supply of key components may have a materially adverse effect on our business. For suppliers who discontinue parts, we may be required to make lifetime purchases covering future requirements. Over estimation of demand or excessive minimum order quantities will lead to excess inventories that may become obsolete. Part shortages, especially semiconductor parts in 2021 and 2022, impact availability, lead times, and pricing that may be disruptive to our production plans, lead times, margins and may result in lost sales. Some of our sockets, parts, subassemblies and boards are currently manufactured to our specifications by third-party foreign contract manufacturers and we are sourcing certain parts or options from foreign manufacturers, particularly in China. For example, due to the coronavirus or other viruses impacting workers, suppliers or travel, we may not be able to obtain a sufficient quantity of these products if and when needed or the quality of these parts or options may not meet our standards, which may result in lost sales. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified third-party distributors and representatives, our business may be adversely affected. We have an internal sales force and also utilize third-party distributors and representatives. Therefore, the financial stability of these distributors and representatives is important. Their ability to operate, timely pay us, and to acquire any necessary financing may be affected by the current economic climate. Highly skilled professional engineers use most of our products. To be effective, third-party distributors and representatives must possess significant technical, security, marketing, customer relationships and sales resources and must devote their resources to sales efforts, customer education, training and support. These required qualities limit the number of potential third-party distributors and representatives. Our business will suffer if we cannot attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified third-party distributors and representatives to market our products. MARKET CONDITIONS A decline in economic and market conditions may result in delayed or decreased capital spending and delayed or defaulted payments from our customers. The coronavirus will continue to affect economic and market conditions as it continues to spread. Global impacts of the Russian invasion of Ukraine are uncertain at the present time. Our business is highly impacted by capital spending plans and other economic cycles that affect the users and manufacturers of integrated circuits. The industries are highly cyclical and are characterized by rapid technological change, short product life cycles and fluctuations in manufacturing capacity and pricing and gross margin pressures. As we experienced in this and recent prior years, our operations may in the future reflect substantial fluctuations from period-to-period as a consequence of these industry patterns, general economic conditions affecting the timing of orders from major customers, and other factors affecting capital spending. In a difficult economic climate, it may take us longer to receive payments from our customers and some of our customers’ business may fail, resulting in non-payment. Our market growth forecasts and related business decisions may be wrong. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.  15Table of Contents Our international operations may expose us to additional risks that may adversely affect our business. International sales represented approximately 93%, 90% and 93% of net sales in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of our net revenue. International sales may fluctuate due to various factors, including: ·the impact of COVID-19, the coronavirus and variants of it, or other viruses;  ·fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates because 93% of our sales are to international markets, volatile exchange rates may also impact our competitiveness and margins, especially where we have subsidiary operations;  ·economic uncertainty related to the European energy cost increases;  ·migration of manufacturing to low cost geographies;  ·unexpected changes in regulatory requirements;  ·tariffs and taxes;  ·bi-lateral and multi-lateral trade agreements;  ·difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;  ·longer average payment cycles and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable;  ·compliance with applicable export licensing requirements and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;  ·product safety and other certification requirements;  ·difficulties in integrating foreign and outsourced operations;  ·war, civil unrest, political and economic instability, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine;  ·ability to protect our intellectual property in multiple patent jurisdictions; and/or  ·ability to move cash freely from subsidiaries.  Because we have customers located throughout the world, we have significant foreign receivables, although none are based in Russia or Ukraine. We may experience difficulties in collecting these amounts as a result of payment practices of certain foreign customers, economic uncertainty and regulations in foreign countries, the availability and reliability of foreign credit information, and potential difficulties in enforcing collection terms.  The European Union and European Free Trade Association (“EU”) has established certain electronic emission and product safety requirements (“CE”). As applicable, our products currently meet these requirements; however, failure to obtain either a CE certification or a waiver for any product may prevent us from marketing that product in Europe. The EU also has directives concerning the Reduction of Hazardous Substances (“RoHS”) and we believe we are classified within the EU RoHS Directive category list as Industrial Monitoring and Control Equipment (category 9). We believe all current products meet the RoHS directives. Failure to meet applicable directives or qualifying exemptions may prevent us from marketing certain products in Europe or other territories with similar requirements.  We have subsidiaries in Germany and China and large balances of cash are in our foreign subsidiaries. Our business and financial condition is sensitive to currency exchange rates and any restrictions imposed on their currencies including restrictions on repatriations of cash. A repatriation of cash has, and could in the future, result in tax costs and corresponding deferred tax assets with related tax valuation allowances. Currency exchange fluctuations in these countries may adversely affect our investment in our subsidiaries. OPERATIONS Quarterly fluctuations in our operating results may adversely affect our stock price. Our operating results tend to vary from quarter to quarter. Our revenue in each quarter substantially depends upon orders received within that quarter. Conversely, our expenditures are based on investment plans and estimates of future revenues. We may, therefore, be unable to quickly reduce our spending if our revenues decline in a given quarter. As a result, operating results for that quarter will suffer. Our results of operations for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future periods.  16Table of Contents Other factors, which may cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate, include: ·increased competition;  ·timing of new product announcements and timing of development expenditures;  ·product or service releases and pricing changes by us or our competitors;  ·market acceptance or delays in the introduction of new products or services;  ·production constraints, including part shortages impact on us and our supply chains;  ·quality issues;  ·labor or material constraints;  ·timing of significant orders;  ·timing of installation or customer acceptance requirements;  ·sales channel mix of direct vs. indirect distribution;  ·civil unrest, war or terrorism;  ·health issues such as the outbreak of the coronavirus or other viruses impacting workers, suppliers, customers, travel, or our facilities;  ·customers’ budgets;  ·changes in accounting rules, tax or other legislation;  ·adverse movements in exchange rates, interest rates, inflation or tax rates;  ·cyclical and seasonal nature of demand for our customers’ products;  ·general economic conditions in the countries where we sell products;  ·expenses and delays obtaining authorizations in setting up new operations or locations; and/or  ·facilities relocations.  Due to any of the foregoing factors, it is possible that in some future quarters, our operating results will be below expectations of analysts and investors. We have a history of operating losses and may be unable to generate enough revenue to achieve and maintain profitability. We have incurred operating losses in five of the last ten years. We operate in a cyclical industry. We will continue to examine our level of operating expense based upon our projected revenues. Any planned increases in operating expenses may result in losses in future periods if projected revenues are not achieved or the investment level required is too large. As a result, we may need to generate greater revenues than we have recently in order to maintain profitability. However, we cannot provide assurance that our revenues will continue to increase and our business strategies may not be successful, resulting in future losses. The loss of key employees may adversely affect our operations. We have employees located in the U.S., Germany and China. We also utilize independent contractors for specialty work, primarily in research and development, and utilize temporary workers to adjust capacity to fluctuating demand. Many of our employees are highly skilled, and our continued success will depend in part upon our ability to attract and retain employees who can be in great demand within the industry. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit, and we believe relations with our employees are favorable, though no assurance can be made that this will be the case in the future. In China, our workers have benefits and similar arrangements provided under a “FSCO” labor agreement, and we could be adversely affected if we were unable to continue that arrangement.  17Table of Contents We may need to raise additional capital and our future access to capital is uncertain. Our past revenues have sometimes been, and our future revenues may again be, insufficient to support the expense of our operations and any expansion of our business. We may therefore need additional equity or debt capital to finance our operations. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or to obtain funds through additional debt, lease or equity financing, we may have to reduce some or all of our development and sales and marketing efforts and limit the expansion of our business.  We believe that we have sufficient cash or working capital available under our operating plan to fund our operations and capital requirements through at least the next one-year period. In the event we require additional cash for U.S. operations or other needs, we may choose to repatriate some, or all, of the cash held in our foreign subsidiaries. There may be tax, legal and other impediments to any repatriation actions. Our working capital may be used to fund possible losses, business growth, project initiatives, share repurchases, and business development initiatives including acquisitions, which could reduce our liquidity and result in a requirement for additional cash before that time. Any substantial inability to achieve our current business plan could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, liquidity, or results of operations and may require us to reduce expenditures and/or seek additional financing. Therefore, we may seek additional funding through public or private debt or equity financing or from other sources. We have no commitments for additional financing, and given a potential future unfavorable economic climate and our financial results, we may experience difficulty in obtaining funding on favorable terms, if at all. Any financing we obtain may contain covenants that restrict our freedom to operate our business or may require us to issue securities that have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our Common Stock and may dilute your ownership interest. Cybersecurity breaches or terrorism could result in liabilities or costs as well as damage to or loss of our data or customer access to our website and information systems. The collection, storage, transmission, use and disclosure of user data and personal information, if accessed improperly, could give rise to liabilities or additional costs as a result of laws, governmental regulations and evolving views of personal privacy rights.  Cybersecurity attacks may increase as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Cybersecurity breaches or terrorism could result in the exposure or theft of private or confidential information as well as interrupt our business, including denying customer access to our website and information systems. We transmit, and in some cases store, end-user data, including personal information. In jurisdictions around the world, personal information is becoming increasingly subject to legislation and regulations intended to protect consumers’ privacy and security. The interpretation of privacy and data protection laws and regulations regarding the collection, storage, transmission, use and disclosure of such information in some jurisdictions is unclear and evolving. These laws may be interpreted and applied in conflicting ways from country to country and in a manner that is not consistent with our current data protection practices. Complying with these varying international requirements could cause us to incur additional costs and change our business practices. Because our services are accessible in many foreign jurisdictions, some of these jurisdictions may claim that we are required to comply with their laws, even where we have no local entity, employees or infrastructure. We could be forced to incur significant expenses if we were required to modify our products, our services or our existing security and privacy procedures in order to comply with new or expanded regulations. Our stock price may be volatile and, as a result, our shareholders may lose some or all of their investment. The stock prices of technology companies tend to fluctuate significantly. We believe factors such as announcements of new products or services by us or our competitors and quarterly variations in financial results and outlook may cause the market price of our Common Stock to fluctuate substantially. In addition, overall volatility in the stock market, particularly in the technology company sector, is often unrelated to the operating performance of companies. If these market fluctuations continue in the future, they may adversely affect the price of our Common Stock. Additionally, securities of certain companies have recently experienced significant and extreme volatility in stock price due to short sellers of shares of common stock, known as a “short squeeze.” These short squeezes have caused extreme volatility in both the stock prices of those companies and in the market, and have led to the price per share of those companies to trade at a significantly inflated rate that is disconnected from the underlying value of the company. Many investors who have purchased shares in those companies at an inflated rate face the risk of losing a significant portion of their original investment, as in many cases the price per share has declined steadily as interest in those stocks have abated. While we have no reason to believe our shares would be the target of a short squeeze, there can be no assurance that we won’t be in the future, and you may lose a significant portion or all of your investment if you purchase our shares at a rate that is significantly disconnected from our underlying value.   18Table of Contents REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS Failure to comply with increasing regulatory requirements may adversely affect our stock price and business. As a public company, we are subject to numerous governmental and stock exchange requirements, with which we believe we are in compliance. Our failure to meet regulatory requirements and exchange listing standards may result in actions such as: the delisting of our stock, impacting our stock’s liquidity; SEC enforcement actions; and securities claims and litigation. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have requirements that we may fail to meet or we may fall out of compliance with, such as the internal controls auditor attestation required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, with which we are not currently required to comply as we are a smaller reporting company. We assume that we will continue to have the status of a smaller reporting company based on the aggregate market value of the voting and non-voting shares held as of June 30, 2022. If we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Moreover, effective internal controls, particularly those related to revenue recognition, are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent financial fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our stock could drop significantly.  While we have policies and procedures in place designed to prevent corruption and bribery, because our business is significantly international, violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) could have a significant adverse effect on our business due to the disruption and distraction of an investigation, financial penalties and criminal penalties. Government regulations regarding the use of ""conflict"" minerals and potential climate and ESG requirements could adversely affect our prospects and results of operations. Regulatory requirements regarding disclosure of our use of “conflict” minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries could affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of certain products. Although we do not buy raw materials, manufacture, or produce any electronic equipment using conflict minerals directly, some components provided by our suppliers and contained in our products contain conflict minerals. Our goal is for our products to be conflict free. As a result, there may only be a limited pool of suppliers who provide conflict free metals, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Single source suppliers may not respond, or respond negatively regarding conflict mineral sourcing, and we may be unable to find alternative sources to replace them. Also, because our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all metals used in the products that we sell. Further, if we are unable to comply with the new laws or regulations or if our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us. We may need to incur additional costs and invest additional resources, including management’s time, in order to comply with the new regulations and anticipated additional reporting and disclosure obligations.  Climate focused regulations and related disclosures are a similar evolving regulatory area and we may be required to invest in systems, processes and personnel to address new requirements in the ESG area. These could require significant costs, work and reputational risk for failing to meet requirements, "

The reader should not unduly rely on our forward-looking statements. The reader is advised, however, to consult any future disclosures we make on related subjects in our 10-Q, 8-K and 10-K reports to the SEC and press releases. Also, note that we provide the following cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and possible inaccurate assumptions relevant to our business. These are factors that we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. Other factors besides those listed here could also adversely affect us. This discussion is permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.  11Table of Contents RISK FACTORS: CORONAVIRUS The coronavirus that causes the serious disease COVID-19 (“coronavirus”), has and may continue to adversely affect our business, including revenues, suppliers, employees and facilities. As a global company with 90% of our 2021 sales in international markets, we have been and may continue to be, significantly impacted by the word wide coronavirus outbreak, which has affected all markets we serve. Thirty of our employees are based in Shanghai, China and we have a manufacturing facility there which manufactures some of our equipment and develops most of the adapters and algorithms for our equipment. Although our facilities in Shanghai, Redmond and Germany are currently operating, they could be closed for an extended period of time due to outbreaks of new variants of coronavirus. Additionally, we source other components from China and other countries that are used to manufacture our equipment in China and in our Redmond, Washington facility and these components may not be readily available. Many of our Redmond based employees and executives are working from home or hybrid schedules and we limit visitors to our facilities. All of our facilities are subject to restrictions and closure by governmental entities. Travel restrictions have in some cases prevented and may continue to impact equipment installations, repairs and selling at customer sites. As the coronavirus continues as a pandemic, it has and may continue to impact our revenues, our ability to obtain key components and to manufacture our products, as well as sell, install and support our products around the world. The coronavirus has and continues to impact key tradeshows and travel plans for our employees. Because of the coronavirus, we are not able to visit many of our customers and prospects. Many tradeshows, marketing activities and conferences have been canceled, postponed or made virtual.  TARIFFS AND TRADE ISSUES Changes in tariffs and trade issues may adversely affect our business, including revenues and/or gross margins. We produce products in the United States and China. Currently, certain of our products are subject to tariffs imposed by one country on goods manufactured in the other country. This has materially impacted our gross margins negatively. There is uncertainty regarding the tariffs expected to be imposed, and any increase in tariff rates and subjecting additional items to tariffs, could impact our costs, revenues and the competitiveness of our products due to our manufacturing locations. Trade and tariff issues are creating business uncertainty and may spread to and impact other jurisdictions. Additionally, trade tensions between the United States and China are impacting our ability to seamlessly design, build, market and sell our products. Some customers have moved production away from China, further from our facilities and engineers. We endeavor to have multi-sourced manufacturing, but this is not currently practical for all products in all locations.  War based restrictions, embargos, and supply chain disruptions are occurring as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which could have economic and other indirect impacts to our business. We do not have any operations in Russia or Ukraine, nor do we rely on any software or hardware components sourced from these two countries. NEW PRODUCTS OR SERVICES We are pursuing new product or service initiatives, and business models that may develop more slowly and/or to a lesser extent than expected In order to lead in new and potentially lucrative market opportunities, for example in security deployment of programmable devices, circuit boards and electronic systems, we are making significant investments in people, technology and business development while the market is developing and uncertain. Due to the length of time to market from design to production in security provisioning, if these markets develop more slowly than planned, or if our security deployment solutions are not widely accepted, then we may not achieve our expected return on investment in new technologies, which may significantly affect the results of our existing business. In the security deployment area, we have introduced a new pay per use business model and service fees that may not be accepted by our customers who are accustomed to paying for capital equipment upfront, rather than paying per use charges. Failure to adapt to technology trends in our industry may impact our competitiveness and financial results. Product and service technology in our industry evolves rapidly, making timely product innovation essential to success in the marketplace. Introducing products and services with improved technologies or features may render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable. Technological advances and trends that may negatively impact our business include:  ·new device package types, densities, chip interfaces and technologies requiring hardware and software changes in order to be programmed by our products, particularly certain segments of the high-density flash memory markets where after placement programming is recommended by certain semiconductor manufacturers;  12Table of Contents ·reduction in semiconductor process geometries for certain 3 Dimensional (3D), Multi Level Cell (MLC) and Triple Level Cell (TLC) NAND and eMMC FLASH memories impact the product data retention through Surface Mount Technology (SMT) reflow or X-ray inspection. Improper SMT process control can negatively impact the end customer’s ability to successfully program devices. This can cause them to change their programing methods away from pre-programming to post placement programming techniques, including ISP, ICT. Data I/O has, and continues to work with several semiconductor manufacturers to develop best practices to minimize the impact of reflow and potential concerns about X-ray induced data loss;  ·changes in Flash technology speeds will eventually require us to change the architecture of our programming engines;  ·electronics equipment manufacturing practices, such as widespread use of in-circuit programming or downloading;  ·adoption of proprietary security and programming protocols and additional security capabilities and requirements;  ·customer software platform preferences different from those on which our products operate;  ·customer adoption of newer unsupported semiconductor device technologies such as NVMe memory or device interface methods, particularly if these technologies are adopted by automotive electronics, IoT or wireless customers; and/or  ·more rigid industry standards, which would decrease the value-added element of our products and support services.  If we cannot develop products or services in a timely manner in response to industry changes, or if our products or services do not perform well, our business and financial condition may be adversely affected. Also, our new products or services may contain defects or errors that give rise to product liability claims against us or cause our products to fail to gain market acceptance. Our future success depends on our ability to successfully compete with other technology firms in attracting and retaining key technical personnel. Failure to adapt to increasing automotive electronics customer requirements may impact our competitiveness and result in a decline in sales or increased costs. Concentration in Automotive Electronics and our orders related to automotive electronics customers has been dominant in recent years at 58% in 2021, 53% in 2020 and 60% in 2019. As we have been concentrated on automotive electronics customers, any decrease in demand from these customers (for example, many had plant shut downs during the second quarter of 2020 or experienced semiconductor part shortages during 2021) may materially impact our results, as it will take some time to transition our product line to other markets. Quality standards and business requirements by our automotive electronics customers, driven in turn by their automotive manufacturer customers, may demand processes, and certifications at a higher level than we currently are structured to provide. For example, although we currently meet the ISO 9001:2015 standard, new quality standards may be demanded by our customers with even more rigorous requirements. In addition, contractual provisions may expose us to greater potential liability and costs and we may be required to provide higher service levels than we currently provide. If we cannot adapt to these industry requirements or manage these contractual provisions, our business may be adversely affected. Delays in development, introduction and shipment of new products or services may result in a decline in sales or increased costs. We develop new engineering and automated programming systems and services. Significant technological, supplier, manufacturing or other problems may delay the development, introduction or production of these products or services. For example, we may encounter these problems:  ·technical problems in the development of a new programming and/or security deployment systems or the robotics for new automated handing systems;  ·inability to hire qualified personnel or turnover in existing personnel or inability to engage or retain key technology partners;  ·delays or failures to perform by us or third parties, including some smaller early stage or recently acquired companies, involved in our development projects;  ·dependence on large semiconductor companies for cooperation and support to securely provision their devices. These companies must enable us with specific technical information, and support Data I/O as a qualified solution to their customers and channel partners;  ·development of new products or services that are not accepted by the market; and/or  ·experience delays in supply chain for parts needed for new products.   13Table of Contents These problems may result in a delay or decline in sales or increased costs. We may pursue business acquisitions that could impair our financial position and profitability. We may pursue acquisitions of complementary technologies, product lines or businesses. Future acquisitions may include risks, such as: ·burdening management and our operating teams during the integration of the acquisition;  ·diverting management’s attention from other business concerns;  ·failing to successfully integrate, scale or monetize the acquired products or technologies;  ·lack of acceptance of the acquired products by our sales channels or customers;  ·entering markets where we have no or limited prior experience;  ·potential loss of key employees of the acquired company; and/or  ·additional burden of support for an acquired programmer architecture.  Future acquisitions may also impact our financial position. For example, we may use significant cash or incur debt, which would weaken our balance sheet, or issue additional shares, potentially diluting existing shareholders. We may also capitalize goodwill and intangible assets acquired, the amortization or impairment of which would reduce our profitability. We cannot guarantee that future acquisitions will improve our business or operating results. If we are unable to protect our IP, we may not be able to compete effectively or operate profitably. We rely on patents, copyrights, trade secrets and trademarks to protect our IP, as well as product development and marketing skill to establish and protect our market position. In particular, patents are a key part of our security deployment strategy, and if we are not able to successfully enforce these patents, we might lose our competitive advantage in the security deployment market. We attempt to protect our rights in proprietary software products, including our user interface, product firmware, software module options and other software products by retaining the title to and copyright of the software and documentation, by including appropriate contractual restrictions on use and disclosure in our licenses, and by requiring our employees to execute non-disclosure agreements. Because of the rapidly changing technology in the semiconductor, electronic equipment and software industries, portions of our products might possibly infringe upon existing patents or copyrights, and we might be required to obtain licenses or discontinue the use of the infringing technology. We believe that any exposure we may have regarding possible infringement claims is a reasonable business risk similar to that assumed by other companies in the electronic equipment and software industries. However, any claim of infringement, with or without merit, could be costly and a diversion of management’s attention, and an adverse determination could adversely affect our reputation, preclude us from offering certain products, and subject us to substantial liability. We might face increased competition and might not be able to compete successfully with current and future competitors. Technological advances have reduced the barriers of entry into the market in which we compete. We expect competition to increase from both established and emerging companies. If we fail to compete successfully against current and future sources of competition, our profitability and financial performance will be adversely impacted. THIRD PARTY RELATIONSHIPS If we do not develop, enhance and retain our relationships with security partners, our business may be adversely affected and we may not be able to timely develop new and cost effective managed and secure programming solutions. We may be required to complement our skills and expertise with partners’ expertise. Some of these partners are operating with more limited capital and/or management expertise than established firms or recently acquired firms that may have different priorities. Other partners are very large companies where prioritizing work with us may be difficult in light of competing priorities. We may need to develop alternate suppliers, sales channels, and business strategies. In 2020 and 2021, we significantly reduced our dependence on third parties for our SentriX platform.   14Table of Contents If we do not develop and enhance our relationships with semiconductor manufacturers, our business may be adversely affected. We work closely with most semiconductor manufacturers to ensure that our data programming and security deployment systems comply with their requirements. In addition, many semiconductor manufacturers recommend our managed and secure programming systems for use by users of their programmable devices. These working relationships enable us to keep our programming systems product lines up to date and provide end-users with broad and current programmable device support. As technology changes occur that could limit the effectiveness of pre-placement programming, particularly for very small high-density NAND, e-MMC and UFS devices, certain semiconductor manufacturers may not recommend or may not continue recommending our programming systems for these devices. Our business may be adversely affected if our relationships with semiconductor manufacturers deteriorate or if semiconductor manufacturers are not willing to closely work with us on security deployment. Consolidation within the semiconductor industry may also impact us. As we develop more security deployment solutions, we will need to partner more closely with semiconductor manufacturers. Our reliance on a small number of suppliers may result in a shortage of key components, which may adversely affect our business, and our suppliers may experience financial difficulties which could impact their ability to service our needs. Certain parts or software used in our products are currently available from either a single supplier or from a limited number of suppliers. Our small relative level of business means we frequently lack influence and significant purchasing power. If we cannot develop alternative sources of these components, if sales of parts or software are discontinued by the supplier, if we experience deterioration in our relationship with these suppliers, or if these suppliers require financing which is not available, there may be delays or reductions in product introductions or shipments, which may materially adversely affect our operating results. Because we rely on a small number of suppliers for certain parts, we are subject to possible price increases by these suppliers. In 2021, we have seen more part shortages and larger price increases than in recent years. Also, we may be unable to accurately forecast our production schedule. If we underestimate our production schedule, suppliers may be unable to meet our demand for components. This delay in the supply of key components may have a materially adverse effect on our business. For suppliers who discontinue parts, we may be required to make lifetime purchases covering future requirements. Over estimation of demand or excessive minimum order quantities will lead to excess inventories that may become obsolete. Part shortages, especially semiconductor parts in 2021, impact availability, lead times, and pricing that may be disruptive to our production plans, lead times, margins and may result in lost sales. Some of our sockets, parts, subassemblies and boards are currently manufactured to our specifications by third-party foreign contract manufacturers and we are sourcing certain parts or options from foreign manufacturers, particularly in China. For example, due to the coronavirus or other viruses impacting workers, suppliers or travel, we may not be able to obtain a sufficient quantity of these products if and when needed or the quality of these parts or options may not meet our standards, which may result in lost sales. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified third-party distributors and representatives, our business may be adversely affected. We have an internal sales force and also utilize third-party distributors and representatives. Therefore, the financial stability of these distributors and representatives is important. Their ability to operate, timely pay us, and to acquire any necessary financing may be affected by the current economic climate. Highly skilled professional engineers use most of our products. To be effective, third-party distributors and representatives must possess significant technical, security, marketing, customer relationships and sales resources and must devote their resources to sales efforts, customer education, training and support. These required qualities limit the number of potential third-party distributors and representatives. Our business will suffer if we cannot attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified third-party distributors and representatives to market our products. MARKET CONDITIONS A decline in economic and market conditions may result in delayed or decreased capital spending and delayed or defaulted payments from our customers. The coronavirus will continue to affect economic and market conditions as it continues to spread. Global impacts of the Russian invasion of Ukraine are uncertain at the present time. Our business is highly impacted by capital spending plans and other economic cycles that affect the users and manufacturers of integrated circuits. The industries are highly cyclical and are characterized by rapid technological change, short product life cycles and fluctuations in manufacturing capacity and pricing and gross margin pressures. As we experienced in this and recent prior years, our operations may in the future reflect substantial fluctuations from period-to-period as a consequence of these industry patterns, general economic conditions affecting the timing of orders from major customers, and other factors affecting capital spending. In a difficult economic climate, it may take us longer to receive payments from our customers and some of our customers’ business may fail, resulting in non-payment. Our market growth forecasts and related business decisions may be wrong. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.  15Table of Contents Our international operations may expose us to additional risks that may adversely affect our business. International sales represented approximately 90%, 93% and 92% of net sales in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of our net revenue. International sales may fluctuate due to various factors, including: ·the impact of the coronavirus or other viruses;  ·fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates because 90% of our sales are to international markets, volatile exchange rates may also impact our competitiveness and margins;  ·economic uncertainty related to the European energy cost increases;  ·migration of manufacturing to low cost geographies;  ·unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, including Brexit;  ·tariffs and taxes;  ·bi-lateral and multi-lateral trade agreements;  ·difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;  ·longer average payment cycles and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable;  ·compliance with applicable export licensing requirements and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;  ·product safety and other certification requirements;  ·difficulties in integrating foreign and outsourced operations; and/or  ·war, civil unrest, political and economic instability, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine.  Because we have customers located throughout the world, we have significant foreign receivables, although none are based in Russia or Ukraine. We may experience difficulties in collecting these amounts as a result of payment practices of certain foreign customers, economic uncertainty and regulations in foreign countries, the availability and reliability of foreign credit information, and potential difficulties in enforcing collection terms.  The European Union and European Free Trade Association (“EU”) has established certain electronic emission and product safety requirements (“CE”). As applicable, our products currently meet these requirements; however, failure to obtain either a CE certification or a waiver for any product may prevent us from marketing that product in Europe. The EU also has directives concerning the Reduction of Hazardous Substances (“RoHS”) and we believe we are classified within the EU RoHS Directive category list as Industrial Monitoring and Control Equipment (category 9). We believe all current products meet the RoHS directives. Failure to meet applicable directives or qualifying exemptions may prevent us from marketing certain products in Europe or other territories with similar requirements.  We have subsidiaries in Germany and China and large balances of cash are in our foreign subsidiaries. Our business and financial condition is sensitive to currency exchange rates and any restrictions imposed on their currencies including restrictions on repatriations of cash. A repatriation of cash has, and could in the future, result in tax costs and corresponding deferred tax assets with related tax valuation allowances. Currency exchange fluctuations in these countries may adversely affect our investment in our subsidiaries. OPERATIONS Quarterly fluctuations in our operating results may adversely affect our stock price. Our operating results tend to vary from quarter to quarter. Our revenue in each quarter substantially depends upon orders received within that quarter. Conversely, our expenditures are based on investment plans and estimates of future revenues. We may, therefore, be unable to quickly reduce our spending if our revenues decline in a given quarter. As a result, operating results for that quarter will suffer. Our results of operations for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future periods.  16Table of Contents Other factors, which may cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate, include: ·increased competition;·timing of new product announcements and timing of development expenditures;·product or service releases and pricing changes by us or our competitors;·market acceptance or delays in the introduction of new products or services;·production constraints, including part shortages impact on us and our supply chains;·quality issues;·labor or material constraints;·timing of significant orders;·timing of installation or customer acceptance requirements;·sales channel mix of direct vs. indirect distribution;·civil unrest, war or terrorism;·health issues such as the outbreak of the coronavirus or other viruses impacting workers, suppliers, customers, travel, or our facilities;·customers’ budgets;·changes in accounting rules, tax or other legislation;·adverse movements in exchange rates, interest rates or tax rates;·cyclical and seasonal nature of demand for our customers’ products;·general economic conditions in the countries where we sell products;·expenses and delays obtaining authorizations in setting up new operations or locations; and/or·facilities relocations.  Due to any of the foregoing factors, it is possible that in some future quarters, our operating results will be below expectations of analysts and investors. We have a history of operating losses and may be unable to generate enough revenue to achieve and maintain profitability. We have incurred operating losses in five of the last ten years. We operate in a cyclical industry. We will continue to examine our level of operating expense based upon our projected revenues. Any planned increases in operating expenses may result in losses in future periods if projected revenues are not achieved or the investment level required is too large. As a result, we may need to generate greater revenues than we have recently in order to maintain profitability. However, we cannot provide assurance that our revenues will continue to increase and our business strategies may not be successful, resulting in future losses. The loss of key employees may adversely affect our operations. We have employees located in the U.S., Germany and China. We also utilize independent contractors for specialty work, primarily in research and development, and utilize temporary workers to adjust capacity to fluctuating demand. Many of our employees are highly skilled, and our continued success will depend in part upon our ability to attract and retain employees who can be in great demand within the industry. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit, and we believe relations with our employees are favorable, though no assurance can be made that this will be the case in the future. In China, our workers have benefits and similar arrangements provided under a “FSCO” labor agreement, and we could be adversely affected if we were unable to continue that arrangement. We may need to raise additional capital and our future access to capital is uncertain. Our past revenues have sometimes been, and our future revenues may again be, insufficient to support the expense of our operations and any expansion of our business. We may therefore need additional equity or debt capital to finance our operations. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or to obtain funds through additional debt, lease or equity financing, we may have to reduce some or all of our development and sales and marketing efforts and limit the expansion of our business.   17Table of Contents We believe that we have sufficient cash or working capital available under our operating plan to fund our operations and capital requirements through at least the next one-year period. In the event we require additional cash for U.S. operations or other needs, we may choose to repatriate some, or all, of the cash held in our foreign subsidiaries. There may be tax, legal and other impediments to any repatriation actions. Our working capital may be used to fund possible losses, business growth, project initiatives, share repurchases, and business development initiatives including acquisitions, which could reduce our liquidity and result in a requirement for additional cash before that time. Any substantial inability to achieve our current business plan could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, liquidity, or results of operations and may require us to reduce expenditures and/or seek additional financing. Therefore, we may seek additional funding through public or private debt or equity financing or from other sources. We have no commitments for additional financing, and given a potential future unfavorable economic climate and our financial results, we may experience difficulty in obtaining funding on favorable terms, if at all. Any financing we obtain may contain covenants that restrict our freedom to operate our business or may require us to issue securities that have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our Common Stock and may dilute your ownership interest. Cybersecurity breaches or terrorism could result in liabilities or costs as well as damage to or loss of our data or customer access to our website and information systems. The collection, storage, transmission, use and disclosure of user data and personal information, if accessed improperly, could give rise to liabilities or additional costs as a result of laws, governmental regulations and evolving views of personal privacy rights.  Cybersecurity attacks may increase as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Cybersecurity breaches or terrorism could result in the exposure or theft of private or confidential information as well as interrupt our business, including denying customer access to our website and information systems. We transmit, and in some cases store, end-user data, including personal information. In jurisdictions around the world, personal information is becoming increasingly subject to legislation and regulations intended to protect consumers’ privacy and security. The interpretation of privacy and data protection laws and regulations regarding the collection, storage, transmission, use and disclosure of such information in some jurisdictions is unclear and evolving. These laws may be interpreted and applied in conflicting ways from country to country and in a manner that is not consistent with our current data protection practices. Complying with these varying international requirements could cause us to incur additional costs and change our business practices. Because our services are accessible in many foreign jurisdictions, some of these jurisdictions may claim that we are required to comply with their laws, even where we have no local entity, employees or infrastructure. We could be forced to incur significant expenses if we were required to modify our products, our services or our existing security and privacy procedures in order to comply with new or expanded regulations. Our stock price may be volatile and, as a result, our shareholders may lose some or all of their investment. The stock prices of technology companies tend to fluctuate significantly. We believe factors such as announcements of new products or services by us or our competitors and quarterly variations in financial results and outlook may cause the market price of our Common Stock to fluctuate substantially. In addition, overall volatility in the stock market, particularly in the technology company sector, is often unrelated to the operating performance of companies. If these market fluctuations continue in the future, they may adversely affect the price of our Common Stock. Additionally, securities of certain companies have recently experienced significant and extreme volatility in stock price due to short sellers of shares of common stock, known as a “short squeeze.” These short squeezes have caused extreme volatility in both the stock prices of those companies and in the market, and have led to the price per share of those companies to trade at a significantly inflated rate that is disconnected from the underlying value of the company. Many investors who have purchased shares in those companies at an inflated rate face the risk of losing a significant portion of their original investment, as in many cases the price per share has declined steadily as interest in those stocks have abated. While we have no reason to believe our shares would be the target of a short squeeze, there can be no assurance that we won’t be in the future, and you may lose a significant portion or all of your investment if you purchase our shares at a rate that is significantly disconnected from our underlying value.   18Table of Contents REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS Failure to comply with increasing regulatory requirements may adversely affect our stock price and business. As a public company, we are subject to numerous governmental and stock exchange requirements, with which we believe we are in compliance. Our failure to meet regulatory requirements and exchange listing standards may result in actions such as: the delisting of our stock, impacting our stock’s liquidity; SEC enforcement actions; and securities claims and litigation. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have requirements that we may fail to meet or we may fall out of compliance with, such as the internal controls auditor attestation required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, with which we are not currently required to comply as we are a smaller reporting company. We assume that we will continue to have the status of a smaller reporting company based on the aggregate market value of the voting and non-voting shares held as of June 30, 2021. If we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Moreover, effective internal controls, particularly those related to revenue recognition, are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent financial fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our stock could drop significantly.  While we have policies and procedures in place designed to prevent corruption and bribery, because our business is significantly international, violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) could have a significant adverse effect on our business due to the disruption and distraction of an investigation, financial penalties and criminal penalties. Government regulations regarding the use of “conflict” minerals could adversely affect our prospects and results of operations. Regulatory requirements regarding disclosure of our use of “conflict” minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries could affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of certain products. Although we do not buy raw materials, manufacture, or produce any electronic equipment using conflict minerals directly, some components provided by our suppliers and contained in our products contain conflict minerals. Our goal is for our products to be conflict free. As a result, there may only be a limited pool of suppliers who provide conflict free metals, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Single source suppliers may not respond, or respond negatively regarding conflict mineral sourcing, and we may be unable to find alternative sources to replace them. Also, because our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all metals used in the products that we sell. Further, if we are unable to comply with the new laws or regulations or if our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us. We may need to incur additional costs and invest additional resources, including management’s time, in order to comply with the new regulations and anticipated additional reporting and disclosure obligations. "

theseforward-looking statements.  Many factors -- for example, product competitionand product development -- will be important in determining future results. Moreover, neither Data I/O nor anyone else assumes responsibility for theaccuracy and completeness of these forward-looking statements.  Actual futureresults may materially vary.We undertake no obligation topublicly update any forward-looking statements after the date of this AnnualReport, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. The reader should not unduly rely on our forward-looking statements.  Thereader is advised, however, to consult any future disclosures we make onrelated subjects in our 10-Q, 8-K and 10-K reports to the SEC and pressreleases.  Also, note that we provide the following cautionary discussion ofrisks, uncertainties and possible inaccurate assumptions relevant to ourbusiness.  These are factors that we think could cause our actual results todiffer materially from expected and historical results.  Other factors besidesthose listed here could also adversely affect us.  This discussion is permittedby the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.RISK FACTORS:TARIFFS AND TRADE ISSUESChanges intariffs and trade issues may adversely affect our business, including revenuesand/or gross margins. We produce productsin the United States and China.  Currently, certain of our products are subjectto tariffs imposed by one country on goods manufactured in the other country. We are aware of proposals to increase tariff rates and to subject additional items to tariffs, which could impact ourcosts, revenues and the competitiveness of our products due to ourmanufacturing locations.  Trade and tariff issues are creating business uncertaintyand may spread to and impact other jurisdictions.10   NEW PRODUCTS OR SERVICESWe are pursuingnew product or service initiatives, and business models that may develop moreslowly and/or to a lesser extent than expected In order to lead innew and potentially lucrative market opportunities, for example in securityprovisioning of programmable devices, circuit boards and electronic systems, wemust invest ahead of others while the market is developing and uncertain.  Becauseof the lengthy time to market from design to production insecurityprovisioning, if these markets develop more slowly than planned, then we maynot achieve our expected return on investment in new technologies and this may affectthe results of our existing business. In the securityprovisioning area, we have introduced a new pay per use business model that maynot be accepted by our customers who are accustomed to paying for capitalequipment upfront, rather than paying per use charges. Failure to adapt to technology trendsin our industry may impact our competitiveness and financial results.Product and service technology in ourindustry evolves rapidly, making timely product innovation essential to successin the marketplace.  Introducing products and services with improvedtechnologies or features may render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable. Technological advances and trends that may negatively impact our businessinclude:  ·        new device package types,densities, chip interfaces and technologies requiring hardware and softwarechanges in order to be programmed by our products, particularly certainsegments of the high density flash memory markets where after placementprogramming is recommended by the semiconductor manufacturers·        reduction in semiconductor processgeometries for certain 3 Dimensional (3D), Multi Level Cell (MLC) and TripleLevel Cell (TLC) NAND and eMMC FLASH memories impact the product data retentionthrough Surface Mount Technology (SMT) reflow or X-ray inspection.  ImproperSMT process control can negatively impact the end customer’s ability tosuccessfully program devices prior to placement in manufacturing.  Thiscan cause them to change their programing methods away from pre-programming topost placement programming techniques, including ISP.  Data I/O is working withsemiconductor manufacturers to develop best practices to minimize the impact ofreflow and potential concerns about X-ray induced data loss.·        electronics equipmentmanufacturing practices, such as widespread use of in-circuit programming ordownloading·        adoption of proprietary securityand programming protocols and additional security capabilities and requirements·        customer software platformpreferences different from those on which our products operate·        customer adoption of newersemiconductor device technologies such as UFS memory or device interface methodssuch as PCI, particularly if these technologies are adopted by automotiveelectronics, IoT or wireless customers·        more rigid industry standards,which would decrease the value-added element of our products and supportservicesIf we cannot develop products orservices in a timely manner in response to industry changes, or if our productsor services do not perform well, our business and financial condition may beadversely affected.  Also, our new products or services may contain defects orerrors that give rise to product liability claims against us or cause ourproducts to fail to gain market acceptance.  Our future success depends on ourability to successfully compete with other technology firms in attracting andretaining key technical personnel.Failure to adapt to increasingautomotive electronics customer requirementsConcentration in Automotive Electronicsand our orders related to automotive electronics customers increased to 60% in2018, from 54% in 2017, and 47% in 2016.  As we become more concentrated onautomotive electronics customers, any decrease in demand from these customersmay materially impact our results, as it will take some time to transition ourproduct line to other markets.  Quality standards and business requirements byour automotive electronics customers, driven in turn by their automotivemanufacturer customers, may demand processes, and certifications at a higherlevel than we currently are structured to provide.  For example, although wecurrently meet the ISO 9001:2015 standard, new quality standards may be demanded by our customers with even more rigorousrequirements.  In addition, contractual provisions may expose us to greaterpotential liability and costs and we may be required to provide higher servicelevels than we currently provide.  If we cannot adapt to these industryrequirements or manage these contractual provisions, our business may beadversely affected.11  Delays in development, introduction and shipment ofnew products or services may result in a decline in sales or increased costs.We develop new engineering and automated programmingsystems and services.  Significant technological, supplier, manufacturing orother problems may delay the development, introduction or production of theseproducts or services.For example, we may encounter these problems: ·        technical problems in thedevelopment of a new programming and/or provisioning systems platform or therobotics for new automated handing systems·        inability to hire qualifiedpersonnel or turnover in existing personnel or inability to engage or retainkey technology partners·        delays or failures to perform byus or third parties, including some smaller early stage or recently acquiredcompanies, involved in our development projects·        dependence on large semiconductorcompanies for cooperation and support to securely provision their devices.These companies must enable us with specific technical information, and supportData I/O as a qualified solution to their customers and channel partners.·        development of new products orservices that are not accepted by the marketThese problems may result in a delay or declinein sales or increased costs.We may pursue business acquisitionsthat could impair our financial position and profitability.We may pursueacquisitions of complementary technologies, product lines or businesses. Future acquisitions may include risks, such as: ·        burdening management and ouroperating teams during the integration of the acquisition·        diverting management’s attentionfrom other business concerns·        failing to successfully integrateor monetize the acquired products or technologies·        lack of acceptance of the acquiredproducts by our sales channels or customers·        entering markets where we have noor limited prior experience·        potential loss of key employees ofthe acquired company·        additional burden of support foran acquired programmer architectureFuture acquisitionsmay also impact our financial position.  For example, we may use significantcash or incur debt, which would weaken our balance sheet, or issue additionalshares, potentially diluting existing shareholders.  We may also capitalizegoodwill and intangible assets acquired, the amortization or impairment ofwhich would reduce our profitability.  We cannot guarantee that futureacquisitions will improve our business or operating results. If we are unableto protect our IP, we may not be able to compete effectively or operateprofitably. We rely on patents,copyrights, trade secrets and trademarks to protect our IP, as well as productdevelopment and marketing skill to establish and protect our market position.  Inparticular, patents are a key part of our security provisioning strategy.  Weattempt to protect our rights in proprietary software products, including ouruser interface, product firmware, software module options and other softwareproducts by retaining the title to and copyright of the software anddocumentation, by including appropriate contractual restrictions on use anddisclosure in our licenses, and by requiring our employees to executenon-disclosure agreements. Because of the rapidly changingtechnology in the semiconductor, electronic equipment and software industries,portions of our products might possibly infringe upon existing patents orcopyrights, and we may be required to obtain licenses or discontinue the use of the infringing technology.  We believe thatany exposure we may have regarding possible infringement claims is a reasonablebusiness risk similar to that assumed by other companies in the electronicequipment and software industries.  However, any claim of infringement, with orwithout merit, could be costly and a diversion of management’s attention, andan adverse determination could adversely affect our reputation, preclude usfrom offering certain products, and subject us to substantial liability.12  We may face increased competition andmay not be able to compete successfully with current and future competitors.Technological advances have reduced thebarriers of entry into the programming systems market.  We expect competitionto increase from both established and emerging companies.  If we fail tocompete successfully against current and future sources of competition, ourprofitability and financial performance will be adversely impacted.THIRD PARTY RELATIONSHIPSIf we do not develop, enhance andretain our relationships with security partners, our business may be adverselyaffected and we may not be able to timely develop new and cost effectivemanaged and secure programming solutions.As we enter new areas in managed andsecure programming, we need to complement our skills and expertise with partners’expertise in security.  Some of these partners are early stage companies thatare operating with more limited capital and/or management expertise thanestablished firms or recently acquired firms that may have different priorities. Other partners are very large companies where prioritizing work with us may bedifficult in light of competing priorities.  For some of our then earlier stagepartners, we have obtained unique product features and capabilities in exchangefor NRE payments, pre-paid royalties, marketing incentives and salescooperation. If these unique features and capabilities are no longer available,we will face more competition. If our partners are unable to develop anddeliver solutions that we need to integrate into our managed and secureprogramming solutions, our products might be delayed, we might have to locatealternate partners and suppliers or develop the technology ourselves, and wewould still be responsible for paying any related pre-paid royalties or NREpayments.If we do not develop and enhance ourrelationships with semiconductor manufacturers, our business may be adverselyaffected.We work closely with most semiconductormanufacturers to ensure that our data programming and security provisioning systemscomply with their requirements.  In addition, many semiconductor manufacturersrecommend our managed and secure programming systems for use by users of theirprogrammable devices.  These working relationships enable us to keep ourprogramming systems product lines up to date and provide end-users with broadand current programmable device support.  As technology changes occur thatcould limit the effectiveness of pre-placement programming, particularly forvery small high density NAND, e-MMC and UFS devices, certain semiconductormanufacturers may not recommend or may not continue recommending ourprogramming systems for these devices.  Our business may be adversely affectedif our relationships with semiconductor manufacturers deteriorate or ifsemiconductor manufacturers are not willing to closely work with us on securityprovisioning.  Consolidation within the semiconductor industry may also impactus.  As we develop more security solutions, we will need to partner more closelywith semiconductor manufacturers.Our reliance on a small number ofsuppliers may result in a shortage of key components, which may adverselyaffect our business, and our suppliers may experience financial difficulties whichcould impact their ability to service our needs.Certain parts or software used in ourproducts are currently available from either a single supplier or from alimited number of suppliers.  Our small relative level of business means wefrequently lack influence and significant purchasing power.  If we cannotdevelop alternative sources of these components, if sales of parts or softwareare discontinued by the supplier, if we experience deterioration in ourrelationship with these suppliers, or if these suppliers require financing,which is not available, there may be delays or reductions in productintroductions or shipments, which may materially adversely affect our operatingresults.Because we rely on a small number ofsuppliers for certain parts, we are subject to possible price increases bythese suppliers.  Also, we may be unable to accurately forecast our productionschedule.  If we underestimate our production schedule, suppliers may be unableto meet our demand for components.  This delay in the supply of key componentsmay have a materially adverse effect on our business.  For suppliers whodiscontinue parts, we may be required to make lifetime purchases coveringfuture requirements.  Over estimation of demand or excessive minimum orderquantities will lead to excess inventories that may become obsolete.Certain of our sockets, parts,subassemblies and boards are currently manufactured to our specifications bythird-party foreign contract manufacturers and we are sourcing certain parts oroptions from foreign manufacturers.  We may not be able to obtain a sufficient quantity of these products if and whenneeded or the quality of these parts or options may not meet our standards,which may result in lost sales.13  If we are unable to attract and retainqualified third-party distributors and representatives, our business may beadversely affected.We have an internal sales force and alsoutilize third-party distributors and representatives.  Therefore, the financialstability of these distributors and representatives is important.  Theirability to operate, timely pay us, and to acquire any necessary financing maybe affected by the current economic climate.  Highly skilled professionalengineers use most of our products.  To be effective, third-party distributorsand representatives must possess significant technical, marketing, customerrelationships and sales resources and must devote their resources to salesefforts, customer education, training and support.  These required qualitieslimit the number of potential third-party distributors and representatives. Our business will suffer if we cannot attract and retain a sufficient number ofqualified third-party distributors and representatives to market our products.MARKET CONDITIONSA decline in economicand market conditions may result in delayed or decreased capital spending anddelayed or defaulted payments from our customers.Our business is highly impacted bycapital spending plans and other economic cycles that affect the users andmanufacturers of integrated circuits.  These industries are highly cyclical andare characterized by rapid technological change, short product life cycles andfluctuations in manufacturing capacity and pricing and gross margin pressures. As we experienced in recent prior years, our operations may in the futurereflect substantial fluctuations from period-to-period as a consequence ofthese industry patterns, general economic conditions affecting the timing oforders from major customers, and other factors affecting capital spending.  Ina difficult economic climate it may take us longer to receive payments from ourcustomers and some of our customers’ business may fail, resulting innon-payment.  Our market growth forecasts and related business decisions may bewrong.  These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business andfinancial condition.Ourinternational operations may expose us to additional risks that may adverselyaffect our business.Internationalsales represented approximately 88%, 92% and 88% of net sales in 2018, 2017,and 2016, respectively.  We expect that international sales will continue to bea significant portion of our net revenue.  International sales may fluctuatedue to various factors, including:·        fluctuations in foreign currencyexchange rates because 88% of our sales are to international markets, volatileexchange rates may also impact our competiveness and margins·        economic uncertainty related tothe European sovereign debt situation·        migration of manufacturing to lowcost geographies·        unexpected changes in regulatoryrequirements, including Brexit·        tariffs and taxes·        Bi-lateral and Multi-lateral tradeagreements·        difficulties in staffing andmanaging foreign operations·        longer average payment cycles anddifficulty in collecting accounts receivable·        compliance with applicable exportlicensing requirements and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act·        product safety and othercertification requirements·        difficulties in integratingforeign and outsourced operations·        civil unrest, political andeconomic instability Because we have customers locatedthroughout the world, we have significant foreign receivables.  We mayexperience difficulties in collecting these amounts as a result of paymentpractices of certain foreign customers, economic uncertainty and regulations inforeign countries, the availability and reliability of foreign creditinformation, and potential difficulties in enforcing collection terms.  14  The EuropeanUnion and European Free Trade Association (“EU”) has established certain electronicemission and product safety requirements (“CE”).  As applicable, our productscurrently meet these requirements; however, failure to obtain either a CE certificationor a waiver for any product may prevent us from marketing that product in Europe. The EU also has directives concerning the Reduction of Hazardous Substances(“RoHS”) and we believe we are classified within the EU RoHS Directive categorylist as Industrial Monitoring and Control Equipment (category 9).   We believeall current products meet the RoHS directives.  Failure to meet applicabledirectives or qualifying exemptions may prevent us from marketing certainproducts in Europe or other territories with similar requirements.  We have subsidiaries in Germany, China,Brazil and Canada and large balances of cash are in our foreign subsidiaries. Our business and financial condition is sensitive to currency exchange ratesand any restrictions imposed on their currencies including restrictions onrepatriations of cash.  Any repatriationof cash could result in tax costs and corresponding deferred tax assets withrelated tax valuation allowances.  Currency exchange fluctuations in thesecountries may adversely affect our investment in our subsidiaries.OPERATIONSQuarterly fluctuations in ouroperating results may adversely affect our stock price.Our operating results tend to vary fromquarter to quarter.  Our revenue in each quarter substantially depends uponorders received within that quarter.  Conversely, our expenditures are based oninvestment plans and estimates of future revenues.  We may, therefore, beunable to quickly reduce our spending if our revenues decline in a givenquarter.  As a result, operating results for that quarter will suffer.  Ourresults of operations for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative ofresults for any future periods.Other factors, which may cause ourquarterly operating results to fluctuate, include:·        increased competition ·        timing of new productannouncements and timing of development expenditures·        product or service releases andpricing changes by us or our competitors·        market acceptance or delays in theintroduction of new products or services·        production constraints·        quality issues·        labor or material constraints·        timing of significant orders·        timing of installation or customeracceptance requirements·        sales channel mix of direct vs.indirect distribution·        civil unrest, war or terrorism·        health issues (such as theoutbreak of a virus impacting workers or travel)·        customers’ budgets·        changes in accounting rules, taxor other legislation·        adverse movements in exchange rates,interest rates or tax rates·        cyclical and seasonal nature ofdemand for our customers’ products·        general economic conditions in thecountries where we sell products·        expenses and delays obtainingauthorizations in setting up new operations or locations·        facilities relocationsDue to any of the foregoing factors, itis possible that in some future quarters, our operating results will be belowexpectations of analysts and investors.15  We have ahistory of operating losses and may be unable to generate enough revenue toachieve and maintain profitability.We have incurred operating losses in threeof the last ten years.  We operate in a cyclical industry.  We will continue toexamine our level of operating expense based upon our projected revenues.  Anyplanned increases in operating expenses may result in losses in future periodsif projected revenues are not achieved.  As a result, we may need to generategreater revenues than we have recently in order to maintain profitability. However, we cannot provide assurance that our revenues will continue toincrease and our business strategies may not be successful, resulting in futurelosses.The loss of keyemployees may adversely affect our operations. We have employees located in the U.S.,Germany and China.  We also utilize independent contractors for specialty work,primarily in research and development, and utilize temporary workers to adjustcapacity to fluctuating demand.  Many of our employees are highly skilled andour continued success will depend in part upon our ability to attract andretain employees who can be in great demand within the industry.  None of ouremployees are represented by a collective bargaining unit and we believerelations with our employees are favorable, though no assurance can be madethat this will be the case in the future.  In China, our workers are “leased”with the arrangements made under the “FSCO” labor agreement and we could beadversely affected if we were unable to continue that arrangement.We may need toraise additional capital and our future access to capital is uncertain.Our past revenues have sometimes been,and our future revenues may again be, insufficient to support the expense ofour operations and any expansion of our business.  We may therefore needadditional equity or debt capital to finance our operations.  If we are unableto generate sufficient cash flows from operations or to obtain funds throughadditional debt, lease or equity financing, we may have to reduce some or allof our development and sales and marketing efforts and limit the expansion ofour business.  We believe that we have sufficient cashor working capital available under our operating plan to fund our operationsand capital requirements through at least the next one-year period.  In the event we require additional cash for U.S.operations or other needs, we may choose to repatriate some, or all, of the $6.4million held in our foreign subsidiaries. Although we have no current repatriation plans, there may be tax, legal andother impediments to any repatriation actions.  Our working capital may be usedto fund possible losses, business growth, project initiatives, sharerepurchases and business development initiatives including acquisitions, whichcould reduce our liquidity and result ina requirement for additional cash before that time.  Any substantial inability to achieve our currentbusiness plan could have a material adverse impact on our financial position,liquidity, or results of operations and may require us to reduce expendituresand/or seek additional financing.Therefore, we may seek additionalfunding through public or private debt or equity financing or from othersources.  We have no commitments for additional financing, and given apotential future unfavorable economic climate and our financial results, we mayexperience difficulty in obtaining funding on favorable terms, if at all.  Anyfinancing we obtain may contain covenants that restrict our freedom to operateour business or may require us to issue securities that have rights,preferences or privileges senior to our Common Stock and may dilute yourownership interest.Our stock price may be volatile and,as a result, our shareholders may lose some or all of their investment.The stock prices of technology companiestend to fluctuate significantly.  We believe factors such as announcements ofnew products or services by us or our competitors and quarterly variations infinancial results and outlook may cause the market price of our Common Stock tofluctuate substantially.  In addition, overall volatility in the stock market,particularly in the technology company sector, is often unrelated to theoperating performance of companies.  If these market fluctuations continue inthe future, they may adversely affect the price of our Common Stock.  Cyber security breaches or terrorismcould result in liabilities or costs as well as damage to or loss of our dataor customer access to our website and information systems.  The collection,storage, transmission, use and disclosure of user data and personalinformation, if accessed improperly, could give rise to liabilities oradditional costs as a result of laws, governmental regulations and evolvingviews of personal privacy rights.Cyber security breaches or terrorismcould result in the exposure or theft of private or confidential information aswell as interrupt our business, including denying customer access to ourwebsite and information systems.  We transmit, and in some cases store,end-user data, including personal information.  In jurisdictions around theworld, personal information is becoming increasingly subject to legislation andregulations intended to protect consumers’ privacy and security.  Theinterpretation of privacy and data protection laws and regulations regardingthe collection, storage, transmission, use and disclosure of such information in some jurisdictions is unclear andevolving.  These laws may be interpreted and applied in conflicting ways fromcountry to country and in a manner that is not consistent with our current dataprotection practices.  Complying with these varying international requirementscould cause us to incur additional costs and change our business practices. Because our services are accessible in many foreign jurisdictions, some ofthese jurisdictions may claim that we are required to comply with their laws,even where we have no local entity, employees or infrastructure.  We could beforced to incur significant expenses if we were required to modify ourproducts, our services or our existing security and privacy procedures in orderto comply with new or expanded regulations.16  REGULATORY REQUIREMENTSFailure tocomply with increasing regulatory requirements may adversely affect our stock priceand business.As a publiccompany, we are subject to numerous governmental and stock exchangerequirements, with which we believe we are in compliance.  Our failure to meetregulatory requirements and exchange listing standards may result in actions suchas: the delisting of our stock, impacting our stock’s liquidity; SECenforcement actions; and securities claims and litigation.The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and theSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have requirements that we may fail tomeet or we may fall out of compliance with, such as the internal controlsauditor attestation required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of2002, with which we are not currently required to comply as we are a smallerreporting company.  We assume that we will continue to have the status of asmaller reporting company based on the aggregate market value of the voting andnon-voting shares held as of June 30, 2018.  If we fail to achieve and maintainthe adequacy of our internal controls, as such standards are modified,supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that wecan conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls overfinancial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of2002.  Moreover, effective internal controls, particularly those related torevenue recognition, are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reportsand are important to help prevent financial fraud.  If we cannot providereliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating resultscould be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financialinformation, and the trading price of our stock could drop significantly.  While we have policies and procedures inplace designed to prevent corruption and bribery, because our business issignificantly international, violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act(FCPA) could have a significant adverse effect on our business due to thedisruption and distraction of an investigation, financial penalties andcriminal penalties.Government regulations regarding theuse of ""conflict"" minerals could adversely affect our prospectsand results of operations.Regulatory requirements regardingdisclosure of our use of “conflict” minerals mined from the Democratic Republicof Congo and adjoining countries could affect the sourcing and availability ofminerals used in the manufacture of certain products. Although we do not buyraw materials, manufacture, or produce any electronic equipment usingconflict minerals directly, some components provided by our suppliers andcontained in our products contain conflict minerals.  Our goal is for ourproducts to be conflict free.  As a result, there may only be a limited pool ofsuppliers who provide conflict free metals, and we cannot assure you that wewill be able to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitiveprices.  Single source suppliers may not respond or respond negativelyregarding conflict mineral sourcing and we may be unable to find alternativesources to replace them.  Also, because our supply chain is complex, we mayface reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if weare unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all metals used in the productsthat we sell.  Further, if we are unable to comply with the new laws orregulations or if our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations andstandards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodiesdue to ambiguities related to practice, regulatory authorities may initiatelegal proceedings against us.  We may need to incur additional costs and investadditional resources, including management’s time, in order to comply with thenew regulations and anticipated additional reporting and disclosure obligations"

 Cautionary Factors That May Affect Future Results Our disclosure and analysis in this Annual Report contains some forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements include our current expectations or forecasts of future events.  The reader can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.  In particular, these include statements relating to future action, prospective products, expected market growth, new technologies, industry partnerships, foreign operations, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, outcome of contingencies, impact of regulatory requirements and financial results.Any or all of the forward-looking statements in this Annual Report or in any other public statement made may turn out to be wrong.  They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make, or known or unknown risks and uncertainties can affect these forward-looking statements.  Many factors -- for example, product competition and product development -- will be important in determining future results.  Moreover, neither Data I/O nor anyone else assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of these forward-looking statements.  Actual future results may materially vary.We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements after the date of this Annual Report, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  The reader should not unduly rely on our forward-looking statements.  The reader is advised, however, to consult any future disclosures we make on related subjects in our 10-Q, 8-K and 10-K reports to the SEC and press releases.  Also, note that we provide the following cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and possible inaccurate assumptions relevant to our business.  These are factors that we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results.  Other factors besides those listed here could also adversely affect us.  This discussion is permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.10    RISK FACTORS:NEW PRODUCTS OR SERVICESWe may pursue new product or service initiatives that develop more slowly and/or to a lesser extent than expected In order to lead in new and potentially lucrative market opportunities, for example in security provisioning of programmable devices, circuit boards and electronic systems, we must invest ahead of others while the market is developing and uncertain.  If these markets develop more slowly than planned, then we may not achieve our expected return on investment in new technologies and this may affect the results of our existing business. We may pursue business acquisitions that could impair our financial position and profitability.We may pursue acquisitions of complementary technologies, product lines or businesses.  Future acquisitions may include risks, such as: ·       burdening management and our operating teams during the integration of the acquisition·       diverting management’s attention from other business concerns·       failing to successfully integrate or monetize the acquired products or technologies·       lack of acceptance of the acquired products by our sales channels or customers·       entering markets where we have no or limited prior experience·       potential loss of key employees of the acquired company·       additional burden of support for an acquired programmer architectureFuture acquisitions may also impact our financial position.  For example, we may use significant cash or incur debt, which would weaken our balance sheet, or issue additional shares, potentially diluting existing shareholders.  We may also capitalize goodwill and intangible assets acquired, the amortization or impairment of which would reduce our profitability.  We cannot guarantee that future acquisitions will improve our business or operating results. Delays in development, introduction and shipment of new products or services may result in a decline in sales or increased costs.We develop new engineering and automated programming systems and services.  Significant technological, supplier, manufacturing or other problems may delay the development, introduction or production of these products or services.For example, we may encounter these problems: ·       technical problems in the development of a new programming system platform or the robotics for new automated handing systems·       inability to hire qualified personnel or turnover in existing personnel·       delays or failures to perform by us or third parties, including some smaller early stage companies, involved in our development projects·       dependence on large semiconductor companies for cooperation and support to securely provisoin their devices. These companies must enable us with specific technical information, and support Data I/O as a qualified solution to their customers and channel partners.·       development of new products or services that are not accepted by the market11    These problems may result in a delay or decline in sales or increased costs.Failure to adapt to technology trends in our industry may impact our competitiveness and financial results.Product and service technology in our industry evolves rapidly, making timely product innovation essential to success in the marketplace.  Introducing products and services with improved technologies or features may render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable.  Technological advances and trends that may negatively impact our business include:  ·       new device package types, densities, chip interfaces and technologies requiring hardware and software changes in order to be programmed by our products, particularly certain segments of the high density flash memory markets where after placement programming is recommended by the semiconductor manufacturers·       reduction in semiconductor process geometries for certain Multi Level Cell (MLC) and Triple Level Cell (TLC) NAND and eMMC FLASH memories impact the product data retention through Surface Mount Technology (SMT) reflow or X-ray inspection.  Improper SMT process control can negatively impact the end customer’s ability to successfully program devices prior to placement in manufacturing.  This can cause them to change their programing methods away from pre-programming to post placement programming techniques, including ISP.  Data I/O is working with semiconductor manufacturers to develop best practices to minimize the impact of reflow and potential concerns about X-ray induced data loss.·       electronics equipment manufacturing practices, such as widespread use of in-circuit programming or downloading·       adoption of proprietary security and programming protocols and additional security capabilities and requirements·       customer software platform preferences different from those on which our products operate·       customer adoption of newer semiconductor device technologies such as UFS memory or device interface methods such as PCI, particularly if these technologies are adopted by automotive electronics, IoT or wireless customers·       more rigid industry standards, which would decrease the value-added element of our products and support servicesIf we cannot develop products or services in a timely manner in response to industry changes, or if our products or services do not perform well, our business and financial condition may be adversely affected.  Also, our new products or services may contain defects or errors that give rise to product liability claims against us or cause our products to fail to gain market acceptance.  Our future success depends on our ability to successfully compete with other technology firms in attracting and retaining key technical personnel.Failure to adapt to increasing automotive electronics customer requirementsQuality standards and business requirements by our automotive electronics customers, driven in turn by their automotive manufacturer customers, may demand processes, and certifications at a higher level than we currently are structured to provide.  For example, although we currently meet the ISO 9001:2015 standard, new quality standards may be demanded by our customers with even more rigorous requirements.  In addition, contractual provisions may expose us to greater potential liability and costs and we may be required to provide higher service levels than we currently provide.  If we cannot adapt to these industry requirements or manage these contractual provisions, our business may be adversely affected.If we are unable to protect our IP, we may not be able to compete effectively or operate profitably. We rely on patents, copyrights, trade secrets and trademarks to protect our IP, as well as product development and marketing skill to establish and protect our market position.  We attempt to protect our rights in proprietary software products, including our user interface, product firmware, software module options and other software products by retaining the title to and copyright of the software and documentation, by including appropriate contractual restrictions on use and disclosure in our licenses, and by requiring our employees to execute non-disclosure agreements. Because of the rapidly changing technology in the semiconductor, electronic equipment and software industries, portions of our products might possibly infringe upon existing patents or copyrights, and we may be required to obtain licenses or discontinue the use of the infringing technology.  We believe that any exposure we may have regarding possible infringement claims is a reasonable business risk similar to that assumed by other companies in the electronic equipment and software industries.  However, any claim of infringement, with or without merit, could be costly and a diversion of management’s attention, and an adverse determination could adversely affect our reputation, preclude us from offering certain products, and subject us to substantial liability.12    We may face increased competition and may not be able to compete successfully with current and future competitors.Technological advances have reduced the barriers of entry into the programming systems market.  We expect competition to increase from both established and emerging companies.  If we fail to compete successfully against current and future sources of competition, our profitability and financial performance will be adversely impacted.THIRD PARTY RELATIONSHIPSIf we do not develop and enhance our relationships with security partners, our business may be adversely affected and we may not be able to timely develop new and cost effective managed and secure programming solutions.As we enter new areas in managed and secure programming, we need to complement our skills and expertise with partners’ expertise in security.  Some of these partners are early stage companies that are operating with more limited capital and/or management expertise than established firms.  Other partners are very large companies where prioritizing work with us may be difficult in light of competing priorities.  For some of our earlier stage partners, we have demanded unique product features and capabilities in exchange for NRE payments, pre-paid royalties, marketing incentives and sales cooperation.  If our partners are unable to develop and deliver solutions that we need to integrate into our managed and secure programming solutions, our products might be delayed, we might have to locate alternate partners and suppliers or develop the technology ourselves, and we would still be responsible for paying any related pre-paid royalties or NRE payments.If we do not develop and enhance our relationships with semiconductor manufacturers, our business may be adversely affected.We work closely with most semiconductor manufacturers to ensure that our data programming and security provisioning systems comply with their requirements.  In addition, many semiconductor manufacturers recommend our managed and secure programming systems for use by users of their programmable devices.  These working relationships enable us to keep our programming systems product lines up to date and provide end-users with broad and current programmable device support.  As technology changes occur that could limit the effectiveness of pre-placement programming, particularly for very small high density NAND, e-MMC and UFS devices, certain semiconductor manufacturers may not recommend or may not continue recommending our programming systems for these devices.  Our business may be adversely affected if our relationships with semiconductor manufacturers deteriorate or if semiconductor manufacturers are not willing to closely work with us on security provisioning.  Consolidation within the semiconductor industry may also impact us.  As we develop more security solutions, we will need to partner more closely with semiconductor manufacturers.Our reliance on a small number of suppliers may result in a shortage of key components, which may adversely affect our business, and our suppliers may experience financial difficulties which could impact their ability to service our needs.Certain parts or software used in our products are currently available from either a single supplier or from a limited number of suppliers.  Our small relative level of business means we frequently lack influence and significant purchasing power.  If we cannot develop alternative sources of these components, if sales of parts or software are discontinued by the supplier, if we experience deterioration in our relationship with these suppliers, or if these suppliers require financing, which is not available, there may be delays or reductions in product introductions or shipments, which may materially adversely affect our operating results.Because we rely on a small number of suppliers for certain parts, we are subject to possible price increases by these suppliers.  Also, we may be unable to accurately forecast our production schedule.  If we underestimate our production schedule, suppliers may be unable to meet our demand for components.  This delay in the supply of key components may have a materially adverse effect on our business.  For suppliers who discontinue parts, we may be required to make lifetime purchases covering future requirements.  Over estimation of demand or excessive minimum order quantities will lead to excess inventories that may become obsolete.Certain of our sockets, parts, subassemblies and boards are currently manufactured to our specifications by third-party foreign contract manufacturers and we are sourcing certain parts or options from foreign manufacturers.  We may not be able to obtain a sufficient quantity of these products if and when needed or the quality of these parts or options may not meet our standards, which may result in lost sales.If we are unable to attract and retain qualified third-party distributors and representatives, our business may be adversely affected.We have an internal sales force and also utilize third-party distributors and representatives.  Therefore, the financial stability of these distributors and representatives is important.  Their ability to operate, timely pay us, and to acquire any necessary financing may be affected by the current economic climate.  Highly skilled professional engineers use most of our products.  To be effective, third-party distributors and representatives must possess significant technical, marketing, customer relationships and sales resources and must devote their resources to sales efforts, customer education, training and support.  These required qualities limit the number of potential third-party distributors and representatives.  Our business will suffer if we cannot attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified third-party distributors and representatives to market our products.13    MARKET CONDITIONSA decline in economic and market conditions may result in delayed or decreased capital spending and delayed or defaulted payments from our customers.Our business is highly impacted by capital spending plans and other economic cycles that affect the users and manufacturers of integrated circuits.  These industries are highly cyclical and are characterized by rapid technological change, short product life cycles and fluctuations in manufacturing capacity and pricing and gross margin pressures.  As we experienced in recent prior years, our operations may in the future reflect substantial fluctuations from period-to-period as a consequence of these industry patterns, general economic conditions affecting the timing of orders from major customers, and other factors affecting capital spending.  In a difficult economic climate it may take us longer to receive payments from our customers and some of our customers’ business may fail, resulting in non-payment.  Our market growth forecasts and related business decisions may be wrong.  These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.Our international operations may expose us to additional risks that may adversely affect our business.International sales represented approximately 92%, 88% and 90% of net sales in 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.  We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of our net revenue.  International sales may fluctuate due to various factors, including:·       fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates because 92% of our sales are to international markets, volatile exchange rates may also impact our competiveness and margins·       economic uncertainty related to the European sovereign debt situation·       migration of manufacturing to low cost geographies·       unexpected changes in regulatory requirements·       tariffs and taxes·       Bi-lateral and Multi-lateral trade agreements·       difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations·       longer average payment cycles and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable·       compliance with applicable export licensing requirements and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act·       product safety and other certification requirements·       difficulties in integrating foreign and outsourced operations·       civil unrest, political and economic instabilityBecause we have customers located throughout the world, we have significant foreign receivables.  We may experience difficulties in collecting these amounts as a result of payment practices of certain foreign customers, economic uncertainty and regulations in foreign countries, the availability and reliability of foreign credit information, and potential difficulties in enforcing collection terms.  The European Union and European Free Trade Association (“EU”) has established certain electronic emission and product safety requirements (“CE”).  As applicable, our products currently meet these requirements; however, failure to obtain either a CE certification or a waiver for any product may prevent us from marketing that product in Europe.  The EU also has directives concerning the Reduction of Hazardous Substances (“RoHS”) and we believe we are classified within the EU RoHS Directive category list as Industrial Monitoring and Control Equipment (category 9).   We believe all current products meet the RoHS directives.  Failure to meet applicable directives or qualifying exemptions may prevent us from marketing certain products in Europe or other territories with similar requirements.  14    We have subsidiaries in Germany, China, Hong Kong, Brazil and Canada and large balances of cash are in our foreign subsidiaries.  Our business and financial condition is sensitive to currency exchange rates and any restrictions imposed on their currencies including restrictions on repatriations of cash.  Any repatriation of cash could result in tax costs and corresponding deferred tax assets with related tax valuation allowances.  Tax reform and the effect of the “Deemed Repatriation” have been included in our 2017 financial statements.  Currency exchange fluctuations in these countries may adversely affect our investment in our subsidiaries.OPERATIONSQuarterly fluctuations in our operating results may adversely affect our stock price.Our operating results tend to vary from quarter to quarter.  Our revenue in each quarter substantially depends upon orders received within that quarter.  Conversely, our expenditures are based on investment plans and estimates of future revenues.  We may, therefore, be unable to quickly

nature of demand for our customers’ products·       general economic conditions in the countries where we sell products·       expenses and delays obtaining authorizations in setting up new operations or locations·       facilities relocationsDue to any of the foregoing factors, it is possible that in some future quarters, our operating results will be below expectations of analysts and investors.We have a history of operating losses and may be unable to generate enough revenue to achieve and maintain profitability.We have incurred operating losses in one of the last five years and three of the last ten years.  We operate in a cyclical industry.  We will continue to examine our level of operating expense based upon our projected revenues.  Any planned increases in operating expenses may result in losses in future periods if projected revenues are not achieved.  As a result, we may need to generate greater revenues than we have recently in order to maintain profitability.  However, we cannot provide assurance that our revenues will continue to increase and our business strategies may not be successful, resulting in future losses.15    The loss of key employees may adversely affect our operations. We have employees located in the U.S., Germany and China.  We also utilize independent contractors for specialty work, primarily in research and development, and utilize temporary workers to adjust capacity to fluctuating demand.  Many of our employees are highly skilled and our continued success will depend in part upon our ability to attract and retain employees who can be in great demand within the industry.  None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit and we believe relations with our employees are favorable, though no assurance can be made that this will be the case in the future.  In China, our workers are “leased” with the arrangements made under the “FSCO” labor agreement and we could be adversely affected if we were unable to continue that arrangement.We may need to raise additional capital and our future access to capital is uncertain.Our past revenues have sometimes been, and our future revenues may again be, insufficient to support the expense of our operations and any expansion of our business.  We may therefore need additional equity or debt capital to finance our operations.  If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or to obtain funds through additional debt, lease or equity financing, we may have to reduce some or all of our development and sales and marketing efforts and limit the expansion of our business.  We believe that we have sufficient cash or working capital available under our operating plan to fund our operations and capital requirements through at least the next one-year period.  In the event we require additional cash for U.S. operations or other needs, we may choose to repatriate some, or all, of the $6.2 million held in our foreign subsidiaries.  Although we have no current repatriation plans, there may be tax, legal and other impediments to any repatriation actions.  Our working capital may be used to fund possible losses, business growth, project initiatives, share repurchases and business development initiatives including acquisitions, which could reduce our liquidity and result in a requirement for additional cash before that time.  Any substantial inability to achieve our current business plan could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, liquidity, or results of operations and may require us to reduce expenditures and/or seek additional financing.Therefore, we may seek additional funding through public or private debt or equity financing or from other sources.  We have no commitments for additional financing, and given a potential future unfavorable economic climate and our financial results, we may experience difficulty in obtaining funding on favorable terms, if at all.  Any financing we obtain may contain covenants that restrict our freedom to operate our business or may require us to issue securities that have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our Common Stock and may dilute your ownership interest.Our stock price may be volatile and, as a result, our shareholders may lose some or all of their investment.The stock prices of technology companies tend to fluctuate significantly.  We believe factors such as announcements of new products or services by us or our competitors and quarterly variations in financial results and outlook may cause the market price of our Common Stock to fluctuate substantially.  In addition, overall volatility in the stock market, particularly in the technology company sector, is often unrelated to the operating performance of companies.  If these market fluctuations continue in the future, they may adversely affect the price of our Common Stock.  Cyber security breaches or terrorism could result in liabilities or costs as well as damage to or loss of our data or customer access to our website and information systems.  The collection, storage, transmission, use and disclosure of user data and personal information, if accessed improperly, could give rise to liabilities or additional costs as a result of laws, governmental regulations and evolving views of personal privacy rights. Cyber security breaches or terrorism could result in the exposure or theft of private or confidential information as well as interrupt our business, including denying customer access to our website and information systems.  We transmit, and in some cases store, end-user data, including personal information.  In jurisdictions around the world, personal information is becoming increasingly subject to legislation and regulations intended to protect consumers’ privacy and security.  The interpretation of privacy and data protection laws and regulations regarding the collection, storage, transmission, use and disclosure of such information in some jurisdictions is unclear and evolving.  These laws may be interpreted and applied in conflicting ways from country to country and in a manner that is not consistent with our current data protection practices.  Complying with these varying international requirements could cause us to incur additional costs and change our business practices.  Because our services are accessible in many foreign jurisdictions, some of these jurisdictions may claim that we are required to comply with their laws, even where we have no local entity, employees or infrastructure.  We could be forced to incur significant expenses if we were required to modify our products, our services or our existing security and privacy procedures in order to comply with new or expanded regulations.16    REGULATORY REQUIREMENTSFailure to comply with increasing regulatory requirements may adversely affect our stock price and business.As a public company, we are subject to numerous governmental and stock exchange requirements, with which we believe we are in compliance.  Our failure to meet regulatory requirements and exchange listing standards may result in actions such as: the delisting of our stock, impacting our stock’s liquidity; SEC enforcement actions; and securities claims and litigation.The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have requirements that we may fail to meet or we may fall out of compliance with, such as the internal controls auditor attestation required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, with which we are not currently required to comply as we are a smaller reporting company.  We assume that we will continue to have the status of a smaller reporting company based on the aggregate market value of the voting and non-voting shares held as of June 30, 2017.  If we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  Moreover, effective internal controls, particularly those related to revenue recognition, are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent financial fraud.  If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our stock could drop significantly.  While we have policies and procedures in place designed to prevent corruption and bribery, because our business is significantly international, violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) could have a significant adverse effect on our business due to the disruption and distraction of an investigation, financial penalties and criminal penalties.Government regulations regarding the use of ""conflict"" minerals could adversely affect our prospects and results of operations.Regulatory requirements regarding disclosure of our use of “conflict” minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries could affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of certain products. Although we do not buy raw materials, manufacture, or produce any electronic equipment using conflict minerals directly, some components provided by our suppliers and contained in our products contain conflict minerals.  Our goal is for our products to be conflict free.  As a result, there may only be a limited pool of suppliers who provide conflict free metals, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices.  Single source suppliers may not respond or respond negatively regarding conflict mineral sourcing and we may be unable to find alternative sources to replace them.  Also, because our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all metals used in the products that we sell.  Further, if we are unable to comply with the new laws or regulations or if our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us.  We may need to incur additional costs and invest additional resources, including management’s time, in order to comply with the new regulations and anticipated additional reporting and disclosure obligations"

 Cautionary Factors That May Affect Future Results Our disclosure and analysis in this Annual Report contains some forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements include our current expectations or forecasts of future events.  The reader can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.  In particular, these include statements relating to future action, prospective products, expected market growth, new technologies, foreign operations, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, outcome of contingencies, impact of regulatory requirements and financial results.Any or all of the forward-looking statements in this Annual Report or in any other public statement made may turn out to be wrong.  They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make, or known or unknown risks and uncertainties can affect these forward-looking statements.  Many factors -- for example, product competition and product development -- will be important in determining future results.  Moreover, neither Data I/O nor anyone else assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of these forward-looking statements.  Actual future results may materially vary.We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements after the date of this Annual Report, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  The reader should not unduly rely on our forward-looking statements.  The reader is advised, however, to consult any future disclosures we make on related subjects in our 10-Q, 8-K and 10-K reports to the SEC and press releases.  Also, note that we provide the following cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and possible inaccurate assumptions relevant to our business.  These are factors that we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results.  Other factors besides those listed here could also adversely affect us.  This discussion is permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.RISK FACTORS:NEW PRODUCTS OR SERVICESWe may pursue new product or service initiatives that develop more slowly and/or to a lesser extent than expected In order to lead in new and potentially lucrative market opportunities, for example in securing programmable devices, circuit boards and electronic systems, we must invest ahead of others while the market is developing and uncertain.  If these markets develop more slowly than planned, then we may not achieve our expected return on investment in new technologies and this may affect the results of our existing business. We may pursue business acquisitions that could impair our financial position and profitability.We may pursue acquisitions of complementary technologies, product lines or businesses.  Future acquisitions may include risks, such as: ·         burdening management and our operating teams during the integration of the acquisition·         diverting management’s attention from other business concerns10    ·         failing to successfully integrate or monetize the acquired products or technologies·         lack of acceptance of the acquired products by our sales channels or customers·         entering markets where we have no or limited prior experience·         potential loss of key employees of the acquired company·         additional burden of support for an acquired programmer architectureFuture acquisitions may also impact our financial position.  For example, we may use significant cash or incur debt, which would weaken our balance sheet, or issue additional shares, potentially diluting existing shareholders.  We may also capitalize goodwill and intangible assets acquired, the amortization or impairment of which would reduce our profitability.  We cannot guarantee that future acquisitions will improve our business or operating results. Delays in development, introduction and shipment of new products or services may result in a decline in sales or increased costs.We develop new engineering and automated programming systems and services.  Significant technological, supplier, manufacturing or other problems may delay the development, introduction or production of these products or services.For example, we may encounter these problems: ·         technical problems in the development of a new programming system platform or the robotics for new automated handing systems·         inability to hire qualified personnel or turnover in existing personnel·         delays or failures to perform by us or third parties involved in our development projects·         development of new products or services that are not accepted by the marketThese problems may result in a delay or decline in sales or increased costs.Failure to adapt to technology trends in our industry may impact our competitiveness and financial results.Product and service technology in our industry evolves rapidly, making timely product innovation essential to success in the marketplace.  Introducing products and services with improved technologies or features may render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable.  Technological advances and trends that may negatively impact our business include:  ·         new device package types, densities, chip interfaces and technologies requiring hardware and software changes in order to be programmed by our products, particularly certain segments of the high density flash memory markets where after placement programming is recommended by the semiconductor manufacturers·         reduction in semiconductor process geometries for certain Multi Level Cell (MLC) and Triple Level Cell (TLC) NAND and eMMC FLASH memories impact the product data retention through Surface Mount Technology (SMT) reflow or X-ray inspection.  Improper SMT process control can negatively impact the end customer’s ability to successfully program devices prior to placement in manufacturing.  This can cause them to change their programing methods away from pre-programming to post placement programming techniques, including ISP.  Data I/O is working with semiconductor manufacturers to develop best practices to minimize the impact of reflow and potential concerns about X-ray induced data loss.·         electronics equipment manufacturing practices, such as widespread use of in-circuit programming or downloading·         adoption of proprietary security and programming protocols and additional security capabilities and requirements·         customer software platform preferences different from those on which our products operate·         customer adoption of newer semiconductor device technologies such as UFS memory or device interface methods such as PCI, particularly if these technologies are adopted by automotive electronics, IoT or wireless customers·         more rigid industry standards, which would decrease the value-added element of our products and support services11    If we cannot develop products or services in a timely manner in response to industry changes, or if our products or services do not perform well, our business and financial condition may be adversely affected.  Also, our new products or services may contain defects or errors that give rise to product liability claims against us or cause our products to fail to gain market acceptance.  Our future success depends on our ability to successfully compete with other technology firms in attracting and retaining key technical personnel.Failure to adapt to increasing automotive electronics customer requirementsQuality standards and business requirements by our automotive electronics customers, driven in turn by their automotive manufacturer customers, may demand processes, and certifications at a higher level than we currently are structured to provide.  For example, we may be required to meet the ISO 9001 standard with certified audits or other quality standards.  In addition, contractual provisions may expose us to greater potential liability and costs and we may be required to provide higher service levels than we currently provide.  If we cannot adapt to these industry requirements or manage these contractual provisions, our business may be adversely affected.If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, we may not be able to compete effectively or operate profitably. We rely on patents, copyrights, trade secrets and trademarks to protect our intellectual property, as well as product development and marketing skill to establish and protect our market position.  We attempt to protect our rights in proprietary software products, including our user interface, product firmware, software module options and other software products by retaining the title to and copyright of the software and documentation, by including appropriate contractual restrictions on use and disclosure in our licenses, and by requiring our employees to execute non-disclosure agreements. Because of the rapidly changing technology in the semiconductor, electronic equipment and software industries, portions of our products might possibly infringe upon existing patents or copyrights, and we may be required to obtain licenses or discontinue the use of the infringing technology.  We believe that any exposure we may have regarding possible infringement claims is a reasonable business risk similar to that assumed by other companies in the electronic equipment and software industries.  However, any claim of infringement, with or without merit, could be costly and a diversion of management’s attention, and an adverse determination could adversely affect our reputation, preclude us from offering certain products, and subject us to substantial liability.We may face increased competition and may not be able to compete successfully with current and future competitors.Technological advances have reduced the barriers of entry into the programming systems market.  We expect competition to increase from both established and emerging companies.  If we fail to compete successfully against current and future sources of competition, our profitability and financial performance will be adversely impacted.THIRD PARTY RELATIONSHIPSIf we do not develop and enhance our relationships with security partners, our business may be adversely affected and we may not be able to timely develop new and cost effective managed and secure programming solutions.As we enter new areas in managed and secure programming, we need to complement our skills and expertise with partners’ expertise in security.  Some of these partners may be early stage companies that are operating with more limited capital and/or management expertise than established firms.  If our partners are unable to develop and deliver solutions that we need to integrate into our managed and secure programming solutions, our product might be delayed and we might have to locate alternate partners and suppliers or develop the technology ourselves.If we do not develop and enhance our relationships with semiconductor manufacturers, our business may be adversely affected.We work closely with most semiconductor manufacturers to ensure that our programming systems comply with their requirements.  In addition, many semiconductor manufacturers recommend our managed and secure programming systems for use by users of their programmable devices.  These working relationships enable us to keep our programming systems product lines up to date and provide end-users with broad and current programmable device support.  As technology changes occur that could limit the effectiveness of pre-placement programming, particularly for very small high density NAND, e-MMC and UFS devices, certain semiconductor manufacturers may not recommend or may not continue recommending our programming systems for these devices.  Our business may be adversely affected if our relationships with semiconductor manufacturers deteriorate.  Consolidation within the semiconductor industry may also impact us.  As we develop more security solutions, we will need to partner more deeply with semiconductor manufacturers.12    Our reliance on a small number of suppliers may result in a shortage of key components, which may adversely affect our business, and our suppliers may experience financial difficulties which could impact their ability to service our needs.Certain parts used in our products are currently available from either a single supplier or from a limited number of suppliers.  Our small relative level of business means we frequently lack influence and significant purchasing power.  If we cannot develop alternative sources of these components, if sales of parts are discontinued by the supplier, if we experience deterioration in our relationship with these suppliers, or if these suppliers require financing, which is not available, there may be delays or reductions in product introductions or shipments, which may materially adversely affect our operating results.Because we rely on a small number of suppliers for certain parts, we are subject to possible price increases by these suppliers.  Also, we may be unable to accurately forecast our production schedule.  If we underestimate our production schedule, suppliers may be unable to meet our demand for components.  This delay in the supply of key components may have a materially adverse effect on our business.  For suppliers who discontinue parts, we may be required to make lifetime purchases covering future requirements.  Over estimation of demand or excessive minimum order quantities will lead to excess inventories that may become obsolete.Certain of our sockets, parts, subassemblies and boards are currently manufactured to our specifications by third-party foreign contract manufacturers and we are sourcing certain parts or options from foreign manufacturers.  We may not be able to obtain a sufficient quantity of these products if and when needed or the quality of these parts or options may not meet our standards, which may result in lost sales.If we are unable to attract and retain qualified third-party distributors and representatives, our business may be adversely affected.We have an internal sales force and also utilize third-party distributors and representatives.  Therefore, the financial stability of these distributors and representatives is important.  Their ability to operate, timely pay us, and to acquire any necessary financing may be affected by the current economic climate.  Highly skilled professional engineers use most of our products.  To be effective, third-party distributors and representatives must possess significant technical, marketing, customer relationships and sales resources and must devote their resources to sales efforts, customer education, training and support.  These required qualities limit the number of potential third-party distributors and representatives.  Our business will suffer if we cannot attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified third-party distributors and representatives to market our products.MARKET CONDITIONSA decline in economic and market conditions may result in delayed or decreased capital spending and delayed or defaulted payments from our customers.Our business is highly impacted by capital spending plans and other economic cycles that affect the users and manufacturers of integrated circuits.  These industries are highly cyclical and are characterized by rapid technological change, short product life cycles and fluctuations in manufacturing capacity and pricing and gross margin pressures.  As we experienced in recent prior years, our operations may in the future reflect substantial fluctuations from period-to-period as a consequence of these industry patterns, general economic conditions affecting the timing of orders from major customers, and other factors affecting capital spending.  In a difficult economic climate it may take us longer to receive payments from our customers and some of our customers’ business may fail, resulting in non-payment.  Our market growth forecasts and related business decisions may be wrong.  These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.13    Our international operations may expose us to additional risks that may adversely affect our business.International sales represented approximately 88%, 90% and 90% of net sales in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.  We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of our net revenue.  International sales may fluctuate due to various factors, including:·        fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates because 88% of our sales are to international markets, volatile exchange rates may also impact our competiveness and margins·         economic uncertainty related to the European sovereign debt situation·         migration of manufacturing to low cost geographies·         unexpected changes in regulatory requirements·         tariffs and taxes·         Bi-lateral and Multi-lateral trade agreements·         difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations·         longer average payment cycles and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable·         compliance with applicable export licensing requirements and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act·         product safety and other certification requirements·         difficulties in integrating foreign and outsourced operations·         civil unrest, political and economic instabilityBecause we have customers located throughout the world, we have significant foreign receivables.  We may experience difficulties in collecting these amounts as a result of payment practices of certain foreign customers, economic uncertainty and regulations in foreign countries, the availability and reliability of foreign credit information, and potential difficulties in enforcing collection terms.  The European Union and European Free Trade Association (“EU”) has established certain electronic emission and product safety requirements (“CE”).  As applicable, our products currently meet these requirements; however, failure to obtain either a CE certification or a waiver for any product may prevent us from marketing that product in Europe.  The EU also has directives concerning the Reduction of Hazardous Substances (“RoHS”) and we believe we are classified within the EU RoHS Directive category list as Industrial Monitoring and Control Equipment (category 9), which is out of scope until the enforcement date of July 2017.  We believe all current products meet the RoHS directives.  Failure to meet applicable directives or qualifying exemptions may prevent us from marketing certain products in Europe or other territories with similar requirements.  We have subsidiaries in Germany, China, Hong Kong, Brazil and Canada and large balances of cash are in our foreign subsidiaries.  Our business and financial condition is sensitive to currency exchange rates and any restrictions imposed on their currencies including restrictions on repatriations of cash.  Any repatriation of cash could result in tax costs and corresponding deferred tax assets with related tax valuation allowances.  Currency exchange fluctuations in these countries may adversely affect our investment in our subsidiaries.OPERATIONSQuarterly fluctuations in our operating results may adversely affect our stock price.Our operating results tend to vary from quarter to quarter.  Our revenue in each quarter substantially depends upon orders received within that quarter.  Conversely, our expenditures are based on investment plans and estimates of future revenues.  We may, therefore, be unable to quickly reduce our spending if our revenues decline in a given quarter.  As a result, operating results for that quarter will suffer.  Our results of operations for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future periods.Other factors, which may cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate, include:14    ·         increased competition ·         timing of new product announcements and timing of development expenditures·         product or service releases and pricing changes by us or our competitors·         market acceptance or delays in the introduction of new products or services·         production constraints·         quality issues·         labor or material constraints·         timing of significant orders·         timing of installation or customer acceptance requirements·         sales channel mix of direct vs. indirect distribution·         civil unrest, war or terrorism·         health issues (such as the outbreak of a virus impacting workers or travel)·         customers’ budgets·         adverse movements in exchange rates, interest rates or tax rates·         cyclical and seasonal nature of demand for our customers’ products·         general economic conditions in the countries where we sell products·         expenses and delays obtaining authorizations in setting up new operations or locations·         facilities relocationsDue to any of the foregoing factors, it is possible that in some future quarters, our operating results will be below expectations of analysts and investors.We have a history of operating losses and may be unable to generate enough revenue to achieve and maintain profitability.We have incurred operating losses in two of the last five years and three of the last ten years.  We operate in a cyclical industry.  We will continue to examine our level of operating expense based upon our projected revenues.  Any planned increases in operating expenses may result in losses in future periods if projected revenues are not achieved.  As a result, we may need to generate greater revenues than we have recently in order to maintain profitability.  However, we cannot provide assurance that our revenues will continue to increase and our business strategies may not be successful, resulting in future losses.The loss of key employees may adversely affect our operations. We have employees located in the U.S., Germany and China.  We also utilize independent contractors for specialty work, primarily in research and development, and utilize temporary workers to adjust capacity to fluctuating demand.  Many of our employees are highly skilled and our continued success will depend in part upon our ability to attract and retain employees who can be in great demand within the industry.  None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit and we believe relations with our employees are favorable, though no assurance can be made that this will be the case in the future.  In China, our workers are “leased” with the arrangements made under the “FSCO” labor agreement and we could be adversely affected if we were unable to continue that arrangement.We may need to raise additional capital and our future access to capital is uncertain.Our past revenues have sometimes been, and our future revenues may again be, insufficient to support the expense of our operations and any expansion of our business.  We may therefore need additional equity or debt capital to finance our operations.  If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or to obtain funds through additional debt, lease or equity financing, we may have to reduce some or all of our development and sales and marketing efforts and limit the expansion of our business.  15    We believe that we have sufficient cash or working capital available under our operating plan to fund our operations and capital requirements through at least the next one-year period.  In the event we may require additional cash for U.S. operations or other needs, it may cause the potential repatriation of cash from the $5.6 million held in our foreign subsidiaries.  Although we have no current repatriation plans, there may be tax, legal and other impediments to any repatriation actions.  Our working capital may be used to fund possible losses, business growth, project initiatives, share repurchases and business development initiatives including acquisitions, which could reduce our liquidity and result in a requirement for additional cash before that time.  Any substantial inability to achieve our current business plan could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, liquidity, or results of operations and may require us to reduce expenditures and/or seek additional financing.Therefore, we may seek additional funding through public or private debt or equity financing or from other sources.  We have no commitments for additional financing, and given a potential future unfavorable economic climate and our financial results, we may experience difficulty in obtaining funding on favorable terms, if at all.  Any financing we obtain may contain covenants that restrict our freedom to operate our business or may require us to issue securities that have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our Common Stock and may dilute your ownership interest.Our stock price may be volatile and, as a result, you may lose some or all of your investment.The stock prices of technology companies tend to fluctuate significantly.  We believe factors such as announcements of new products or services by us or our competitors and quarterly variations in financial results and outlook may cause the market price of our Common Stock to fluctuate substantially.  In addition, overall volatility in the stock market, particularly in the technology company sector, is often unrelated to the operating performance of companies.  If these market fluctuations continue in the future, they may adversely affect the price of our Common Stock.  Cyber security breaches or terrorism could result in liabilities or costs as well as damage to or loss of our data or customer access to our website and information systems.  The collection, storage, transmission, use and disclosure of user data and personal information, if accessed improperly, could give rise to liabilities or additional costs as a result of laws, governmental regulations and evolving views of personal privacy rights. Cyber security breaches or terrorism could result in the exposure or theft of private or confidential information as well as interrupt our business, including denying customer access to our website and information systems.  We transmit, and in some cases store, end-user data, including personal information.  In jurisdictions around the world, personal information is becoming increasingly subject to legislation and regulations intended to protect consumers’ privacy and security.  The interpretation of privacy and data protection laws and regulations regarding the collection, storage, transmission, use and disclosure of such information in some jurisdictions is unclear and evolving.  These laws may be interpreted and applied in conflicting ways from country to country and in a manner that is not consistent with our current data protection practices.  Complying with these varying international requirements could cause us to incur additional costs and change our business practices.  Because our services are accessible in many foreign jurisdictions, some of these jurisdictions may claim that we are required to comply with their laws, even where we have no local entity, employees or infrastructure.  We could be forced to incur significant expenses if we were required to modify our products, our services or our existing security and privacy procedures in order to comply with new or expanded regulations.REGULATORY REQUIREMENTSFailure to comply with increasing regulatory requirements may adversely affect our stock price and business.As a public company, we are subject to numerous governmental and stock exchange requirements, with which we believe we are in compliance.  Our failure to meet regulatory requirements and exchange listing standards may result in actions such as: the delisting of our stock, impacting our stock’s liquidity; SEC enforcement actions; and securities claims and litigation.The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have requirements that we may fail to meet or we may fall out of compliance with, such as the internal controls auditor attestation required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, with which we are not currently required to comply as we are a smaller reporting company.  We assume that we will continue to have the status of a smaller reporting company based on the aggregate market value of the voting and non-voting shares held as of June 30, 2016.  If we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  Moreover, effective internal controls, particularly those related to revenue recognition, are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent financial fraud.  If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our stock could drop significantly.  16    While we have policies and procedures in place designed to prevent corruption and bribery, because our business is significantly international, violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) could have a significant adverse effect on our business due to the disruption and distraction of an investigation, financial penalties and criminal penalties.Government regulations regarding the use of ""conflict"" minerals could adversely affect our prospects and results of operations.Regulatory requirements regarding disclosure of our use of “conflict” minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries could affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of certain products.

historical results.  Other factors besides thoselisted here could also adversely affect us.  This discussion is permitted bythe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.RISK FACTORSDelays in development, introduction and shipment ofnew products or services may result in a decline in sales or increased costs.We develop new engineering and automated programmingsystems and services.  Significant technological, supplier, manufacturing orother problems may delay the development, introduction or production of theseproducts or services.For example, we may encounter these problems: 10  ·        technical problems in thedevelopment of a new programming system platform or the robotics for newautomated handing systems·        inability to hire qualifiedpersonnel or turnover in existing personnel·        delays or failures to perform byus or third parties involved in our development projects·        development of new products orservices that are not accepted by the marketThese problems may result in a delay or declinein sales or increased costs.Quarterly fluctuations in ouroperating results may adversely affect our stock price.Our operating results tend to vary fromquarter to quarter.  Our revenue in each quarter substantially depends uponorders received within that quarter.  Conversely, our expenditures are based oninvestment plans and estimates of future revenues.  We may, therefore, beunable to quickly reduce our spending if our revenues decline in a givenquarter.  As a result, operating results for that quarter will suffer.  Ourresults of operations for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative ofresults for any future periods.Other factors, which may cause ourquarterly operating results to fluctuate, include:·        increased competition ·        timing of new productannouncements and timing of development expenditures·        product or service releases andpricing changes by us or our competitors·        market acceptance or delays in theintroduction of new products or services·        production constraints·        quality issues·        labor or material·        timing of significant orders·        timing of installation or customeracceptance requirements·        sales channel mix of direct vs.indirect distribution·        civil unrest, war or terrorism·        health issues (such as theoutbreak of a virus impacting workers or travel)·        customers’ budgets·        adverse movements in exchangerates, interest rates or tax rates·        cyclical and seasonal nature ofdemand for our customers’ products·        general economic conditions in thecountries where we sell products·        expenses and obtainingauthorizations in setting up new operations or locations·        facilities relocationsDue to any of the foregoing factors, itis possible that in some future quarters, our operating results will be belowexpectations of analysts and investors.Ourinternational operations may expose us to additional risks that may adverselyaffect our business.Internationalsales represented approximately 90%, 90%, and 88% of our net sales for thefiscal years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively.  We expectthat international sales will continue to be a significant portion of our netrevenue.  International sales may fluctuate due to various factors, including:·        fluctuations in foreign currencyexchange rates; with a significant impact due to the 2015 strength of the U.S. Dollarand relative weakness of the Euro, as 39% of our 2015 sales were European-based and of those, a large portion of sales through our German subsidiary are denominated in Euros.  Because 90% of our sales are to international markets, volatile exchange rates may also impact our competiveness and margins11    ·         economic uncertainty related to the European sovereign debt situation·         migration of manufacturing to low cost geographies·         unexpected changes in regulatory requirements·         tariffs and taxes·         difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations·         longer average payment cycles and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable·         compliance with applicable export licensing requirements and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act·         product safety and other certification requirements·         difficulties in integrating foreign and outsourced operations·         civil unrest, political and economic instabilityBecause we have customers located throughout the world, we have significant foreign receivables.  We may experience difficulties in collecting these amounts as a result of payment practices of certain foreign customers, economic uncertainty and regulations in foreign countries, the availability and reliability of foreign credit information, and potential difficulties in enforcing collection terms.  The European Union and European Free Trade Association (“EU”) has established certain electronic emission and product safety requirements (“CE”).  As applicable, our products currently meet these requirements; however, failure to obtain either a CE certification or a waiver for any product may prevent us from marketing that product in Europe.  The EU also has directives concerning the Reduction of Hazardous Substances (“RoHS”) and we believe we are classified within the EU RoHS Directive category list as Industrial Monitoring and Control Equipment (category 9), which is out of scope until the enforcement date of July 2017.  Failure to meet applicable directives or qualifying exemptions may prevent us from marketing certain products in Europe or other territories with similar requirements.  We have subsidiaries in Germany, China, Hong Kong, Brazil and Canada and large balances of cash are in our foreign subsidiaries (with 31% in China).  Our business and financial condition is sensitive to currency exchange rates and any restrictions imposed on their currencies including restrictions on repatriations of cash.  Any repatriation of cash could result in tax costs and corresponding deferred tax assets with related tax valuation allowances.  Currency exchange fluctuations in these countries may adversely affect our investment in our subsidiaries.A decline in economic and market conditions may result in delayed or decreased capital spending and delayed or defaulted payments from our customers.Our business is highly impacted by capital spending plans and other economic cycles that affect the users and manufacturers of integrated circuits.  These industries are highly cyclical and are characterized by rapid technological change, short product life cycles and fluctuations in manufacturing capacity and pricing and gross margin pressures.  As we experienced in recent prior years, our operations may in the future reflect substantial fluctuations from period-to-period as a consequence of these industry patterns, general economic conditions affecting the timing of orders from major customers, and other factors affecting capital spending.  In a difficult economic climate it may take us longer to receive payments from our customers and some of our customers’ business may fail, resulting in non-payment.  Our market growth forecasts and related business decisions may be wrong.  These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.Failure to adapt to technology trends in our industry may impact our competitiveness and financial results.Product and service technology in our industry evolves rapidly, making timely product innovation essential to success in the marketplace.  Introducing products and services with improved technologies or features may render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable.  Technological advances and trends that may negatively impact our business include:  12    ·         new device package types, densities, chip interfaces and technologies requiring hardware and software changes in order to be programmed by our products, particularly certain segments of the high density flash memory markets where after placement programming is recommended by the semiconductor manufacturers·         reduction in semiconductor process geometries for certain Multi Level Cell (MLC) and Triple Level Cell (TLC) NAND and eMMC FLASH memories impact the product data retention through Surface Mount Technology (SMT) reflow or X-ray inspection.  Improper SMT process control can negatively impact the end customer’s ability to successfully program devices prior to placement in manufacturing.  This can cause them to change their programing methods away from pre-programming to post placement programming techniques, including ISP.  Data I/O is working with semiconductor manufacturers to develop best practices to minimize the impact of reflow and potential concerns about X-ray induced data loss.·         electronics equipment manufacturing practices, such as widespread use of in-circuit programming or downloading·         adoption of proprietary security and programming protocols and additional security capabilities and requirements·         customer software platform preferences different from those on which our products operate·         customer adoption of newer semiconductor device technologies such as UFS memory or device interface methods such as PCI, particularly if these technologies are adopted by automotive electronics, IoT or wireless customers·         more rigid industry standards, which would decrease the value-added element of our products and support servicesIf we cannot develop products or services in a timely manner in response to industry changes, or if our products or services do not perform well, our business and financial condition may be adversely affected.  Also, our new products or services may contain defects or errors that give rise to product liability claims against us or cause our products to fail to gain market acceptance.  Our future success depends on our ability to successfully compete with other technology firms in attracting and retaining key technical personnel.Failure to adapt to increasing automotive electronics customer requirementsQuality standards and business requirements by our automotive electronics customers, driven in turn by their automotive manufacturer customers, may demand processes, and certifications at a higher level than we currently are structured to provide.  For example, we may be required to meet the ISO 9001 standard with certified audits or other quality standards.  In addition, contractual provisions may expose us to greater potential liability and costs and we may be required to provide higher service levels than we currently provide.  If we cannot adapt to these industry requirements or manage these contractual provisions, our business may be adversely affected.We have a history of recent operating losses and may be unable to generate enough revenue to achieve and maintain profitability.We have incurred operating losses in two of the last five years and four of the last ten years.  We operate in a cyclical industry.  We will continue to examine our level of operating expense based upon our projected revenues.  Any planned increases in operating expenses may result in losses in future periods if projected revenues are not achieved.  As a result, we may need to generate greater revenues than we have recently in order to maintain profitability.  However, we cannot provide assurance that our revenues will continue to increase and our business strategies may not be successful, resulting in future losses.We may face increased competition and may not be able to compete successfully with current and future competitors.Technological advances have reduced the barriers of entry into the programming systems market.  We expect competition to increase from both established and emerging companies.  If we fail to compete successfully against current and future sources of competition, our profitability and financial performance will be adversely impacted.If our relationships with semiconductor manufacturers deteriorate, our business may be adversely affected.We work closely with most semiconductor manufacturers to ensure that our programming systems comply with their requirements.  In addition, many semiconductor manufacturers recommend our programming systems for use by users of their programmable devices.  Consolidation within the semiconductor industry may impact us.  These working relationships enable us to keep our programming systems product lines up to date and provide end-users with broad and current programmable device support.  As technology changes occur that limit the effectiveness of pre-placement programming, particularly for very small high density NAND, e-MMC andUFS devices, certain semiconductor manufacturers may not recommend or may notcontinue recommending our programming systems for these devices.  Our businessmay be adversely affected if our relationships with semiconductor manufacturersdeteriorate.13  Our reliance on a small number ofsuppliers may result in a shortage of key components, which may adverselyaffect our business, and our suppliers may experience financial difficultieswhich could impact their ability to service our needs.Certain parts used in our products arecurrently available from either a single supplier or from a limited number ofsuppliers.  If we cannot develop alternative sources of these components, ifsales of parts are discontinued by the supplier, if we experience deteriorationin our relationship with these suppliers, or if these suppliers requirefinancing, which is not available, there may be delays or reductions in productintroductions or shipments, which may materially adversely affect our operatingresults.Because we rely on a small number ofsuppliers for certain parts, we are subject to possible price increases bythese suppliers.  Also, we may be unable to accurately forecast our productionschedule.  If we underestimate our production schedule, suppliers may be unableto meet our demand for components.  This delay in the supply of key componentsmay have a materially adverse effect on our business.  For suppliers whodiscontinue parts, we may be required to make lifetime purchases coveringfuture requirements.  Over estimation of demand or excessive minimum orderquantities will lead to excess inventories that may become obsolete.Certain of our sockets, parts,subassemblies and boards are currently manufactured to our specifications bythird-party foreign contract manufacturers and we are sourcing certain parts oroptions from foreign manufacturers.  We may not be able to obtain a sufficientquantity of these products if and when needed or the quality of these parts oroptions may not meet our standards, which may result in lost sales.If we are unable to attract andretain qualified third-party distributors and representatives, our business maybe adversely affected.We have an internal sales force and alsoutilize third-party distributors and representatives.  Therefore, the financialstability of these distributors and representatives is important.  Theirability to operate, timely pay us, and to acquire any necessary financing maybe affected by the current economic climate.  Highly skilled professionalengineers use most of our products.  To be effective, third-party distributorsand representatives must possess significant technical, marketing, customerrelationships and sales resources and must devote their resources to salesefforts, customer education, training and support.  These required qualitieslimit the number of potential third-party distributors and representatives. Our business will suffer if we cannot attract and retain a sufficient number ofqualified third-party distributors and representatives to market our products.If we are unableto protect our intellectual property, we may not be able to compete effectivelyor operate profitably. We rely on patents,copyrights, trade secrets and trademarks to protect our intellectual property,as well as product development and marketing skill to establish and protect ourmarket position.  We attempt to protect our rights in proprietary softwareproducts, including our user interface, product firmware, software moduleoptions and other software products by retaining the title to and copyright ofthe software and documentation, by including appropriate contractualrestrictions on use and disclosure in our licenses, and by requiring ouremployees to execute non-disclosure agreements. Because of therapidly changing technology in the semiconductor, electronic equipment andsoftware industries, portions of our products might possibly infringe uponexisting patents or copyrights, and we may be required to obtain licenses ordiscontinue the use of the infringing technology.  We believe that any exposurewe may have regarding possible infringement claims is a reasonable businessrisk similar to that assumed by other companies in the electronic equipment andsoftware industries.  However, any claim of infringement, with or withoutmerit, could be costly and a diversion of management’s attention, and anadverse determination could adversely affect our reputation, preclude us fromoffering certain products, and subject us to substantial liability. We may pursue business acquisitionsthat could impair our financial position and profitability.We may pursueacquisitions of complementary technologies, product lines or businesses. Future acquisitions may include risks, such as: 14  ·        burdening management and ouroperating teams during the integration of the acquisition·        diverting management’s attentionfrom other business concerns·        failing to successfully integrateor monetize the acquired products or technologies·        lack of acceptance of the acquiredproducts by our sales channels or customers·        entering markets where we have noor limited prior experience·        potential loss of key employees ofthe acquired company·        additional burden of support foran acquired programmer architectureFuture acquisitions may also impact ourfinancial position.  For example, we may use significant cash or incur debt,which would weaken our balance sheet, or issue additional shares, potentiallydiluting existing shareholders.  We may also capitalize goodwill and intangibleassets acquired, the impairment of which would reduce our profitability.  Wecannot guarantee that future acquisitions will improve our business oroperating results.The loss of keyemployees may adversely affect our operations. We have employees located in the U.S.,Germany and China.  We also utilize independent contractors for specialty work,primarily in research and development, and utilize temporary workers to adjustcapacity to fluctuating demand.  Many of our employees are highly skilled andour continued success will depend in part upon our ability to attract andretain employees who can be in great demand within the industry.  None of ouremployees are represented by a collective bargaining unit and we believerelations with our employees are favorable, though no assurance can be madethat this will be the case in the future.  In China, our workers are “leased”with the arrangements made under the “FSCO” labor agreement and we could beadversely affected if we were unable to continue that arrangement.Failure tocomply with increasing regulatory requirements may adversely affect our stockprice and business.As a publiccompany, we are subject to numerous governmental and stock exchangerequirements, with which we believe we are in compliance.  Our failure to meetregulatory requirements and exchange listing standards may result in actionssuch as: the delisting of our stock, impacting our stock’s liquidity; SECenforcement actions; and securities claims and litigation.The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and theSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have requirements that we may fail tomeet or we may fall out of compliance with, such as the internal controlsauditor attestation required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of2002, with which we are not currently required to comply as we are a smallerreporting company.  We assume that we will continue to have the status of asmaller reporting company based on the aggregate market value of the voting andnon-voting shares held as of June 30, 2015.  If we fail to achieve and maintainthe adequacy of our internal controls, as such standards are modified,supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that wecan conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls overfinancial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of2002.  Moreover, effective internal controls, particularly those related torevenue recognition, are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reportsand are important to help prevent financial fraud.  If we cannot providereliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating resultscould be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financialinformation, and the trading price of our stock could drop significantly.  While we have policies and procedures inplace designed to prevent corruption and bribery, because our business is significantlyinternational, violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) couldhave a significant adverse effect on our business due to the disruption anddistraction of an investigation, financial penalties and criminal penalties.Government regulations regarding theuse of ""conflict"" minerals could adversely affect our prospectsand results of operations.Regulatory requirements regarding disclosureof our use of “conflict” minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congoand adjoining countries could affect the sourcing and availability of mineralsused in the manufacture of certain products. Although we do not buy rawmaterials, manufacture, or produce any electronic equipment using conflictminerals directly, some components provided by our suppliers and contained inour products contain conflict minerals.  Our goal is for our products to be conflict free.  As a result, there may only be a limited pool of suppliers who provide conflict free metals, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices.  Single source suppliers may not respond or respond negatively regarding conflict mineral sourcing and we may be unable to find alternative sources to replace them.  Also, because our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all metals used in the products that we sell.  Further, if we are unable to comply with the new laws or regulations or if our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us.  We may need to incur additional costs and invest additional resources, including management’s time, in order to comply with the new regulations and anticipated additional reporting and disclosure obligations.15    We may need to raise additional capital and our future access to capital is uncertain.Our past revenues have sometimes been, and our future revenues may again be, insufficient to support the expense of our operations and any expansion of our business.  We may therefore need additional equity or debt capital to finance our operations.  If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or to obtain funds through additional debt, lease or equity financing, we may have to reduce some or all of our development and sales and marketing efforts and limit the expansion of our business.  We believe that we have sufficient cash or working capital available under our operating plan to fund our operations and capital requirements through at least the next one-year period.  In the event we may require additional cash for U.S. operations or other needs, it may cause the potential repatriation of cash from the $6.2 million held in our foreign subsidiaries.  Although we have no current repatriation plans, there may be tax, legal and other impediments to any repatriation actions.  Our working capital may be used to fund possible losses, business growth, project initiatives, share repurchases and business development initiatives including acquisitions, which could reduce our liquidity and result in a requirement for additional cash before that time.  Any substantial inability to achieve our current business plan could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, liquidity, or results of operations and may require us to reduce expenditures and/or seek additional financing.Therefore, we may seek additional funding through public or private debt or equity financing or from other sources.  We have no commitments for additional financing, and given the current economic climate and our financial results, we may experience difficulty in obtaining funding on favorable terms, if at all.  Any financing we obtain may contain covenants that restrict our freedom to operate our business or may require us to issue securities that have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our Common Stock and may dilute your ownership interest.Our stock price may be volatile and, as a result, you may lose some or all of your investment.The stock prices of technology companies tend to fluctuate significantly.  We believe factors such as announcements of new products or services by us or our competitors and quarterly variations in financial results and outlook may cause the market price of our Common Stock to fluctuate substantially.  In addition, overall volatility in the stock market, particularly in the technology company sector, is often unrelated to the operating performance of companies.  If these market fluctuations continue in the future, they may adversely affect the price of our Common Stock.  Cyber security breaches or terrorism could result in liabilities or costs as well as damage to or loss of our data or customer access to our website and information systems.  The collection, storage, transmission, use and disclosure of user data and personal information, if accessed improperly, could give rise to liabilities or additional costs as a result of laws, governmental regulations and evolving views of personal privacy rights. Cyber security breaches or terrorism could result in the exposure or theft of private or confidential information as well as interrupt our business, including denying customer access to our website and information systems.  We transmit, and in some cases store, end-user data, including personal information.  In jurisdictions around the world, personal information is becoming increasingly subject to legislation and regulations intended to protect consumers’ privacy and security.  The interpretation of privacy and data protection laws and regulations regarding the collection, storage, transmission, use and disclosure of such information in some jurisdictions is unclear and evolving.  These laws may be interpreted and applied in conflicting ways from country to country and in a manner that is not consistent with our current data protection practices.  Complying with these varying international requirements could cause us to incur additional costs and change our business practices.  Because our services are accessible in many foreign jurisdictions, some of these jurisdictions may claim that we are required to comply with their laws, even where we have no local entity, employees or infrastructure.  We could be forced to incur significant expenses if we were required to modify our products, our services or our existing security and privacy procedures in order to comply with new or expanded regulations"

 Cautionary Factors That May Affect Future Results Our disclosure and analysis in this Annual Report contains some forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements include our current expectations or forecasts of future events.  The reader can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.  In particular, these include statements relating to future action, prospective products, new technologies, establishing foreign operations, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, outsourcing of functions, outcome of contingencies, impact of regulatory requirements, restructure actions and financial results.Any or all of the forward-looking statements in this Annual Report or in any other public statement made may turn out to be wrong.  They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make, or known or unknown risks and uncertainties can affect these forward-looking statements.  Many factors -- for example, product competition and product development -- will be important in determining future results.  Moreover, neither Data I/O nor anyone else assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of these forward-looking statements.  Actual future results may materially vary.We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements after the date of this Annual Report, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  The reader should not unduly rely on our forward-looking statements.  The reader is advised, however, to consult any future disclosures we make on related subjects in our 10-Q, 8-K and 10-K reports to the SEC and press releases.  Also, note that we provide the following cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and possible inaccurate assumptions relevant to our business.  These are factors that we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results.  Other factors besides those listed here could also adversely affect us.  This discussion is permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.10      RISK FACTORSDelays in development, introduction and shipment of new products or services may result in a decline in sales or increased costs.We develop new engineering and automated programming systems and services.  Significant technological, supplier, manufacturing or other problems may delay the development, introduction or production of these products or services.For example, we may encounter these problems: ·         technical problems in the development of a new programming system platform or the robotics for new automated handing systems·         inability to hire qualified personnel or turnover in existing personnel·         delays or failures to perform by us or third parties involved in our development projects·         development of new products or services that are not accepted by the marketThese problems may result in a decline in sales or increased costs.Quarterly fluctuations in our operating results may adversely affect our stock price.Our operating results tend to vary from quarter to quarter.  Our revenue in each quarter substantially depends upon orders received within that quarter.  Conversely, our expenditures are based on investment plans and estimates of future revenues.  We may, therefore, be unable to quickly reduce our spending if our revenues decline in a given quarter.  As a result, operating results for that quarter will suffer.  Our results of operations for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future periods.Other factors, which may cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate, include:·         increased competition ·         timing of new product announcements and timing of development expenditures·         product or service releases and pricing changes by us or our competitors·         market acceptance or delays in the introduction of new products or services·         production constraints·         quality issues·         labor or material·         timing of significant orders·         timing of installation or customer acceptance requirements·         sales channel mix of direct vs. indirect distribution·         civil unrest, war or terrorism·         health issues (such as the outbreak of a virus impacting workers or travel)·         customers’ budgets·         adverse movements in exchange rates, interest rates or tax rates11      ·         cyclical and seasonal nature of demand for our customers’ products·         general economic conditions in the countries where we sell products·         expenses and obtaining authorizations in setting up new operations or locations·         facilities relocationsDue to any of the foregoing factors, it is possible that in some future quarters, our operating results will be below expectations of analysts and investors.Our international operations may expose us to additional risks that may adversely affect our business.International sales represented approximately 90%, 88%, and 83% of our net revenue for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.  We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of our net revenue.  International sales may fluctuate due to various factors, including:·        fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; with a significant impact due to the recent strength of the U.S. Dollar and relative weakness of the Euro, as 39% of our 2014 sales were European-based and of those, a large portion of sales through our German subsidiary are denominated in Euros.  Because 90% of our sales are to international markets, volatile exchange rates may also impact our competiveness and margins·         economic uncertainty related to the European sovereign debt situation·

date of July 2017.  Failure to meet applicable directives or qualifying exemptions may prevent us from marketing certain products in Europe or other territories with similar requirements.  We have subsidiaries in Germany, China, Hong Kong, Brazil and Canada and large balances of cash are in our foreign subsidiaries (with 45% in China).  Our business and financial condition is sensitive to currency exchange rates and any restrictions imposed on their currencies including restrictions on repatriations of cash.  Any repatriation of cash could result in tax costs and corresponding deferred tax assets with related tax valuation allowances.  Currency exchange fluctuations in these countries may adversely affect our investment in our subsidiaries.12      A decline in economic and market

obsolete.Certain of our sockets, parts and boards are currently manufactured to our specifications by third-party foreign contract manufacturers and we are sourcing certain parts or options from foreign manufacturers.  We may not be able to obtain a sufficient quantity of these products if and when needed or the quality of these parts or options may not meet our standards, which may result in lost sales.If we are unable to attract and retain qualified third-party distributors and representatives, our business may be adversely affected.We have an internal sales force and also utilize third-party distributors and representatives.  Therefore, the financial stability of these distributors and representatives is important.  Their ability to operate, timely pay us, and to acquire any necessary financing may be affected by the current economic climate.  Highly skilled professional engineers use most of our products.  To be effective, third-party distributors and representatives must possess significant technical, marketing, customer relationships and sales resources and must devote their resources to sales efforts, customer education, training and support.  These required qualities limit the number of potential third-party distributors and representatives.  Our business will suffer if we cannot attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified third-party distributors and representatives to market our products.If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, we may not be able to compete effectively or operate profitably. We rely on patents, copyrights, trade secrets and trademarks to protect our intellectual property, as well as product development and marketing skill to establish and protect our market position.  We attempt to protect our rights in proprietary software products, including our user interface, product firmware, software module options and other software products by retaining the title to and copyright of the software and documentation, by including appropriate contractual restrictions on use and disclosure in our licenses, and by requiring our employees to execute non-disclosure agreements. Because of the rapidly changing technology in the semiconductor, electronic equipment and software industries, portions of our products might possibly infringe upon existing patents or copyrights, and we may be required to obtain licenses or discontinue the use of the infringing technology.  We believe that any exposure we may have regarding possible infringement claims is a reasonable business risk similar to that assumed by other companies in the electronic equipment and software industries.  However, any claim of infringement, with or without merit, could be costly and a diversion of management’s attention, and an adverse determination could adversely affect our reputation, preclude us from offering certain products, and subject us to substantial liability. 14       We may pursue business acquisitions that could impair our financial position and profitability.We may pursue acquisitions of complementary technologies, product lines or businesses.  Future acquisitions may include risks, such as: ·         burdening management and our operating teams during the integration of the acquisition·         diverting management’s attention from other business concerns·         failing to successfully integrate or monetize the acquired products or technologies·         lack of acceptance of the acquired products by our sales channels or customers·         entering markets where we have no or limited prior experience·         potential loss of key employees of the acquired company·         additional burden of support for an acquired programmer architectureFuture acquisitions may also impact our financial position.  For example, we may use significant cash or incur additional debt, which would weaken our balance sheet.  We may also capitalize goodwill and intangible assets acquired, the impairment of which would reduce our profitability.  We cannot guarantee that future acquisitions will improve our business or operating results.The loss of key employees may adversely affect our operations. We have employees located in the U.S., Germany and China.  We also utilize independent contractors for specialty work, primarily in research and development, and utilize temporary workers to adjust capacity to fluctuating demand.  Many of our employees are highly skilled and our continued success will depend in part upon our ability to attract and retain employees who can be in great demand within the industry.  None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit and we believe relations with our employees are favorable, though no assurance can be made that this will be the case in the future.  In China, our workers are “leased” with the arrangements made under the “FSCO” labor agreement and we could be adversely affected if we were unable to continue that arrangement.Failure to comply with regulatory requirements may adversely affect our stock price and business.As a public company, we are subject to numerous governmental and stock exchange requirements, with which we believe we are in compliance.  Our failure to meet regulatory requirements and exchange listing standards may result in actions such as: the delisting of our stock, impacting our stock’s liquidity; SEC enforcement actions; and securities claims and litigation.The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have requirements that we may fail to meet or we may fall out of compliance with, such as the internal controls auditor attestation required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, with which we are not currently required to comply as we are a smaller reporting company.  We assume that we will continue to have the status of a smaller reporting company based on the aggregate market value of the voting and non-voting shares held as of June 30, 2014.  If we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  Moreover, effective internal controls, particularly those related to revenue recognition, are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent financial fraud.  If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our stock could drop significantly.  While we have policies and procedures in place designed to prevent corruption and bribery, because our business is significantly international, violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) could have a significant adverse effect on our business due to the disruption and distraction of an investigation, financial penalties and criminal penalties.15      Government regulations regarding the use of ""conflict"" minerals could adversely affect our prospects and results of operations.Regulatory requirements regarding disclosure of our use of “conflict” minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries could affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of certain products. Although we do not buy raw materials, manufacture, or produce any electronic equipment using conflict minerals directly, some components provided by our suppliers and contained in our products contain conflict minerals.  Our goal is for our products to be conflict free.  As a result, there may only be a limited pool of suppliers who provide conflict free metals, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices.  Single source suppliers may not respond or respond negatively regarding conflict mineral sourcing and we may be unable to find alternative sources to replace them.  Also, because our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all metals used in the products that we sell.  Further, if we are unable to comply with the new laws or regulations or if our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us.  We may need to incur additional costs and invest additional resources, including management’s time, in order to comply with the new regulations and anticipated additional reporting and disclosure obligations.We may need to raise additional capital and our future access to capital is uncertain.Our past revenues have sometimes been, and our future revenues may again be, insufficient to support the expense of our operations and any expansion of our business.  We may therefore need additional equity or debt capital to finance our operations.  If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or to obtain funds through additional debt, lease or equity financing, we may have to reduce some or all of our development and sales and marketing efforts and limit the expansion of our business.  We believe that we have sufficient cash or working capital available under our operating plan to fund our operations and capital requirements through at least the next one-year period.  In the event we may require additional cash for U.S. operations, it may cause the potential repatriation of cash from the $6.7 million held in our foreign subsidiaries.  Although we have no current repatriation plans, there may be tax, legal and other impediments to any repatriation actions.  Our working capital may be used to fund possible losses, business growth, project initiatives, share repurchases and business development initiatives including acquisitions, which could reduce our liquidity and result in a requirement for additional cash before that time.  Any substantial inability to achieve our current business plan could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, liquidity, or results of operations and may require us to reduce expenditures and/or seek additional financing.Therefore, we may seek additional funding through public or private debt or equity financing or from other sources.  We have no commitments for additional financing, and given the current economic climate and our financial results, we may experience difficulty in obtaining funding on favorable terms, if at all.  Any financing we obtain may contain covenants that restrict our freedom to operate our business or may require us to issue securities that have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our Common Stock and may dilute your ownership interest.Our stock price may be volatile and, as a result, you may lose some or all of your investment.The stock prices of technology companies tend to fluctuate significantly.  We believe factors such as announcements of new products or services by us or our competitors and quarterly variations in financial results and outlook may cause the market price of our Common Stock to fluctuate substantially.  In addition, overall volatility in the stock market, particularly in the technology company sector, is often unrelated to the operating performance of companies.  If these market fluctuations continue in the future, they may adversely affect the price of our Common Stock.  Cyber security breaches or terrorism could result in liabilities or costs as well as damage to or loss of our data or customer access to our website and information systems.  The collection, storage, transmission, use and disclosure of user data and personal information, if accessed improperly, could give rise to liabilities or additional costs as a result of laws, governmental regulations and evolving views of personal privacy rights. Cyber security breaches or terrorism could result in the exposure or theft of private or confidential information as well as interrupt our business, including denying customer access to our website and information systems.  We transmit, and in some cases store, end-user data, including personal information.  In jurisdictions around the world, personal information is becoming increasingly subject to legislation and regulations intended to protect consumers’ privacy and security.  The interpretation of privacy and data protection laws and regulations regarding the collection, storage, transmission, use and disclosure of such information in some jurisdictions is unclear and evolving.  These laws may be interpreted and applied in conflicting ways from country to country and in a manner that is not consistent with our current data protection practices.  Complying with these varying international requirements could cause us to incur additional costs and change our business practices.  Because our services are accessible in many foreign jurisdictions, some of these jurisdictions may claim that we are required to comply with their laws, even where we have no local entity, employees or infrastructure.  We could be forced to incur significant expenses if we were required to modify our products, our services or our existing security and privacy procedures in order to comply with new or expanded regulations.16      "

 Cautionary Factors That May Affect Future Results Our disclosure and analysis in this Annual Report contains some forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements include our current expectations or forecasts of future events.  The reader can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.  In particular, these include statements relating to future action, prospective products, new technologies, establishing foreign operations, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, outsourcing of functions, outcome of contingencies, impact of regulatory requirements, restructure actions and financial results.Any or all of the forward-looking statements in this Annual Report or in any other public statement made may turn out to be wrong.  They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make, or known or unknown risks and uncertainties can affect these forward-looking statements.  Many factors -- for example, product competition and product development -- will be important in determining future results.  Moreover, neither Data I/O nor anyone else assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of these forward-looking statements.  Actual future results may materially vary.We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements after the date of this Annual Report, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  The reader should not unduly rely on our forward-looking statements.  The reader is advised, however, to consult any future disclosures we make on related subjects in our 10-Q, 8-K and 10-K reports to the SEC and press releases.  Also, note that we provide the following cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and possible inaccurate assumptions relevant to our business.  These are factors that we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results.  Other factors besides those listed here could also adversely affect us.  This discussion is permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.10    RISK FACTORSA decline in economic and market conditions may result in decreased capital spending and delayed or defaulted payments from our customers.Our business is highly impacted by capital spending plans and other economic cycles that affect the users and manufacturers of integrated circuits.  These industries are highly cyclical and are characterized by rapid technological change, short product life cycles and fluctuations in manufacturing capacity and pricing and gross margin pressures.  As we experienced in recent years and are currently experiencing, our operations may in the future reflect substantial fluctuations from period-to-period as a consequence of these industry patterns, general economic conditions affecting the timing of orders from major customers, and other factors affecting capital spending.  In a difficult economic climate it may take us longer to receive payments from our customers and some of our customers’ business may fail, resulting in non-payment.    These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.Delays in development, introduction and shipment of new products or services may result in a decline in sales or increased costs.We develop new engineering and automated programming systems and services.  Significant technological, supplier, manufacturing or other problems may delay the development, introduction or production of these products or services.For example, we may encounter these problems: ·     technical problems in the development of a new programming system platform or the robotics for new automated handing systems·     inability to hire qualified personnel or turnover in existing personnel·     delays or failures to perform by us or third parties involved in our development projects·     development of new products or services that are not accepted by the marketThese problems may result in a decline in sales or increased costs.Quarterly fluctuations in our operating results may adversely affect our stock price.Our operating results tend to vary from quarter to quarter.  Our revenue in each quarter substantially depends upon orders received within that quarter.  Conversely, our expenditures are based on investment plans and estimates of future revenues.  We may, therefore, be unable to quickly reduce our spending if our revenues decline in a given quarter.  As a result, operating results for that quarter will suffer.  Our results of operations for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future periods.Other factors, which may cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate, include:·         increased competition ·         timing of new product announcements and timing of development expenditures·         product or service releases and pricing changes by us or our competitors·         market acceptance or delays in the introduction of new products or services·         production constraints·         quality issues·         labor or material·         timing of significant orders·         sales channel mix of direct vs. indirect distribution·         civil unrest, war or terrorism11     ·         health issues (such as the outbreak of a virus impacting workers or travel)·         customers’ budgets·         adverse movements in exchange rates, interest rates or tax rates·         cyclical and seasonal nature of demand for our customers’ products·         general economic conditions in the countries where we sell products·         expenses and obtaining authorizations in setting up new operations or locationsDue to any of the foregoing factors, it is possible that in some future quarters, our operating results will be below expectations of analysts and investors.Government regulations regarding the use of ""conflict"" minerals could adversely affect our prospects and results of operations.Regulatory requirements regarding disclosure of our use of “conflict” minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries could affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of certain products. Although we do not buy raw materials, manufacture, or produce any electronic equipment using conflict minerals directly, some components provided by our suppliers and contained in our products contain conflict minerals.  Our goal is for our products to be conflict free.  As a result, there may only be a limited pool of suppliers who provide conflict free metals, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices.  Single source suppliers may not respond or respond negatively regarding conflict mineral sourcing and we may be unable to find alternative sources to replace them.  Also, because our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all metals used in the products that we sell.  Further, if we are unable to comply with the new laws or regulations or if our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us.  We may need to incur additional costs and invest additional resources, including management’s time, in order to comply with the new regulations and anticipated additional reporting and disclosure obligations.Failure to adapt to technology trends in our industry may hinder our competitiveness and financial results.Product and service technology in our industry evolves rapidly, making timely product innovation essential to success in the marketplace.  Introducing products and services with improved technologies or features may render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable.  Technological advances and trends that may negatively impact our business include:  ·       new device package types, densities and technologies requiring hardware and software changes in order to be programmed by our products, particularly certain segments of the high density NAND and e-MMC markets where after placement programming is recommended by the semiconductor manufacturers·       Reduction in semiconductor process geometries for Multi Level Cell (MLC) and Triple Level Cell (TLC) NAND and eMMC FLASH memories impact the product data retention through SMT reflow.  Improper SMT process control can negatively impact the end customer’s ability to successfully program devices prior to placement in manufacturing.  This can cause them to change their programing methods away from pre-programming to post placement programming techniques, including ISP.  Data I/O is working with semiconductor manufacturers to develop best practices to minimize the impact of reflow induced data loss.·         electronics equipment manufacturing practices, such as widespread use of in-circuit programming·         customer software platform preferences different from those on which our products operate·         more rigid industry standards, which would decrease the value-added element of our products and support servicesIf we cannot develop products or services in a timely manner in response to industry changes, or if our products or services do not perform well, our business and financial condition may be adversely affected.  Also, our new products or services may contain defects or errors that give rise to product liability claims against us or cause our products to fail to gain market acceptance.  Our future success depends on our ability to successfully compete with other technology firms in attracting and retaining key technical personnel.12    We have a history of recent operating losses and may be unable to generate enough revenue to achieve and maintain profitability. We have incurred operating losses in three of the last five years and five of the last ten years.  We operate in a cyclical industry.  We will continue to examine our level of operating expense based upon our projected revenues.  Any planned increases in operating expenses may result in losses in future periods if projected revenues are not achieved.  As a result, we may need to generate greater revenues than we have recently in order to achieve and maintain profitability.  However, we cannot provide assurance that our revenues will increase and our business strategies may not be successful, resulting in future losses.We may need to raise additional capital and our future access to capital is uncertain.Our past revenues have sometimes been, and our future revenues may again be, insufficient to support the expense of our operations and any expansion of our business.  We may therefore need additional equity or debt capital to finance our operations.  If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or to obtain funds through additional debt, lease or equity financing, we may have to reduce some or all of our development and sales and marketing efforts and limit the expansion of our business.  We believe that we have sufficient cash or working capital available under our operating plan to fund our operations and capital requirements through at least the next one-year period.  We may require additional cash for U.S. operations, causing potential repatriation of cash from the $8.3 million held in our foreign subsidiaries.  Although we have no current repatriation plans, there may be tax and other impediments to any repatriation actions.  Our working capital may be used to fund possible losses, business growth, project initiatives, share repurchases and business development initiatives including acquisitions, which could reduce our liquidity and result in a requirement for additional cash before that time.  Any substantial inability to achieve our current business plan could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, liquidity, or results of operations and may require us to reduce expenditures and/or seek additional financing.Therefore, we may seek additional funding through public or private debt or equity financing or from other sources.  We have no commitments for additional financing, and given the current economic climate and our financial results, we may experience difficulty in obtaining funding on favorable terms, if at all.  Any financing we obtain may contain covenants that restrict our freedom to operate our business or may require us to issue securities that have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our Common Stock and may dilute your ownership interest.We may face increased competition and may not be able to compete successfully with current and future competitors.Technological advances have reduced the barriers of entry into the programming systems market.  We expect competition to increase from both established and emerging companies.  If we fail to compete successfully against current and future sources of competition, our profitability and financial performance will be adversely impacted.If our relationship with semiconductor manufacturers deteriorates, our business may be adversely affected.  We work closely with most semiconductor manufacturers to ensure that our programming systems comply with their requirements.  In addition, many semiconductor manufacturers recommend our programming systems for use by users of their programmable devices.  These working relationships enable us to keep our programming systems product lines up to date and provide end-users with broad and current programmable device support.  As technology changes occur that limit the effectiveness of pre-placement programming, particularly for very small high density NAND and e-MMC devices, certain semiconductor manufacturers are not recommending or may not continue recommending our programming systems for these devices.  Our business may be adversely affected if our relationships with semiconductor manufacturers deteriorate.Our reliance on a small number of suppliers may result in a shortage of key components, which may adversely affect our business, and our suppliers may experience financial difficulties which could impact their ability to service our needs.Certain parts used in our products are currently available from either a single supplier or from a limited number of suppliers.  If we cannot develop alternative sources of these components, if sales of parts are discontinued by the supplier, if we experience deterioration in our relationship with these suppliers, or if these suppliers require financing, which is not available, there may be delays or reductions in product introductions or shipments, which may materially adversely affect our operating results.13    Because we rely on a small number of suppliers for certain parts, we are subject to possible price increases by these suppliers.  Also, we may be unable to accurately forecast our production schedule.  If we underestimate our production schedule, suppliers may be unable to meet our demand for components.  This delay in the supply of key components may have a materially adverse effect on our business.  For suppliers who discontinue parts, we may be required to make lifetime purchases covering future requirements.  Over estimation of demand or excessive minimum order quantities will lead to excess inventories that may become obsolete.Certain of our sockets, parts and boards are currently manufactured to our specifications by third-party foreign contract manufacturers and we are sourcing certain parts or options from foreign manufacturers.  We may not be able to obtain a sufficient quantity of these products if and when needed or the quality of these parts or options may not meet our standards, which may result in lost sales.If we are unable to attract and retain qualified third-party distributors and representatives, our business may be adversely affected.We have an internal sales force and also utilize third-party distributors and representatives.  Therefore, the financial stability of these distributors and representatives is important.  Their ability to operate, timely pay us, and to acquire any necessary financing may be affected by the current economic climate.  Highly skilled professional engineers use most of our products.  To be effective, third-party distributors and representatives must possess significant technical, marketing and sales resources and must devote their resources to sales efforts, customer education, training and support.  These required qualities limit the number of potential third-party distributors and representatives.  Our business will suffer if we cannot attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified third-party distributors and representatives to market our products.Our international operations may expose us to additional risks that may adversely affect our business.International sales represented approximately 88%, 83% and 90% of our net revenue for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of our net revenue.  International sales may fluctuate due to various factors, including:·         economic uncertainty related to the European sovereign debt situation·         migration of manufacturing to low cost geographies·         unexpected changes in regulatory requirements·         tariffs and taxes·         difficulties in establishing, staffing and managing foreign operations·         longer average payment cycles and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable·         fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates ·         compliance with applicable export licensing requirements·         product safety and other certification requirements·         difficulties in integrating foreign and outsourced operations·         civil unrest, political and economic instabilityBecause we have customers located throughout the world, we have significant foreign receivables.  We may experience difficulties in collecting these amounts as a result of payment practices of certain foreign customers, economic uncertainty and regulations in foreign countries, the availability and reliability of foreign credit information, and potential difficulties in enforcing collection terms.  The European Union and European Free Trade Association (“EU”) has established certain electronic emission and product safety requirements (“CE”).  As applicable, our products currently meet these requirements; however, failure to obtain either a CE certification or a waiver for any product may prevent us from marketing that product in Europe.  The EU also has directives concerning the Reduction of Hazardous Substances (“RoHS”) and we believe we are classified within the EU RoHS Directive category list as Industrial Monitoring and Control Equipment (category 9), which is out of scope until the enforcement date of July 2017.  Failure to meet applicable directives or qualifying exemptions may prevent us from marketing certain products in Europe or other territories with similar requirements.  14     We have subsidiaries in Germany, China, Hong Kong, Brazil and Canada.  Our business and financial condition is sensitive to currency exchange rates and any restrictions imposed on their currencies including restrictions on repatriations of cash.  Any repatriation of cash could result in tax costs and corresponding deferred tax assets with related tax valuation allowances.  Currency exchange fluctuations in these countries may adversely affect our investment in our subsidiaries.If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, we may not be able to compete effectively or operate profitably. We rely on patents, copyrights, trade secrets and trademarks to protect our intellectual property, as well as product development and marketing skill to establish and protect our market position.  We attempt to protect our rights in proprietary software products, including our user interface, product firmware, software module options and other software products by retaining the title to and copyright of the software and documentation, by including appropriate contractual restrictions on use and disclosure in our licenses, and by requiring our employees to execute non-disclosure agreements. Because of the rapidly changing technology in the semiconductor, electronic equipment and software industries, portions of our products might possibly infringe upon existing patents or copyrights, and we may be required to obtain licenses or discontinue the use of the infringing technology.  We believe that any exposure we may have regarding possible infringement claims is a reasonable business risk similar to that assumed by other companies in the electronic equipment and software industries.  However, any claim of infringement, with or without merit, could be costly and a diversion of management’s attention, and an adverse determination could adversely affect our reputation, preclude us from offering certain products, and subject us to substantial liability. We may pursue business acquisitions that could impair our financial position and profitability.We may pursue acquisitions of complementary technologies, product lines or businesses.  Future acquisitions may include risks, such as: ·         burdening management and our operating teams during the integration of the acquisition·         diverting management’s attention from other business concerns·         failing to successfully integrate or monetize the acquired products or technologies·         lack of acceptance of the acquired products by our sales channels or customers·         entering markets where we have no or limited prior experience·         potential loss of key employees of the acquired company·         additional burden of support for an acquired programmer architectureFuture acquisitions may also impact our financial position.  For example, we may use significant cash or incur additional debt, which would weaken our balance sheet.  We may also capitalize goodwill and intangible assets acquired, the impairment of which would reduce our profitability.  We cannot guarantee that future acquisitions will improve our business or operating results.The loss of key employees may adversely affect our operations. We have employees located in the U.S., Germany and China.  We also utilize independent

in the technology company sector, is often unrelated to the operating performance of companies.  If these market fluctuations continue in the future, they may adversely affect the price of our Common Stock.  Cyber security breaches or terrorism could result in liabilities or costs as well as damage to or loss of our data or customer access to our website and information systems.  The collection,

world, personal information is becoming increasingly subject to legislation and regulations intended to protect consumers’ privacy and security.  The interpretation of privacy and data protection laws and regulations regarding the collection, storage, transmission, use and disclosure of such information in some jurisdictions is unclear and evolving.  These laws may be interpreted and applied in conflicting ways from country to country and in a manner that is not consistent with our current data protection practices.  Complying with these varying international requirements could cause us to incur additional costs and change our business practices.  Because our services are accessible in many foreign jurisdictions, some of these jurisdictions may claim that we are required to comply with their laws, even where we have no local entity, employees or infrastructure.  We could be forced to incur significant expenses if we were required to modify our products, our services or our existing

statements.  The reader is advised, however, to consult any future disclosures we make on related subjects in our 10-Q, 8-K and 10-K reports to the SEC and press releases.  Also, note that we provide the following cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and possible inaccurate assumptions relevant to our business.  These are factors that we think could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results.  Other factors besides those listed here could also adversely affect us.  This discussion is permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.RISK FACTORSA decline in economic and market conditions may result in decreased capital spending and delayed or defaulted payments from our customers.Our business is highly impacted by capital spending plans and other economic cycles that affect the users and manufacturers of integrated circuits.  These industries are highly cyclical and are characterized by rapid technological change, short product life cycles and fluctuations in manufacturing capacity and pricing and gross margin pressures.  As we experienced in recent years and are currently experiencing, our operations may in the future reflect substantial fluctuations from period-to-period as a consequence of these industry patterns, general economic conditions affecting the timing of orders from major customers, and other factors affecting capital spending.  In a difficult economic climate it may take us longer to receive payments from our customers and some of our customers’ business may fail, resulting in non-payment.  We may require additional cash in our U.S. operations causing repatriation of cash and resulting in tax costs and related tax valuation allowances.  These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.Delays in development, introduction and shipment of new products or services may result in a decline in sales.We develop new engineering and automated programming systems and services.  Significant technological, supplier, manufacturing or other problems may delay the development, introduction or production of these products or services.For example, we may encounter these problems: ·     technical problems in the development of a new programming system platform or the robotics for new automated handing systems·     inability to hire qualified personnel·      delays or failures to perform by third parties involved in our development projects·     development of new products or services that are not accepted by the marketThese problems may result in a decline in sales.Quarterly fluctuations in our operating results may adversely affect our stock price.Our operating results tend to vary from quarter to quarter.  Our revenue in each quarter substantially depends upon orders received within that quarter.  Conversely, our expenditures are based on investment plans and estimates of future revenues.  We may, therefore, be unable to quickly reduce our spending if our revenues decline in a given quarter.  As a result, operating results for that quarter will suffer.  Our results of operations for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future periods.Other factors, which may cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate, include:·         increased competition 10     ·         timing of new product announcements and timing of development expenditures·         product or service releases and pricing changes by us or our competitors·         market acceptance or delays in the introduction of new products or services·         production constraints·         quality issues·         labor or material shortages (such as supply chain disruptions from the earthquake in Japan)·         the timing of significant orders·         the sales channel mix of direct vs. indirect distribution·         civil unrest, war or terrorism·         health issues (such as the outbreak of a virus)·         customers’ budgets·         adverse movements in exchange rates, interest rates or tax rates·         cyclical and seasonal nature of demand for our customers’ products·         general economic conditions in the countries where we sell products·         expenses and obtaining authorizations in setting up new operations or locationsDue to any of the foregoing factors, it is possible that in some future quarters, our operating results will be below expectations of analysts and investors.Failure to adapt to technology trends in our industry may hinder our competitiveness and financial results.Product and service technology in our industry evolves rapidly, making timely product innovation essential to success in the marketplace.  Introducing products and services with improved technologies or features may render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable.  Technological advances that may negatively impact our business include:  ·      new device package types, densities and technologies requiring hardware and software changes in order to be programmed by our products, particularly certain segments of the high density NAND and e-MMC markets where after placement programming is recommended by the semiconductor manufacturers·     electronics equipment manufacturing practices, such as widespread use of in-circuit programming·     customer software platform preferences different from those on which our products operate·     more rigid industry standards, which would decrease the value-added element of our products and support servicesIf we cannot develop products or services in a timely manner in response to industry changes, or if our products or services do not perform well, our business and financial condition may be adversely affected.  Also, our new products or services may contain defects or errors that give rise to product liability claims against us or cause our products to fail to gain market acceptance.  Our future success depends on our ability to successfully compete with other technology firms in attracting and retaining key technical personnel.We have a history of recent operating losses and may be unable to generate enough revenue to achieve and maintain profitability.We have incurred operating losses in two of the last five years and five of the last ten years.  We operate in a cyclical industry.  We will continue to examine our level of operating expense based upon our projected revenues.  Any planned increases in operating expenses may result in losses in future periods if projected revenues are not achieved.  As a result, we may need to generate greater revenues than we have recently in order to achieve and maintain profitability.  However, we cannot provide assurance that our revenues will increase and our business strategies may not be successful, resulting in future losses.11    We may need to raise additional capital and our future access to capital is uncertain.Our past revenues have sometimes been, and our future revenues may again be, insufficient to support the expense of our operations and any expansion of our business.  We may therefore need additional equity or debt capital to finance our operations.  If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or to obtain funds through additional debt or equity financing, we may have to reduce some or all of our development and sales and marketing efforts and limit the expansion of our business.  We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months.  We may require additional cash in our U.S. operations causing potential repatriation of cash from the $8 million held in our foreign operations, which could result in tax costs and related tax valuation allowances.  Thereafter, depending on the development of our business, we may need to raise additional cash for working capital or other expenses.  We may also encounter opportunities for acquisitions or other business initiatives that require significant cash commitments, or unanticipated problems or expenses that could result in a requirement for additional cash before that time.Therefore, we may seek additional funding through public or private debt or equity financing or from other sources.  We have no commitments for additional financing, and given the current economic climate and our financial results, we may experience difficulty in obtaining funding on favorable terms, if at all.  Any financing we obtain may contain covenants that restrict our freedom to operate our business or may require us to issue securities that have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our Common Stock and may dilute your ownership interest.We may face increased competition and may not be able to compete successfully with current and future competitors.Technological advances have reduced the barriers of entry into the programming systems market.  We expect competition to increase from both established and emerging companies.  If we fail to compete successfully against current and future sources of competition, our profitability and financial performance will be adversely impacted.If our relationship with semiconductor manufacturers deteriorates, our business may be adversely affected.  We work closely with most semiconductor manufacturers to ensure that our programming systems comply with their requirements.  In addition, many semiconductor manufacturers recommend our programming systems for use by users of their programmable devices.  These working relationships enable us to keep our programming systems product lines up to date and provide end-users with broad and current programmable device support.  As technology changes are occurring that limit the effectiveness of pre-placement programming, particularly for very small high density NAND and e-MMC devices, certain semiconductor manufacturers are not recommending or may not continue recommending our programming systems for these devices.  Our business may be adversely affected if our relationships with semiconductor manufacturers deteriorate.Our reliance on a small number of suppliers may result in a shortage of key components, which may adversely affect our business, and our suppliers may experience financial difficulties which could impact their ability to service our needs.Certain parts used in our products are currently available from either a single supplier or from a limited number of suppliers.  If we cannot develop alternative sources of these components, if sales of parts are discontinued by the supplier, if we experience deterioration in our relationship with these suppliers, or if these suppliers require financing, which is not available, there may be delays or reductions in product introductions or shipments, which may materially adversely affect our operating results.Because we rely on a small number of suppliers for certain parts, we are subject to possible price increases by these suppliers.  Also, we may be unable to accurately forecast our production schedule.  If we underestimate our production schedule, suppliers may be unable to meet our demand for components.  This delay in the supply of key components may have a materially adverse effect on our business.  Over estimation of demand will lead to excess inventories that may become obsolete.Certain of our sockets, parts and boards are currently manufactured to our specifications by a third-party foreign contract manufacturers and we are sourcing certain parts or options from foreign manufacturers.  We may not be able to obtain a sufficient quantity of these products if and when needed or the quality of these parts or options may not meet our standards, which may result in lost sales.12    If we are unable to attract and retain qualified third-party distributors and representatives, our business may be adversely affected.We have an internal sales force and also utilize third-party distributors and representatives.  Therefore, the financial stability of these distributors and representatives is important.  Their ability to operate, timely pay us, and to acquire any necessary financing may be affected by the current economic climate.  Highly skilled professional engineers use most of our products.  To be effective, third-party distributors and representatives must possess significant technical, marketing and sales resources and must devote their resources to sales efforts, customer education, training and support.  These required qualities limit the number of potential third-party distributors and representatives.  Our business will suffer if we cannot attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified third-party distributors and representatives to market our products.Our international operations may expose us to additional risks that may adversely affect our business.International sales represented approximately 83%, 90% and 88% of our net revenue for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.  We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of our net revenue.  International sales may fluctuate due to various factors, including:·         economic uncertainty related to the European sovereign debt situation·         migration of manufacturing to low cost geographies·         unexpected changes in regulatory requirements·         tariffs and taxes·         difficulties in establishing, staffing and managing foreign operations·         longer average payment cycles and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable·         fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates ·         compliance with applicable export licensing requirements·         product safety and other certification requirements·         difficulties in integrating foreign and outsourced operations·         civil unrest, political and economic instabilityBecause we have customers located throughout the world, we have significant foreign receivables.  We may experience difficulties in collecting these amounts as a result of payment practices of certain foreign customers, economic uncertainty in foreign countries, the availability and reliability of foreign credit information, and potential difficulties in enforcing collection terms.  The European Union and European Free Trade Association (“EU”) has established certain electronic emission and product safety requirements (“CE”).  As applicable, our products currently meet these requirements; however, failure to obtain either a CE certification or a waiver for any product may prevent us from marketing that product in Europe.  The EU also has directives concerning the Reduction of Hazardous Substances (“RoHS”) from which we are relying on an exemption for test and measurement companies.  Failure to meet applicable directives or qualifying exemptions may prevent us from marketing certain products in Europe or other territories with similar requirements.  We have subsidiaries in Germany, China, Hong Kong, Brazil and Canada.  Our business and financial condition is sensitive to currency exchange rates and any restrictions imposed on their currencies including restrictions on repatriations of cash.  Any repatriation of cash is expected to have tax costs and the related foreign tax deduction or credit will require additional tax valuation allowance.  Currency exchange fluctuations in these countries may adversely affect our investment in our subsidiaries.If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, we may not be able to compete effectively or operate profitably. We rely on patents, copyrights, trade secrets and trademarks to protect our intellectual property, as well as product development and marketing skill to establish and protect our market position.  We attempt to protect our rights in proprietary software products, including TaskLink, our intellectual property software, and other software products by 13    retaining the title to and copyright of the software and documentation, by including appropriate contractual restrictions on use and disclosure in our licenses, and by requiring our employees to execute non-disclosure agreements. Because of the rapidly changing technology in the semiconductor, electronic equipment and software industries, portions of our products might possibly infringe upon existing patents or copyrights, and we may be required to obtain licenses or discontinue the use of the infringing technology.  We believe that any exposure we may have regarding possible infringement claims is a reasonable business risk similar to that assumed by other companies in the electronic equipment and software industries.  However, any claim of infringement, with or without merit, could be costly and a diversion of management’s attention, and an adverse determination could adversely affect our reputation, preclude us from offering certain products, and subject us to substantial liability. We may pursue business acquisitions that could impair our financial position and profitability.We may pursue acquisitions of complementary technologies, product lines or businesses.  Future acquisitions may include risks, such as: ·         burdening management and our operating teams during the integration of the acquisition·         diverting management’s attention from other business concerns·         failing to successfully integrate or monetize the acquired products or technologies·         lack of acceptance of the acquired products by our sales channels or customers·         entering markets where we have no or limited prior experience·         potential loss of key employees of the acquired company·         additional burden of support for an acquired programmer architectureFuture acquisitions may also impact our financial position.  For example, we may use significant cash or incur additional debt, which would weaken our balance sheet.  We may also capitalize goodwill and intangible assets acquired, the impairment of which would reduce our profitability.  We cannot guarantee that future acquisitions will improve our business or operating results.The loss of key employees may adversely affect our operations. We have employees located in the U.S., Germany and China.  We also utilize independent contractors for specialty work, primarily in research and development, and utilize temporary workers to adjust capacity to fluctuating demand.  Many of our employees are highly skilled and our continued success will depend in part upon our ability to attract and retain employees who can be in great demand within the industry.  None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit and we believe relations with our employees are favorable, though no assurance can be made that this will be the case in the future.  In China, our workers are “leased” with the arrangements made under the “FSCO” labor agreement and we could be adversely affected if we were unable to continue that arrangement.Our Chief Executive Officer transition involves significant risks that may adversely affect our business. Mr. Ambrose, our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”), joined Data I/O in the fourth quarter of 2012.  He is in the process of assessing our business and refining our strategy and operations.  The new CEO transition could be disruptive to the organization, business plans, and retention of other team members which could have a material adverse effect on our business or operations. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements may adversely affect our stock price and business.As a public company, we are subject to numerous governmental and stock exchange requirements, with which we believe we are in compliance.  Our failure to meet regulatory requirements and exchange listing standards may result in actions such as: the delisting of our stock, impacting our stock’s liquidity; SEC enforcement actions; and securities claims and litigation.The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have requirements that we may fail to meet by the required deadlines or we may fall out of compliance with, such as the internal controls auditor attestation 14    required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, with which we are not currently required to comply as we are a smaller reporting company.  We assume that we will continue to have the status of a smaller reporting company based on the aggregate market value of the voting and non-voting shares held as of June 30, 2012.  If we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  Moreover, effective internal controls, particularly those related to revenue recognition, are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent financial fraud.  If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our stock could drop significantly.  While we have policies and procedures in place designed to prevent corruption and bribery, because our business is 83% international, violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) could have a significant adverse effect on our business due to the disruption and distraction of an investigation, financial penalties and criminal penalties.Government regulations regarding the use of ""conflict"" minerals could adversely affect our prospects and results of operations.Regulatory requirements regarding the use of “conflict” minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries could affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of certain products. Although we do not buy raw materials, manufacture, or produce any electronic equipment using conflict minerals directly, the proposed regulation may affect some of our suppliers.  As a result, there may only be a limited pool of suppliers who provide conflict free metals, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices.  Also, because our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all metals used in the products that we sell.  Further, if we are unable to comply with the new laws or regulations or if our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us.  We may need to incur additional costs and invest additional resources, including management’s time, in order to comply with the new regulations and anticipated additional reporting and disclosure obligations.Our stock price may be volatile and, as a result, you may lose some or all of your investment.The stock prices of technology companies tend to fluctuate significantly.  We believe factors such as announcements of new products or services by us or our competitors and quarterly variations in financial results may cause the market price of our Common Stock to fluctuate substantially.  In addition, overall volatility in the stock market, particularly in the technology company sector, is often unrelated to the operating performance of companies.  If these market fluctuations continue in the future, they may adversely affect the price of our Common Stock.  Cyber security breaches or terrorism could result in liabilities or costs as well as damage to our data or customer access to our website and information systems.  The collection, storage, transmission, use and disclosure of user data and personal information could give rise to liabilities or additional costs as a result of laws, governmental regulations and evolving views of personal privacy rights.  Cyber security breaches or terrorism could result in the exposure or theft of private or confidential information as well as interrupt our business, including denying customer access to our website and information systems.  We transmit, and in some cases store, end-user data, including personal information.  In jurisdictions around the world, personal information is becoming increasingly subject to legislation and regulations intended to protect consumers’ privacy and security.  The interpretation of privacy and data protection laws and regulations regarding the collection, storage, transmission, use and disclosure of such information in some jurisdictions is unclear and evolving.  These laws may be interpreted and applied in conflicting ways from country to country and in a manner that is not consistent with our current data protection practices.  Complying with these varying international requirements could cause us to incur additional costs and change our business practices.  Because our services are accessible in many foreign jurisdictions, some of these jurisdictions may claim that we are required to comply with their laws, even where we have no local entity, employees or infrastructure.  We could be forced to incur significant expenses if we were required to modify our products, our services or our existing security and privacy procedures in order to comply with new or expanded regulations.15   "
9,DAIO,DATA I/O CORP,2012-03-28,"  Risk Factors
 Cautionary Factors That May Affect Future Results Data I/O’s disclosure and analysis in this Annual Report contains some forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements include our current expectations or forecasts of future events.  The reader can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.  In particular, these include statements relating to future action, prospective products, new technologies, establishing foreign operations, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, outsourcing of functions, outcome of contingencies, impact of regulatory requirements, restructure actions and financial results.Any or all of the forward-looking statements in this Annual Report or in any other public statement made may turn out to be wrong.  They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make, or known or unknown risks and uncertainties can affect these forward-looking statements.  Many factors -- for example, product competition and product development -- will be important in determining future results.  Moreover, neither Data I/O nor anyone else assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of these forward-looking statements.  Actual future results may materially vary.We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements after the date of this Annual Report, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  The reader should not unduly rely on our forward-looking statements.  The reader is advised, however, to consult any future disclosures Data I/O makes on related subjects in our 10-Q, 8-K and 10-K reports to the SEC and press releases.  Also, note that Data I/O provides the following cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and possible inaccurate assumptions relevant to our business.  These are factors that we think could cause Data I/O’s actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results.  Other factors besides those listed here could also adversely affect Data I/O.  This discussion is permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.RISK FACTORSA decline in economic and market conditions may result in decreased capital spending and delayed or defaulted payments from our customers.Our business is highly impacted by capital spending plans and other economic cycles that affect the users and manufacturers of integrated circuits.  These industries are highly cyclical and are characterized by rapid technological change, short product life cycles and fluctuations in manufacturing capacity and pricing and gross margin pressures.  As we experienced in recent years and are currently experiencing, our operations may in the future reflect substantial fluctuations from period-to-period as a consequence of these industry patterns, general economic conditions affecting the timing of orders from major customers, and other factors affecting capital spending.  In a difficult economic climate it may take us longer to receive payments from our customers and some of our customers’ business may fail, resulting in non-payment.  These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.Delays in development, introduction and shipment of new products or services may result in a decline in sales.Data I/O develops new engineering and automated programming systems and services.  Significant technological, supplier, manufacturing or other problems may delay the development, introduction or production of these products or services.For example, we may encounter these problems: ·         technical problems in the development of a new programming system platform or the robotics for new automated handing systems10 ·         inability to hire qualified personnel·         delays or failures to perform by third parties involved in our development projects·         development of new services that are not accepted by the marketDelays in the development, completion and shipment of new products or services, or customers not accepting new products, may result in a decline in sales.Quarterly fluctuations in our operating results may adversely affect our stock price.Data I/O’s operating results tend to vary from quarter to quarter.  Our revenue in each quarter substantially depends upon orders received within that quarter.  Conversely, our expenditures are based on investment plans and estimates of future revenues.  We may, therefore, be unable to quickly reduce our spending if our revenues decline in a given quarter.  As a result, operating results for that quarter will suffer.  Our results of operations for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future periods.Other factors, which may cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate, include:·         increased competition ·         timing of new product announcements and timing of development expenditures·         product or service releases and pricing changes by us or our competitors·         market acceptance or delays in the introduction of new products or services·         production constraints·         quality issues·         labor or material shortages (such as supply chain disruptions from the earthquake in Japan)·         the timing of significant orders·         the sales channel mix of direct vs. indirect distribution·         civil unrest, war or terrorism·         health issues (such as the outbreak of a virus)·         customers’ budgets·         adverse movements in exchange rates, interest rates or tax rates·         cyclical and seasonal nature of demand for our customers’ products·         general economic conditions in the countries where we sell products·         expenses and obtaining authorizations in setting up new operations or locationsDue to all of the foregoing factors, it is possible that in some future quarters, our operating results will be below expectations of analysts and investors.Failure to adapt to technology trends in our industry may hinder our competitiveness and financial results.Product and service technology in Data I/O’s industry evolves rapidly, making timely product innovation essential to success in the marketplace.  Introducing products and services with improved technologies or features may render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable.  Technological advances that may negatively impact our business include:  ·         new device package types, densities and technologies requiring hardware and software changes in order to be programmed by our products11 ·         electronics equipment manufacturing practices, such as widespread use of in-circuit programming·         customer software platform preferences different from those on which our products operate·         more rigid industry standards, which would decrease the value-added element of our products and support servicesIf we cannot develop products or services in a timely manner in response to industry changes, or if our products or services do not perform well, our business and financial condition may be adversely affected.  Also, our new products or services may contain defects or errors that give rise to product liability claims against us or cause our products to fail to gain market acceptance.  Our future success depends on our ability to successfully compete with other technology firms in attracting and retaining key technical personnel.We have a history of recent operating losses and may be unable to generate enough revenue to achieve and maintain profitability.We have incurred operating losses in one of the last five years and four of the last ten years.  We operate in a cyclical industry.  We will continue to examine our level of operating expense based upon our projected revenues.  Any planned increases in operating expenses may result in losses in future periods if projected revenues are not achieved.  As a result, we may need to generate greater revenues than we have recently to achieve and maintain profitability.  However, we cannot provide assurance that our revenues will increase and our strategy may not be successful, resulting in future losses.We may need to raise additional capital and our future access to capital is uncertain.Our past revenues have occasionally been, and our future revenues may again be insufficient to support the expense of our operations and any expansion of our business.  We may therefore need additional equity or debt capital to finance our operations.  If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or to obtain funds through additional debt or equity financing, we may have to reduce some or all of our development and sales and marketing efforts and limit the expansion of our business.  We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months.  Thereafter, depending on the development of our business, we may need to raise additional cash for working capital or other expenses.  We may also encounter opportunities for acquisitions or other business initiatives that require significant cash commitments, or unanticipated problems or expenses that could result in a requirement for additional cash before that time.Therefore, we may seek additional funding through public or private debt or equity financing or from other sources.  We have no commitments for additional financing, and given the current economic climate may experience difficulty in obtaining funding on favorable terms, if at all.  Any financing we obtain may contain covenants that restrict our freedom to operate our business or may require us to issue securities that have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our Common Stock and may dilute your ownership interest.We may face increased competition and may not be able to compete successfully with current and future competitors.Technological advances have reduced the barriers of entry into the programming systems market.  We expect competition to increase from both established and emerging companies.  If we fail to compete successfully against current and future sources of competition, our profitability and financial performance will be adversely impacted.If our relationship with semiconductor manufacturers deteriorates, our business may be adversely affected.  We work closely with most semiconductor manufacturers to ensure that our programming systems comply with their requirements.  In addition, many semiconductor manufacturers recommend our programming systems for use by users of their programmable devices.  These working relationships enable us to keep our programming systems product lines up to date and provide end-users with broad and current programmable device support.  Our business may be adversely affected if our relationships with semiconductor manufacturers deteriorate.Our reliance on a small number of suppliers may result in a shortage of key components, which may adversely affect our business, and our suppliers may experience financial difficulties which could effect their ability to service Data I/O’s needs.Certain parts used in our products are currently available from either a single supplier or from a limited number of suppliers.  If we cannot develop alternative sources of these components, if sales of parts are discontinued by the supplier, if we experience deterioration 12 in our relationship with these suppliers, or if these suppliers require financing which is not available there may be delays or reductions in product introductions or shipments, which may materially adversely affect our operating results.Because we rely on a small number of suppliers for certain parts, we are subject to possible price increases by these suppliers.  Also, we may be unable to accurately forecast our production schedule.  If we underestimate our production schedule, suppliers may be unable to meet our demand for components.  This delay in the supply of key components may materially adversely affect our business.  Over estimation of demand will lead to excess inventories that may become obsolete.Certain of our programming system products are currently manufactured to our specifications by a third-party foreign contract manufacturers.  We may not be able to obtain a sufficient quantity of these products if and when needed, which may result in lost sales.If we are unable to attract and retain qualified third-party distributors and representatives, our business may be adversely affected.Data I/O has an internal sales force and also utilizes third-party distributors and representatives.  Therefore, the financial stability of these distributors and representatives is important.  Their ability to timely pay Data I/O and to acquire any necessary financing may be affected by the current economic climate.  Highly skilled professional engineers use most of our products.  To be effective, third-party distributors and representatives must possess significant technical, marketing and sales resources and must devote their resources to sales efforts, customer education, training and support.  These required qualities limit the number of potential third-party distributors and representatives.  Our business will suffer if we cannot attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified third-party distributors and representatives to market our products.Our international operations may expose us to additional risks that may adversely affect our business.International sales represented approximately 90%, 88% and 88% of our net revenue for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.  We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of our net revenue.  International sales may fluctuate due to various factors, including:·         migration of manufacturing to low cost geographies·         unexpected changes in regulatory requirements·         tariffs and taxes·         difficulties in establishing, staffing and managing foreign operations·         longer average payment cycles and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable·         fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates ·         compliance with applicable export licensing requirements·         product safety and other certification requirements·         difficulties in integrating foreign and outsourced operations·         civil unrest, political and economic instabilityBecause we have customers located throughout the world, we have significant foreign receivables.  We may experience difficulties in collecting these amounts as a result of payment practices of certain foreign customers, the availability and reliability of foreign credit information, and potential difficulties in enforcing collection terms.  The European Community and European Free Trade Association (“EU”) has established certain electronic emission and product safety requirements (“CE”).  As applicable, our products currently meet these requirements, however, failure to obtain either a CE certification or a waiver for any product may prevent us from marketing that product in Europe.  The EU also has directives concerning the Reduction of Hazardous Substances (“RoHS”) from which Data I/O is relying on an exemption for test and measurement companies.  China is implementing similar requirements.  Failure to meet applicable directives or qualifying exemptions may prevent us from marketing certain products in Europe or other territories with similar requirements.    13 We have subsidiaries in Germany, China, Hong Kong, Brazil and Canada.  Our business and financial condition is sensitive to currency exchange rates or any other restrictions imposed on their currencies.  Currency exchange fluctuations in these countries may adversely affect our investment in our subsidiaries.If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, we may not be able to compete effectively or operate profitably. Data I/O relies on patents, copyrights, trade secrets and trademarks to protect our intellectual property, as well as product development and marketing skill to establish and protect our market position.  We attempt to protect our rights in proprietary software products, including TaskLink, our intellectual property software, and other software products by retaining the title to and copyright of the software and documentation, by including appropriate contractual restrictions on use and disclosure in our licenses, and by requiring our employees to execute non-disclosure agreements. Because of the rapidly changing technology in the semiconductor, electronic equipment and software industries, portions of our products might possibly infringe upon existing patents or copyrights, and we may be required to obtain licenses or discontinue the use of the infringing technology.  We believe that any exposure we may have regarding possible infringement claims is a reasonable business risk similar to that assumed by other companies in the electronic equipment and software industries.  However, any claim of infringement, with or without merit, could be costly and a diversion of management’s attention, and an adverse determination could adversely affect our reputation, preclude us from offering certain products, and subject us to substantial liability. We may pursue business acquisitions that could impair our financial position and profitability.We may pursue acquisitions of complementary technologies, product lines or businesses.  Future acquisitions may include risks, such as:·         burdening management and our operating teams during the integration of the acquired entity·         diverting management’s attention from other business concerns·         failing to successfully integrate the acquired products·         lack of acceptance of the acquired products by our sales channels or customers·         entering markets where we have no or limited prior experience·         potential loss of key employees of the acquired company·         additional burden of support for an acquired programmer architectureFuture acquisitions may also impact Data I/O’s financial position.  For example, we may use significant cash or incur additional debt, which would weaken our balance sheet.  We may also capitalize goodwill and intangible assets acquired, the impairment of which would reduce our profitability.  We cannot guarantee that future acquisitions will improve our business or operating results.The loss of key employees may adversely affect our operations. We have employees located in the U.S., Germany and China.  We also utilize independent contractors for specialty work, primarily in research and development, and utilize temporary workers to adjust capacity to fluctuating demand.  Many of our employees are highly skilled and our continued success will depend in part upon our ability to attract and retain employees who can be in great demand within the industry.  None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit and we believe relations with our employees are favorable, though no assurance can be made that this will be the case in the future.  In China, our workers are “leased” with the arrangements made under the Shanghai Foreign Services Co., Ltd.  (“FSCO”) labor agreement and we could be adversely affected if we were unable to continue that arrangement.Our Chief Executive Officer succession plan implementation, search process and transition involves significant costs and risks that may adversely affect our business. Mr. Hume, Data I/O’s Chief Executive Officer or CEO, announced his planned retirement by the end of 2012. We are implementing our CEO succession plan.  Our ability to select, attract and hire a new CEO may prove difficult, take more time than anticipated, and be costly.  This may require other senior management to divert part of their attention from their primary duties, which could have a material adverse effect on  14 our business or operations.  In addition, the new CEO transition could be disruptive to the organization, business plans, and retention of other team members. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements may adversely affect our stock price and business.As a public company, we are subject to numerous governmental and stock exchange requirements, with which we believe we are in compliance.  Our failure to meet regulatory requirements and exchange listing standards may result in actions such as: the delisting of our stock, impacting our stock’s liquidity; SEC enforcement actions; and securities claims and litigation.The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have requirements that we may fail to meet by the required deadlines or we may fall out of compliance with, such as the internal controls auditor attestation required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, with which we are not currently required to comply as we are a smaller reporting company.  Data I/O assumes it will continue to have the status of a smaller reporting company based on the aggregate market value of the voting and non-voting shares held as of June 30, 2011.  If we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  Moreover, effective internal controls, particularly those related to revenue recognition, are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent financial fraud.  If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our stock could drop significantly.  While we have policies and procedures in place designed to prevent corruption and bribery, because our business is 90% international, violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) could have a significant adverse effect on our business due to the disruption and distraction of an investigation, financial penalties and criminal penalties.Government regulations regarding the use of ""conflict"" minerals could adversely affect our prospects and results of operations.Proposed regulatory developments regarding the use of “conflict” minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries could affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of certain products. Although we do not buy raw materials, manufacture, or produce any electronic equipment using conflict minerals directly, the proposed regulation may affect some of our suppliers.  As a result, there may only be a limited pool of suppliers who provide conflict free metals, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices.  Also, because our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all metals used in the products that we sell.  Further, if we are unable to comply with the new laws or regulations or if our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us.  We may need to incur additional costs and invest additional resources, including management’s time, in order to comply with the new regulations and anticipated additional reporting and disclosure obligations.Our stock price may be volatile and, as a result, you may lose some or all of your investment.The stock prices of technology companies tend to fluctuate significantly.  We believe factors such as announcements of new products or services by us or our competitors and quarterly variations in financial results may cause the market price of Data I/O’s Common Stock to fluctuate substantially.  In addition, overall volatility in the stock market, particularly in the technology company sector, is often unrelated to the operating performance of companies.  If these market fluctuations continue in the future, they may adversely affect the price of Data I/O’s Common Stock.  Cyber security breaches or terrorism could result in liabilities or costs as well damage to our data or customer access to our website and information systems.  The collection, storage, transmission, use and disclosure of user data and personal information could give rise to liabilities or additional costs as a result of laws, governmental regulations and evolving views of personal privacy rights.  Cyber security breaches or terrorism could result in the exposure or theft of private or confidential information as well as interrupt our business, including denying customer access to website and our information systems. We transmit, and in some cases store, end-user data, including personal information. In jurisdictions around the world, personal information is becoming increasingly subject to legislation and regulations intended to protect consumers’ privacy and security. The interpretation of privacy and data protection laws and regulations regarding the collection, storage, transmission, use and disclosure of such information in some jurisdictions is unclear and evolving.  15 These laws may be interpreted and applied in conflicting ways from country to country and in a manner that is not consistent with our current data protection practices. Complying with these varying international requirements could cause us to incur additional costs and change our business practices. Because our services are accessible in many foreign jurisdictions, some of these jurisdictions may claim that we are required to comply with their laws, even where we have no local entity, employees or infrastructure. We could be forced to incur significant expenses if we were required to modify our products, our services or our existing security and privacy procedures in order to comply with new or expanded regulations. "

 Cautionary Factors That May Affect Future Results Data I/Os disclosure and analysis in this Annual Report contains some forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements include our current expectations or forecasts of future events.  The reader can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts.  In particular, these include statements relating to future action, prospective products, new technologies, establishing foreign operations, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, outsourcing of functions, outcome of contingencies, impact of regulatory requirements, restructure actions and financial results.Any or all of the forward-looking statements in this Annual Report or in any other public statement made may turn out to be wrong.  They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make, or known or unknown risks and uncertainties can affect these forward-looking statements.  Many factors -- for example, product competition and product development -- will be important in determining future results.  Moreover, neither Data I/O nor anyone else assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of these forward-looking statements.  Actual future results may materially vary.We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements after the date of this Annual Report, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.  The reader should not unduly rely on our forward-looking statements.  The reader is advised, however, to consult any future disclosures Data I/O makes on related subjects in our 10-Q, 8-K and 10-K reports to the SEC and press releases.  Also, note that Data I/O provides the following cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and possible inaccurate assumptions relevant to our business.  These are factors that we think could cause Data I/Os actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results.  Other factors besides those listed here could also adversely affect Data I/O.  This discussion is permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of  Reform Act of 1995.                                                                                                         10   RISK FACTORSA decline in economic and market conditions may result in decreased capital spending and delayed or defaulted payments from our customers.Our business is highly impacted by capital spending plans and other economic cycles that affect the users and manufacturers of integrated circuits.  These industries are highly cyclical and are characterized by rapid technological change, short product life cycles, and fluctuations in manufacturing capacity and pricing and gross margin pressures.  As we experienced in recent years and are currently experiencing, our operations may in the future reflect substantial fluctuations from period-to-period as a consequence of these industry patterns, general economic conditions affecting the timing of orders from major customers, and other factors affecting capital spending.  In a difficult economic climate it may take us longer to receive payments from our customers and some of our customers business may fail, resulting in non-payment.  These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.Delays in development, introduction and shipment of new products or services may result in a decline in sales.Data I/O develops new engineering and automated programming systems and services.  Significant technological, supplier, manufacturing or other problems may delay the development, introduction or production of these products or services.For example, we may encounter these problems: ·         technical problems in the development of a new programming system platform or the robotics for new automated handing systems·         inability to hire qualified personnel·         delays or failures to perform by third parties involved in our development projects·         development of new services that are not accepted by the marketDelays in the development, completion and shipment of new products or services, or customers not accepting new products, may result in a decline in sales.Quarterly fluctuations in our operating results may adversely affect our stock price.Data I/Os operating results tend to vary from quarter to quarter.  Our revenue in each quarter substantially depends upon orders received within that quarter.  Conversely, our expenditures are based on investment plans and estimates of future revenues.  We may, therefore, be unable to quickly reduce our spending if our revenues decline in a given quarter.  As a result, operating results for that quarter will suffer.  Our results of operations for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future periods.Other factors, which may cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate, include:·         increased competition ·         timing of new product announcements·         product or service releases and pricing changes by us or our competitors·         market acceptance or delays in the introduction of new products or services·         production constraints·         quality issues·         labor or material shortages (such as supply chain disruptions from the earthquake in Japan)·         the timing of significant orders·         the sales channel mix of direct vs. indirect distribution·         civil unrest, war or terrorism                                                                                                      11   ·         health issues (such as the H1N1 virus)·         customers budgets·         adverse movements in exchange rates, interest rates or tax rates·         cyclical nature of demand for our customers products·         general economic conditions in the countries where we sell products·         expenses and obtaining authorizations in setting up new operations or locationsDue to all of the foregoing factors, it is possible that in some future quarters, our operating results will be below expectations of analysts and investors.Failure to adapt to technology trends in our industry may hinder our competitiveness and financial results.Product and service technology in Data I/Os industry evolves rapidly, making timely product innovation essential to success in the marketplace.  Introducing products and services with improved technologies or features may render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable.  Technological advances that may negatively impact our business include:  ·         new device package types, densities, and technologies requiring hardware and software changes in order to be programmed by our products·         electronics equipment manufacturing practices, such as widespread use of in-circuit programming·         customer software platform preferences different from those on which our products operate·         more rigid industry standards, which would decrease the value-added element of our products and support servicesIf we cannot develop products or services in a timely manner in response to industry changes, or if our products or services do not perform well, our business and financial condition may be adversely affected.  Also, our new products or services may contain defects or errors that give rise to product liability claims against us or cause our products to fail to gain market acceptance.  Our future success depends on our ability to successfully compete with other technology firms in attracting and retaining key technical personnel.We have a history of recent operating losses and may be unable to generate enough revenue to achieve and maintain profitability.We have incurred operating losses in two of the last five years and five of the last ten years.  We will continue to examine our level of operating expense based upon our projected revenues.  Any planned increases in operating expenses may result in losses in future periods if projected revenues are not achieved.  As a result, we may need to generate greater revenues than we have recently to achieve and maintain profitability.  However, we cannot provide assurance that our revenues will increase and our strategy may not be successful, resulting in future losses.We may need to raise additional capital and our future access to capital is uncertain.Our past revenues have occasionally been, and our future revenues may again be insufficient to support the expense of our operations and any expansion of our business.  We may therefore need additional equity or debt capital to finance our operations.  If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or to obtain funds through additional debt or equity financing, we may have to reduce some or all of our development and sales and marketing efforts and limit the expansion of our business.  We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months.  Thereafter, depending on the development of our business, we may need to raise additional cash for working capital or other expenses.  We may also encounter opportunities for acquisitions or other business initiatives that require significant cash commitments, or unanticipated problems or expenses that could result in a requirement for additional cash before that time.Therefore, we may seek additional funding through public or private debt or equity financing or from other sources.  We have no commitments for additional financing, and given the current economic climate may experience difficulty in obtaining funding on favorable terms, if at all.  Any financing we obtain may contain covenants that restrict our freedom to operate our business or may require us to issue securities that have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our Common Stock and may dilute your ownership interest                                                                                                      12   We may face increased competition and may not be able to compete successfully with current and future competitors.Technological advances have reduced the barriers of entry into the programming systems market.  We expect competition to increase from both established and emerging companies.  If we fail to compete successfully against current and future sources of competition, our profitability and financial performance will be adversely impacted.If our relationship with semiconductor manufacturers deteriorates, our business may be adversely affected. We work closely with most semiconductor manufacturers to ensure that our programming systems comply with their requirements.  In addition, many semiconductor manufacturers recommend our programming systems for use by users of their programmable devices.  These working relationships enable us to keep our programming systems product lines up to date and provide end-users with broad and current programmable device support.  Our business may be adversely affected if our relationships with semiconductor manufacturers deteriorate.Our reliance on a small number of suppliers may result in a shortage of key components, which may adversely affect our business, and our suppliers may experience financial difficulties which could effect their ability to service Data I/Os needs.Certain parts used in our products are currently available from either a single supplier or from a limited number of suppliers.  If we cannot develop alternative sources of these components, if sales of parts are discontinued by the supplier, if we experience deterioration in our relationship with these suppliers, or if these suppliers require financing which is not available there may be delays or reductions in product introductions or shipments, which may materially adversely affect our operating results.Because we rely on a small number of suppliers for certain parts, we are subject to possible price increases by these suppliers.  Also, we may be unable to accurately forecast our production schedule.  If we underestimate our production schedule, suppliers may be unable to meet our demand for components.  This delay in the supply of key components may materially adversely affect our business.  Over estimation of demand will lead to excess inventories that may become obsolete.The non-automated programming system products we acquired with our acquisition of SMS in November 1998 are currently manufactured to our specifications by a third-party foreign contract manufacturer.  We may not be able to obtain a sufficient quantity of these products if and when needed, which may result in lost sales.If we are unable to attract and retain qualified third-party distributors and representatives, our business may be adversely affected.Data I/O has an internal sales force and also utilizes third-party distributors and representatives.  Therefore, the financial stability of these distributors and representatives is important.  Their ability to timely pay Data I/O and to acquire any necessary financing may be affected by the current economic climate.  Highly skilled professional engineers use most of our products.  To be effective, third-party distributors and representatives must possess significant technical, marketing and sales resources and must devote their resources to sales efforts, customer education, training and support.  These required qualities limit the number of potential third-party distributors and representatives.  Our business will suffer if we cannot attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified third-party distributors and representatives to market our products.Our international operations may expose us to additional risks that may adversely affect our business.International sales represented 88%, 88% and 85% of our net revenue for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2010, December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively.  We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of our net revenue.  International sales may fluctuate due to various factors, including:·         migration of manufacturing to low cost geographies·         unexpected changes in regulatory requirements·         tariffs and taxes·         difficulties in establishing, staffing and managing foreign operations·         longer average payment cycles and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable·         fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates ·         compliance with applicable export licensing requirements                                                                                                13   ·         product safety and other certification requirements·         difficulties in integrating foreign and outsourced operations·         civil unrest, political and economic instabilityBecause we have customers located throughout the world, we have significant foreign receivables.  We may experience difficulties in collecting these amounts as a result of payment practices of certain foreign customers, the availability and reliability of foreign credit information, and potential difficulties in enforcing collection terms.  The European Community and European Free Trade Association (EU) has established certain electronic emission and product safety requirements (CE).  Although our products currently meet these requirements, failure to obtain either a CE certification or a waiver for any product may prevent us from marketing that product in Europe.  The EU also has directives concerning the Reduction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) from which Data I/O is relying on an exemption for test and measurement companies.  China is implementing similar requirements.  Failure to meet applicable directives or qualifying exemptions may prevent us from marketing certain products in Europe or other territories with similar requirements.  We have subsidiaries in Germany, China, Hong Kong, Brazil, and Canada.  Our business and financial condition is sensitive to currency exchange rates or any other restrictions imposed on their currencies.  Currency exchange fluctuations in these countries may adversely affect our investment in our subsidiaries.If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, we may not be able to compete effectively or operate profitably. Data I/O relies on patents, copyrights, trade secrets and trademarks to protect our intellectual property, as well as product development and marketing skill to establish and protect our market position.  We attempt to protect our rights in proprietary software products, including TaskLink, our intellectual property software, and other software products by retaining the title to and copyright of the software and documentation, by including appropriate contractual restrictions on use and disclosure in our licenses, and by requiring our employees to execute non-disclosure agreements. Because of the rapidly changing technology in the semiconductor, electronic equipment and software industries, portions of our products might possibly infringe upon existing patents or copyrights, and we may be required to obtain licenses or discontinue the use of the infringing technology.  We believe that any exposure we may have regarding possible infringement claims is a reasonable business risk similar to that assumed by other companies in the electronic equipment and software industries.  However, any claim of infringement, with or without merit, could be costly and a diversion of managements attention, and an adverse determination could adversely affect our reputation, preclude us from offering certain products, and subject us to substantial liability. We may pursue business acquisitions that could impair our financial position and profitability.We may pursue acquisitions of complementary technologies, product lines or businesses.  Future acquisitions may include risks, such as:·         burdening management and our operating teams during the integration of the acquired entity·         diverting managements attention from other business concerns·         failing to successfully integrate the acquired products·         lack of acceptance of the acquired products by our sales channels or customers·         entering markets where we have no or limited prior experience·         potential loss of key employees of the acquired company·         additional burden of support for an acquired programmer architectureFuture acquisitions may also impact Data I/Os financial position.  For example, we may use significant cash or incur additional debt, which would weaken our balance sheet.  We may also capitalize goodwill and intangible assets acquired, the impairment of which would reduce our profitability.  We cannot guarantee that future acquisitions will improve our business or operating results.                                                                                                        14   The loss of key employees may adversely affect our operations. We have employees located in the U.S., Germany, and China.  We also utilize independent contractors for specialty work, primarily in research and development, and utilize temporary workers to adjust capacity to fluctuating demand.  Many of our employees are highly skilled and our continued success will depend in part upon our ability to attract and retain employees who can be in great demand within the industry.  None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit and we believe relations with our employees are favorable, though no assurance can be made that this will be the case in the future.  In China, our workers are leased with the arrangements made under the Shanghai Foreign Services Co., Ltd.  (FSCO) labor agreement and we could be adversely affected if we were unable to continue that arrangement.   Failure to comply with regulatory requirements may adversely affect our stock price and business.As a public company, we are subject to numerous governmental and stock exchange requirements, with which we believe we are in compliance.  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have requirements that we may fail to meet by the required deadlines or we may fall out of compliance with, such as the internal controls auditor attestation required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, with which we are not currently required to comply as we are a smaller reporting company.  Data I/O assumes it will continue to have the status of a smaller reporting company based on the aggregate market value of the voting and non-voting shares held as of June 30, 2010.  If we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  Moreover, effective internal controls, particularly those related to revenue recognition, are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent financial fraud.  If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our stock could drop significantly.  Our failure to meet regulatory requirements and exchange listing standards may result in actions such as: the delisting of our stock, impacting our stocks liquidity; SEC enforcement actions; and securities claims and litigation.  Regulatory and other requirements related to climate change may impact certain of our customers which might impact the demand for certain of our products.Government regulations regarding the use of ""conflict"" minerals could adversely affect our prospects and results of operations.Proposed regulatory developments regarding the use of conflict minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries could affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of certain products. Although we do not buy raw materials, manufacture, or produce any electronic equipment using conflict minerals directly, the proposed regulation may affect some of our suppliers. As a result, there may only be a limited pool of suppliers who provide conflict free metals, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain products in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, because our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges with our customers and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all metals used in the products that we sell.Our stock price may be volatile and, as a result, you may lose some or all of your investment.The stock prices of technology companies tend to fluctuate significantly.  We believe factors such as announcements of new products or services by us or our competitors and quarterly variations in financial results may cause the market price of Data I/Os Common Stock to fluctuate substantially.  In addition, overall volatility in the stock market, particularly in the technology company sector, is often unrelated to the operating performance of companies.  If these market fluctuations continue in the future, they may adversely affect the price of Data I/Os Common Stock"

fail, resulting in non-payment.  These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.Delays in development, introduction and shipment of new products or services may result in a decline in sales.Data I/O develops new engineering and automated programming systems and services.  Significant technological, supplier, manufacturing or other problems may delay the development, introduction or production of these products or services.For example, we may encounter these problems: ·              technical problems in the development of a new programming system platform or the robotics for new automated handing systems·              inability to hire qualified personnel·              delays or failures to perform by third parties involved in our development projects·              development of new services that are not accepted by the marketDelays in the development, completion and shipment of new products or services, or failure of customers to accept new products, may result in a decline in sales.Quarterly fluctuations in our operating results may adversely affect our stock price.Data I/Os operating results tend to vary from quarter to quarter.  Our revenue in each quarter substantially depends upon orders received within that quarter.  Conversely, our expenditures are based on investment plans and estimates of future revenues.  We may, therefore, be unable to quickly reduce our spending if our revenues decline in a given quarter.  As a result, operating results for that quarter will suffer.  Our results of operations for any one

defects or errors that give rise to product liability claims against us or cause our products to fail to gain market acceptance.  Our future success depends on our ability to successfully compete with other technology firms in attracting and retaining key technical personnel.We have a history of recent operating losses and may be unable to generate enough revenue to achieve and maintain profitability.We have incurred operating losses in two of the last five years.  We will continue to examine our level of operating expense based upon our projected revenues.  Any planned increases in operating expenses may result in larger losses in future periods if projected revenues are not achieved.  As a result, we may need to generate greater revenues than we have recently to achieve and maintain profitability.  However, we cannot provide assurance that our revenues will increase and our strategy may not be successful, resulting in future losses.Our restructuring activities may have a negative impact on our future operations.Our restructuring plans may yield unanticipated consequences, such as increased burden on our administrative, operational, and financial resources and increased responsibilities for our management personnel.  As a result, our ability to respond to unexpected challenges may be impaired and we may be unable to take advantage of new opportunities.In addition, many of the employees that were terminated as a part of our restructuring possessed specific knowledge or expertise, and that knowledge or expertise may prove to have been important to our operations.  In that case, their absence may create significant difficulties, particularly if our business experiences significant growth.  Also, the reduction in workforce related to our restructuring may subject us to the risk of litigation, which could result in substantial cost.  Any failure by us to properly manage this rapid change in workforce could impair our ability to efficiently manage our business, to maintain and develop important relationships with third-parties, and to attract and retain customers.  It could also cause us to incur higher operating cost and delays in the execution of our business plan or in the reporting or tracking of our financial results.We may need to raise additional capital and our future access to capital is uncertain.Our past revenues have been and our future revenues may continue to be insufficient to support the expense of our operations and any expansion of our business.  We may therefore need additional equity or debt capital to finance our operations.  If we are  unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or to obtain funds through additional debt or equity financing, we may have to reduce some or all of our development and sales and marketing efforts and limit the expansion of our business.                                                                                                                                                   &nbsp;                                                                                                                                                                         12 We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months.  Thereafter, depending on the development of our business, we may need to raise additional cash for working capital or other expenses.  We may also encounter opportunities for acquisitions or other business initiatives that require significant cash commitments, or unanticipated problems or expenses that could result in a requirement for additional cash before that time.Therefore, we may seek additional funding through public or private debt or equity financing or from other sources.  We have no commitments for additional financing, and given the current economic climate may experience difficulty in obtaining funding on favorable terms, if at all.  Any financing we obtain may contain covenants that restrict our freedom to operate our business or may require us to issue securities that have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our Common Stock and may dilute your ownership interest.We may face increased competition and may not be able to compete successfully with current and future competitors.Technological advances have reduced the barriers of entry into the programming systems market.  We expect competition to increase from both established and emerging companies.  If we fail to compete successfully against current and future sources of competition, our profitability and financial performance will be adversely impacted.If our relationship with semiconductor manufacturers deteriorates, our business may be adversely affected.We work closely with most semiconductor manufacturers to ensure that our programming systems comply with their requirements.  In addition, many semiconductor manufacturers recommend our programming systems for use by users of their programmable devices.  These working relationships enable us to keep our programming systems product lines up to date and provide end-users with broad and current programmable device support.  Our business may be adversely affected if our relationships with semiconductor manufacturers deteriorate.Our reliance on a small number of suppliers may result in a shortage of key components, which may adversely affect our business, and our suppliers may experience financial difficulties which could effect their ability to service Data I/Os needs.Certain parts used in our products are currently available from either a single supplier or from a limited number of suppliers.  If we cannot develop alternative sources of these components, if sales of parts are discontinued by the supplier, if we experience deterioration in our relationship with these suppliers, or if these suppliers require financing which is not available there may be delays or reductions in product introductions or shipments, which may materially adversely affect our operating results.Because we rely on a small number of suppliers for certain parts, we are subject to possible price increases by these suppliers.  Also, we may be unable to accurately forecast our production schedule.  If we underestimate our production schedule, suppliers may be unable to meet our demand for components.  This delay in the supply of key components may materially adversely affect our business.  Over estimation of demand will lead to excess inventories that may become obsolete.The non-automated programming system products we acquired with our acquisition of SMS in November 1998 are currently manufactured to our specifications by a third-party foreign contract manufacturer.  We may not be able to obtain a sufficient quantity of these products if and when needed, which may result in lost sales.If we are unable to attract and retain qualified third-party distributors and representatives, our business may be adversely affected.Data I/O has an internal sales force and also utilizes third-party distributors and representatives.  Therefore, the financial stability of these distributors and representatives is important.  Their ability to timely pay Data I/O and to acquire any necessary financing may be affected by the current economic climate.  Highly skilled professional engineers use most of our products.  To be effective, third-party distributors and representatives must possess significant technical, marketing and sales resources and must devote their resources to sales efforts, customer education, training and support.  These required qualities limit the number of potential third-party distributors and representatives.  Our business will suffer if we cannot attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified third-party distributors and representatives to market our products.                                                                                                                                                  &nbsp;                                                                                                                                                                         13 Our international operations may expose us to additional risks that may adversely affect our business. International sales represented 88% and 85% of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively.  We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of our net revenue.  International sales may fluctuate due to various factors, including:·              migration of manufacturing to low cost geographies·              unexpected changes in regulatory requirements·              tariffs and taxes·              difficulties in establishing, staffing and managing foreign operations·              longer average payment cycles and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable·              fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates ·              compliance with applicable export licensing requirements·              product safety and other certification requirements·              difficulties in integrating foreign and outsourced operations·              political and economic instabilityBecause we have customers located throughout the world, we have significant foreign receivables.  We may experience difficulties in collecting these amounts as a result of payment practices of certain foreign customers, the availability and reliability of foreign credit information, and potential difficulties in enforcing collection terms.  The European Community and European Free Trade Association (EU) has established certain electronic emission and product safety requirements (CE).  Although our products currently meet these requirements, failure to obtain either a CE certification or a waiver for any product may prevent us from marketing that product in Europe.  The EU also has directives concerning the Reduction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) from which Data I/O is relying on an exemption for test and measurement companies.  China is implementing similar requirements.  Failure to meet applicable directives or qualifying exemptions may prevent us from marketing certain products in Europe or other territories with similar requirements.  We have subsidiaries in Germany, China, Hong Kong, Brazil, and Canada.  Our business and financial condition is sensitive to currency exchange rates or any other restrictions imposed on their currencies.  Currency exchange fluctuations in these countries may adversely affect our investment in our subsidiaries.If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, we may not be able to compete effectively or operate profitably. Data I/O relies on patents, copyrights, trade secrets and trademarks to protect our intellectual property, as well as product development and marketing skill to establish and protect our market position.  We attempt to protect our rights in proprietary software products, including TaskLink, our intellectual property software, and other software products by retaining the title to and copyright of the software and documentation, by including appropriate contractual restrictions on use and disclosure in our licenses, and by requiring our employees to execute non-disclosure agreements. Because of the rapidly changing technology in the semiconductor, electronic equipment and software industries, portions of our products might possibly infringe upon existing patents or copyrights, and we may be required to obtain licenses or discontinue the use of the infringing technology.  We believe that any exposure we may have regarding possible infringement claims is a reasonable business risk similar to that assumed by other companies in the electronic equipment and software industries.  However, any claim of infringement, with or without merit, could be costly and a diversion of managements attention, and an adverse determination could adversely affect our reputation, preclude us from offering certain products, and subject us to substantial liability.We may pursue business acquisitions that could impair our financial position and profitability.We may pursue acquisitions of complementary technologies, product lines or businesses.  Future acquisitions may include risks, such as:·              burdening management and our operating teams during the integration of the acquired entity                                                                                                                                                 &nbsp;                                                                                                                                                                         14 ·              diverting managements attention from other business concerns·              failing to successfully integrate the acquired products·              lack of acceptance of the acquired products by our sales channels or customers·              entering markets where we have no or limited prior experience·              potential loss of key employees of the acquired company·              additional burden of support for an acquired programmer architectureFuture acquisitions may also impact Data I/Os financial position.  For example, we may use significant cash or incur additional debt, which would weaken our balance sheet.  We may also capitalize goodwill and intangible assets acquired, the impairment of which would reduce our profitability.  We cannot guarantee that future acquisitions will improve our business or operating results.The loss of key employees may adversely affect our operations. We have employees located in the U.S., Germany, and China.  We also utilize independent contractors for specialty work, primarily in research and development, and utilize temporary workers to adjust capacity to fluctuating demand.  Many of our employees are highly skilled and our continued success will depend in part upon our ability to attract and retain employees who can be in great demand within the industry.  None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit and we believe relations with our employees are favorable though no assurance can be made that this will be the case in the future.  In China, our workers are leased with the arrangements made under the Shanghai Foreign Services Co., Ltd.  (FSCO) labor agreement and we could be adversely affected if we were unable to continue that arrangement.  Refer to the section captioned Our restructuring activities may have a negative impact on our future operations above.   Failure to comply with regulatory requirements may adversely affect our stock price and business.As a public company, we are subject to numerous governmental and stock exchange requirements, with which we believe we are in compliance.  The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have requirements that we may fail to meet by the required deadlines or we may fall out of compliance with, such as the internal controls auditor attestation required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, with which we are not yet required to comply as we are not an accelerated filer.  Data I/O assumes it will continue to have the status of a smaller reporting company based on the aggregate market value of the voting and non-voting shares held as of June 30, 2009.  During the course of our testing we may identify deficiencies which we may not be able to remediate in time to meet the deadline imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 for compliance with the requirements of Section 404.  We may also incur additional costs in order to comply with Section 404.  In addition, if we fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.  Moreover, effective internal controls, particularly those related to revenue recognition, are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent financial fraud.  If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our stock could drop significantly.  Our failure to meet regulatory requirements and exchange listing standards may result in actions such as: the delisting of our stock, impacting our stocks liquidity; SEC enforcement actions; and securities claims and litigation.  Regulatory and other requirements related to climate change may impact certain of our customers which might impact the demand for certain of our products.Our stock price may be volatile and, as a result, you may lose some or all of your investment.The stock prices of technology companies tend to fluctuate significantly.  We believe factors such as announcements of new products or services by us or our competitors and quarterly variations in financial results may cause the market price of Data I/Os Common Stock to fluctuate substantially.  In addition, overall volatility in the stock market, particularly in the technology company sector, is often unrelated to the operating performance of companies.  If these market fluctuations continue in the future, they may adversely affect the price of Data I/Os Common Stock.                                                                                                                                                  &nbsp;

 Cautionary Factors That May Affect Future Results Data I/O’s disclosure and analysis in this Annual Report contains some forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include our current expectations or forecasts of future events. The reader can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. In particular, these include statements relating to future action, prospective            products, new technologies, establishing foreign operations, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, outsourcing of functions, outcome of contingencies, impact of regulatory requirements, restructure actions and financial results.Any or all of the forward-looking statements in this Annual Report or in any other public statement made may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make, or known or unknown risks and uncertainties can affect these forward-looking statements. Many factors -- for example, product competition and            product development -- will be important in determining future results. Moreover, neither Data I/O nor anyone else assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of these forward-looking statements. Actual future results may materially vary.We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements after the date of this Annual Report, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. The reader should not unduly rely on our forward-looking statements. The reader is advised, however, to consult any future disclosures Data I/O makes on related subjects in our 10-Q, 8-K and 10-K reports to the SEC            and press releases. Also, note that Data I/O provides the following cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and possible inaccurate assumptions relevant to our business. These are factors that we think could cause Data I/O’s actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. Other factors besides those listed here could also adversely affect Data I/O. This discussion is permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of            1995.RISK FACTORSA decline in economic and market conditions may result in decreased capital spending by delayed/non payments from our customers.Our business is highly impacted by capital spending plans and other economic cycles that affect the users and manufacturers of integrated circuits. These industries are highly cyclical and are characterized by rapid technological change, short product life cycles, and fluctuations in manufacturing capacity and pricing and gross margin pressures. As we experienced in recent years and are currently            experiencing, our operations may in the future reflect substantial fluctuations from period-to-period as a consequence of these industry patterns, general economic conditions affecting the timing of orders from major customers, and other factors affecting capital spending. In addition, in the current difficult economic climate it may take us longer to receive payments from our customers and some of our customers’ business may fail, resulting in non-payment. These factors could            have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.Delays in development, introduction and shipment of new products or services may result in a decline in sales.Data I/O develops new engineering and automated programming systems and services. Significant technological, supplier, manufacturing or other problems may delay the development, introduction or production of these products or services.For example, we may encounter these problems:•technical problems in the development of a new programming system platform or the robotics for new automated handing systems•inability to hire qualified personnel•delays or failures to perform by third parties involved in our development projects•development of new services that are not accepted by the marketDelays in the development, completion and shipment of new products or services, or failure of customers to accept new products, may result in a decline in sales.Quarterly fluctuations in our operating results may adversely affect our stock price.Data I/O’s operating results tend to vary from quarter to quarter. Our revenue in each quarter substantially depends upon orders received within that quarter. Conversely, our expenditures are based on investment plans and estimates of future revenues. We may, therefore, be unable to quickly reduce our spending if our revenues  10  decline in a given quarter. As a result, operating results for that quarter will suffer. Our results of operations for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future periods.Other factors, which may cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate, include:•increased competition•timing of new product announcements•product or service releases and pricing changes by us or our competitors•market acceptance or delays in the introduction of new products or services•production constraints•quality issues•labor or material shortages•the timing of significant orders•the sales channel mix of direct vs. indirect distribution•war or terrorism•health issues (such as SARS)•customers’ budgets•adverse movements in exchange rates, interest rates or tax rates•cyclical nature of demand for our customers’ products•general economic conditions in the countries where we sell products•expenses and obtaining authorizations in setting up new operations or locationsDue to all of the foregoing factors, it is possible that in some future quarters, our operating results will be below expectations of analysts and investors.Failure to adapt to technology trends in our industry may hinder our competitiveness and financial results.Product and service technology in Data I/O’s industry evolves rapidly, making timely product innovation essential to success in the marketplace. Introducing products and services with improved technologies or features may render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable. Technological advances that may negatively impact our business include:•new device package types, densities, and technologies requiring hardware and software changes in order to be programmed by our products•electronics equipment manufacturing practices, such as widespread use of in-circuit programming•customer software platform preferences different from those on which our products operate•more rigid industry standards, which would decrease the value-added element of our products and support servicesIf we cannot develop products or services in a timely manner in response to industry changes, or if our products or services do not perform well, our business and financial condition may be adversely affected. Also, our new products or services may contain defects or errors that give rise to product liability claims against us or cause our products to fail to gain market acceptance. Our future            success depends on our ability to successfully compete with other technology firms in attracting and retaining key technical personnel.We have a history of recent operating losses and may be unable to generate enough revenue to achieve and maintain profitability.We have incurred operating losses in two of the last five years. We will continue to examine our level of operating expense based upon our projected revenues. Any planned increases in operating expenses may result in larger losses in future periods if projected revenues are not achieved. As a result, we may need to generate greater revenues than we have recently to achieve and maintain profitability.            However, we cannot provide assurance that our revenues will increase and our strategy may not be successful, resulting in future losses.  11  Our restructuring activities may have a negative impact on our future operations.Our restructuring plans may yield unanticipated consequences, such as increased burden on our administrative, operational, and financial resources and increased responsibilities for our management personnel. As a result, our ability to respond to unexpected challenges may be impaired and we may be unable to take advantage of new opportunities.In addition, many of the employees that were terminated as a part of our restructuring possessed specific knowledge or expertise, and that knowledge or expertise may prove to have been important to our operations. In that case, their absence may create significant difficulties, particularly if our business experiences significant growth. Also, the reduction in workforce related to our restructuring            may subject us to the risk of litigation, which could result in substantial cost. Any failure by us to properly manage this rapid change in workforce could impair our ability to efficiently manage our business, to maintain and develop important relationships with third-parties, and to attract and retain customers. It could also cause us to incur higher operating cost and delays in the execution of our business plan or in the reporting or tracking of our financial results.We may need to raise additional capital and our future access to capital is uncertain.Our past revenues have been and our future revenues may continue to be insufficient to support the expense of our operations and any expansion of our business. We may therefore need additional equity or debt capital to finance our operations. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or to obtain funds through additional debt or equity financing, we may have to reduce some or            all of our development and sales and marketing efforts and limit the expansion of our business.We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months. Thereafter, depending on the development of our business, we may need to raise additional cash for working capital or other expenses. We may also encounter opportunities for acquisitions or other business initiatives that require significant cash            commitments, or unanticipated problems or expenses that could result in a requirement for additional cash before that time.Therefore, we may seek additional funding through public or private debt or equity financing or from other sources. We have no commitments for additional financing, and given the current economic climate may experience difficulty in obtaining funding on favorable terms, if at all. Any financing we obtain may contain covenants that restrict our freedom to operate our business or may require us to            issue securities that have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our Common Stock and may dilute your ownership interest.We may face increased competition and may not be able to compete successfully with current and future competitors.Technological advances have reduced the barriers of entry into the programming systems market. We expect competition to increase from both established and emerging companies. If we fail to compete successfully against current and future sources of competition, our profitability and financial performance will be adversely impacted.If our relationship with semiconductor manufacturers deteriorates, our business may be adversely affected.We work closely with most semiconductor manufacturers to ensure that our programming systems comply with their requirements. In addition, many semiconductor manufacturers recommend our programming systems for use by users of their programmable devices. These working relationships enable us to keep our programming systems product lines up to date and provide end-users with broad and current            programmable device support. Our business may be adversely affected if our relationships with semiconductor manufacturers deteriorate.Our reliance on a small number of suppliers may result in a shortage of key components, which may adversely affect our business, and our suppliers may experience financial difficulties which could effect their ability to service Data I/O’s needs.Certain parts used in our products are currently available from either a single supplier or from a limited number of suppliers. If we cannot develop alternative sources of these components, if sales of parts are discontinued by the supplier, if we experience deterioration in our relationship with these suppliers, or if these suppliers require financing which is not available there may be delays or            reductions in product introductions or shipments, which may materially adversely affect our operating results.Because we rely on a small number of suppliers for certain parts, we are subject to possible price increases by these suppliers. Also, we may be unable to accurately forecast our production schedule. If we underestimate our production schedule, suppliers may be unable to meet our demand for components. This delay in the supply of key components may materially adversely affect our business. Over            estimation of demand will lead to excess inventories that may become obsolete.  12  The non-automated programming system products we acquired when we acquired SMS in November 1998 are currently manufactured to our specifications by a third-party foreign contract manufacturer. We may not be able to obtain a sufficient quantity of these products if and when needed, which may result in lost sales.If we are unable to attract and retain qualified third-party distributors, our business may be adversely affected.Data I/O has an internal sales force and also utilizes third-party representatives, and distributors. Therefore, the financial stability of these representatives and distributors is important: Their ability to timely pay Data I/O and to acquire any necessary financing may be affected by the current economic climate. Highly skilled professional engineers use most of our products. To be effective,            third-party distributors must possess significant technical, marketing and sales resources and must devote their resources to sales efforts, customer education, training and support. These required qualities limit the number of potential third-party distributors. Our business will suffer if we cannot attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified third-party distributors to market our products.Our international operations may expose us to additional risks that may adversely affect our business.International sales represented 85% and 82% of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively. We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of our net revenue. International sales may fluctuate due to various factors, including:•migration of manufacturing to low cost geographies•unexpected changes in regulatory requirements•tariffs and taxes•difficulties in establishing, staffing and managing foreign operations•longer average payment cycles and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable•fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates•compliance with applicable export licensing requirements•product safety and other certification requirements•difficulties in integrating foreign and outsourced operations•political and economic instabilityBecause we have customers located throughout the world, we have significant foreign receivables. We may experience difficulties in collecting these amounts due to payment practices of certain foreign customers, the availability and reliability of foreign credit information, and potential difficulties in enforcing collection terms.The European Community and European Free Trade Association (“EU”) has established certain electronic emission and product safety requirements (“CE”). Although our products currently meet these requirements, failure to obtain either a CEcertification or a waiver for any product may prevent us from marketing that product in Europe. The EU also has directives concerning the            Reduction of Hazardous Substances (“RoHS”) from which Data I/O is relying on an exemption for test and measurement companies. China is implementing similar requirements. Failure to meet applicable directives or qualifying exemption may prevent us from marketing certain products in Europe or other territories with similar requirements.We have subsidiaries in Germany, China, Hong Kong, Brazil, and Canada. Our business and financial condition is sensitive to currency exchange rates or any other restrictions imposed on their currencies. Currency exchange fluctuations in Canada, China, Hong Kong, Brazil and Germany may adversely affect our investment in our subsidiaries.If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, we may not be able to compete effectively or operate profitably. Data I/O relies on patents, copyrights, trade secrets and trademarks to protect our intellectual property, as well as product development and marketing skill to establish and protect our market position. We attempt to protect our rights in proprietary software products, including TaskLink our intellectual property software and other software products, by retaining the title to and copyright of            the software and documentation, by including appropriate contractual restrictions on use and disclosure in our licenses, and by requiring our employees to execute non-disclosure agreements. Because of the rapidly changing technology in the semiconductor, electronic equipment and software industries, portions of our products might possibly infringe upon existing patents or copyrights, and we may be required to obtain licenses or discontinue the use of the infringing technology. We believe that any exposure we may have regarding possible infringement claims is a reasonable business risk            similar to that assumed by other companies  13   in the electronic equipment and software industries. However, any claim of infringement, with or without merit, could be costly and a diversion of management’s attention, and an adverse determination could adversely affect our reputation, preclude us from offering certain products, and subject us to substantial liability. We may pursue business acquisitions that could impair our financial position and profitability.We may pursue acquisitions of complementary technologies, product lines or businesses. Future acquisitions may include risks, such as:•burdening management and our operating teams during the integration of the acquired entity•diverting management’s attention from other business concerns•failing to successfully integrate the acquired products•lack of acceptance of the acquired products by our sales channels or customers•entering markets where we have no or limited prior experience•potential loss of key employees of the acquired company•additional burden of support for an acquired programmer architectureFuture acquisitions may also impact Data I/O’s financial position. For example, we may use significant cash or incur additional debt, which would weaken our balance sheet. We may also capitalize goodwill and intangible assets acquired, the impairment of which would reduce our profitability. We cannot guarantee that future acquisitions will improve our business or operating results.The loss of key employees may adversely affect our operations. We have employees located in the U.S., Germany, and China. We also utilize independent contractors for specialty work, primarily in research and development, and utilize temporary workers to adjust capacity to fluctuating demand. Many of our employees are highly skilled and our continued success will depend in part upon our ability to attract and retain employees who can be in great demand within the            industry. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit and we believe relations with our employees are favorable though no assurance can be made that this will be the case in the future. In China, our workers are “leased” with the arrangements made under the Shanghai Foreign Services Co., Ltd. (“FSCO”) labor agreement and we could be adversely affected if we were unable to continue that arrangement. Refer to the section            captioned “Our restructuring activities may have a negative impact on our future operations” above. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements may adversely affect our stock price and business.As a public company, we are subject to numerous governmental and stock exchange requirements, with which we believe we are in compliance. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have requirements that we may fail to meet by the required deadlines or we may fall out of compliance with, such as the internal controls auditor attestation required under Section 404            of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, with which we are not yet required to comply as we are not an accelerated filer.

Moreover,            effective internal controls, particularly those related to revenue recognition, are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent financial fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our stock could drop significantly. Our failure to meet regulatory requirements and            exchange listing standards may result in actions such as the delisting of our stock impacting our stock’s liquidity; SEC enforcement actions; and securities claims and litigation.Our stock price may be volatile and, as a result, you may lose some or all of your investment.The stock prices of technology companies tend to fluctuate significantly. We believe factors such as announcements of new products or services by us or our competitors and quarterly variations in financial results may cause the market price of Data I/O’s Common Stock to fluctuate substantially. In addition, overall volatility in the stock market, particularly in the technology company sector,            is often unrelated to the operating  14  performance of companies.

Cautionary Factors That May Affect Future Results Data        I/O’s disclosure and analysis in this Annual Report contains some forward-looking        statements. Forward-looking statements include our current expectations or forecasts of        future events. The reader can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate        strictly to historical or current facts. In particular, these include statements relating        to future action, prospective products, new technologies, establishing foreign operations,        future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses,        outsourcing of functions, outcome of contingencies, impact of regulatory requirements,        restructure actions and financial results.Any        or all of the forward-looking statements in this Annual Report or in any other public        statement made may turn out to be        wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we        might make, or known or unknown risks and uncertainties can affect these forward-looking        statements. Many factors -- for example, product competition and product development --        will be important in determining future results. Moreover, neither Data I/O nor anyone else        assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of these forward-looking        statements. Actual future results may materially vary.We        undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements after the date of        this Annual Report, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. The        reader should not place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. The reader is        advised, however, to consult any future disclosures Data I/O makes on related subjects in        our 10-Q, 8-K and 10-K reports to the SEC and press releases. Also, note that Data I/O        provides the following cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and possible        inaccurate assumptions relevant to our business. These are factors that we think could        cause Data I/O’s actual results to differ materially from expected and historical        results. Other factors besides those listed here could also adversely affect Data I/O. This        discussion is permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of        1995.RISK        FACTORSDelays        in development, introduction and shipment of new products or services may result in a        decline in sales.Data I/O        develops new engineering and automated programming systems and services. Significant        technological, supplier, manufacturing or other problems may delay the development,        introduction or production of these products or services.For example, we may encounter these problems:•technical problems in the development of a new programming                    system platform or the robotics for new automated handing systems•inability to hire qualified personnel•delays or failures to perform by third parties involved in our                    development projects•development of new services that are not accepted by the                    marketDelays        in the development, completion and shipment of new products or services, or failure of        customers to accept new products, may result in a decline in sales.Quarterly fluctuations in our operating results may adversely affect our        stock price.Data        I/O’s operating results tend to vary from quarter to quarter. Our revenue in each        quarter substantially depends upon orders received within that quarter. Conversely, our        expenditures are based on investment plans and estimates of future revenues. We may,        therefore, be unable to quickly reduce our spending if our revenues decline in a given        quarter. As a result, operating results for that quarter will suffer. Our results of        operations for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future        periods.Other        factors, which may cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate, include:•increased competition•timing of new product announcements•product or service releases and pricing changes by us or our                    competitors                      9   •market acceptance or delays in the introduction of new products                    or services•production constraints•quality issues•labor or material shortages•the timing of significant orders•the sales channel mix of direct vs. indirect                    distribution•war or terrorism•health issues (such as SARS)•customers’ budgets•adverse movements in exchange rates, interest rates or tax                    rates•cyclical nature of demand for our customers’                    products•general economic conditions in the countries where we sell                    products•expenses and obtaining authorizations in setting up new                    operations or locationsDue to        all of the foregoing factors, it is possible that in some future quarters, our operating        results will be below expectations of analysts and investors.Failure to adapt to technology trends in our industry may hinder our        competitiveness and financial results.Product        and service technology in Data I/O’s industry evolves rapidly, making timely product        innovation essential to success in the marketplace. Introducing products and services with        improved technologies or features may render our existing products obsolete and        unmarketable. Technological advances that may negatively impact our business        include:•new device package types, densities, and technologies requiring                    hardware and software changes in order to be programmed by our                    products•electronics equipment manufacturing practices, such as                    widespread use of in-circuit programming•customer software platform preferences different from those on                    which our products operate•more rigid industry standards, which would decrease the                    value-added element of our products and support servicesIf we        cannot develop products or services in a timely manner in response to industry changes, or        if our products or services do not perform well, our business and financial condition may        be adversely affected. Also, our new products or services may contain defects or errors        that give rise to product liability claims against us or cause our products to fail to gain        market acceptance. Our future success depends on our ability to successfully compete with        other technology firms in attracting and retaining key technical personnel.A        decline in economic and market conditions may result in decreased capital spending by our        customers.Our        business is highly impacted by capital spending plans and other economic cycles that affect        the users and manufacturers of ICs. These industries are highly cyclical and are        characterized by rapid technological change, short product life cycles, and fluctuations in        manufacturing capacity and pricing and gross margin pressures. As we experienced in recent        years, our operations may in the future reflect substantial fluctuations from        period-to-period as a consequence of these industry patterns, general economic conditions        affecting the timing of orders from major customers, and other factors affecting capital        spending. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial        condition.We        have a history of recent operating losses and may be unable to generate enough revenue to        achieve and maintain profitability.We have        incurred net losses in two of the last five years. We will continue to examine our level of        operating expense based upon our projected revenues. Any planned increases in operating        expenses may result in larger losses in future periods if projected revenues are not        achieved. As a result, we may need to generate greater revenues than we have recently to        achieve and maintain profitability. However, we cannot provide assurance that our revenues        will increase and our strategy may not be successful, resulting in future        losses.                       10   Our        restructuring activities may have a negative impact on our future        operations.Our        restructuring plans may yield unanticipated consequences, such as increased burden on our        administrative, operational, and financial resources and increased responsibilities for our        management personnel. As a result, our ability to respond to unexpected challenges may be        impaired and we may be unable to take advantage of new opportunities.In        addition, many of the employees that were terminated as a part of our restructuring        possessed specific knowledge or expertise, and that knowledge or expertise may prove to        have been important to our operations. In that case, their absence may create significant        difficulties, particularly if our business experiences significant growth. Also, the        reduction in workforce related to our restructuring may subject us to the risk of        litigation, which could result in substantial cost. Any failure by us to properly manage        this rapid change in workforce could impair our ability to efficiently manage our business,        to maintain and develop important relationships with third-parties, and to attract and        retain customers. It could also cause us to incur higher operating cost and delays in the        execution of our business plan or in the reporting or tracking of our financial        results.We        may need to raise additional capital and our future access to capital is        uncertain.Our        past revenues have been and our future revenues may continue to be insufficient to support        the expense of our operations and any expansion of our business. We may therefore need        additional equity or debt capital to finance our operations. If we are unable to generate        sufficient cash flows from operations or to obtain funds through additional debt or equity        financing, we may have to reduce some or all of our development and sales and marketing        efforts and limit the expansion of our business.We        believe our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our working        capital requirements for at least the next twelve months. Thereafter, depending on the        development of our business, we may need to raise additional cash for working capital or        other expenses. We may also encounter opportunities for acquisitions or other business        initiatives that require significant cash commitments, or unanticipated problems or        expenses that could result in a requirement for additional cash before that        time.Therefore, we may seek additional funding through public or private debt or        equity financing or from other sources. We have no commitments for additional financing,        and we may experience difficulty in obtaining funding on favorable terms, if at all. Any        financing we obtain may contain covenants that restrict our freedom to operate our business        or may require us to issue securities that have rights, preferences or privileges senior to        our Common Stock and may dilute your ownership interest.We        may face increased competition and may not be able to compete successfully with current and        future competitors.Technological advances have reduced the barriers of entry into the        programming systems market. We expect competition to increase from both established and        emerging companies. If we fail to compete successfully against current and future sources        of competition, our profitability and financial performance will be adversely        impacted.If        our relationship with semiconductor manufacturers deteriorates, our business may be        adversely affected.We work        closely with most semiconductor manufacturers to ensure that our programming systems comply        with their requirements. In addition, many semiconductor manufacturers recommend our        programming systems for use by users of their programmable devices. These working        relationships enable us to keep our programming systems product lines up to date and        provide end-users with broad and current programmable device support. Our business may be        adversely affected if our relationships with semiconductor manufacturers        deteriorate.Our        reliance on a small number of suppliers may result in a shortage of key components, which        may adversely affect our business.Certain        parts used in our products are currently available from either a single supplier or from a        limited number of suppliers. If we cannot develop alternative sources of these components,        if sales of parts are discontinued by the supplier or we experience deterioration in our        relationship with these suppliers, there may be delays or reductions in product        introductions or shipments, which may materially adversely affect our operating        results.Because        we rely on a small number of suppliers for certain parts, we are subject to possible price        increases by these suppliers. Also, we may be unable to accurately forecast our production        schedule. If we underestimate our production schedule, suppliers may be unable to meet our        demand for components. This delay in the supply of key components may materially adversely        affect our business. Over estimation of demand will lead to excess inventories that may        become obsolete.The        non-automated programming system products we acquired when we acquired SMS in November 1998        are currently manufactured to our specifications by a third-party foreign contract        manufacturer. We may not be able to obtain a sufficient quantity of these products if and        when needed, which may result in lost sales.                       11   If        we are unable to attract and retain qualified third-party distributors, our business may be        adversely affected.Data        I/O has an internal sales force and also utilizes third-party representatives, and        distributors. Therefore, the financial stability of these representatives and distributors        is important. Highly skilled professional engineers use most of our products. To be        effective, third-party distributors must possess significant technical, marketing and sales        resources and must devote their resources to sales efforts, customer education, training        and support. These required qualities limit the number of potential third-party        distributors. Our business will suffer if we cannot attract and retain a sufficient number        of qualified third-party distributors to market our products.Our        international operations may expose us to additional risks that may adversely affect our        business.International sales represented 82% and 78% of our net revenue for the        fiscal year ended December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively. We expect that        international sales will continue to be a significant portion of our net revenue.        International sales may fluctuate due to various factors, including:•migration of manufacturing to low cost geographies•unexpected changes in regulatory requirements•tariffs and taxes•difficulties in establishing, staffing and managing foreign                    operations•longer average payment cycles and difficulty in collecting                    accounts receivable•fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates•compliance with applicable export licensing                    requirements•product safety and other certification requirements•difficulties in integrating foreign and outsourced                    operations•political and economic instabilityBecause        we have customers located throughout the world, we have significant foreign receivables. We        may experience difficulties in collecting these amounts due to payment practices of certain        foreign customers, the availability and reliability of foreign credit information, and        potential difficulties in enforcing collection terms.The        European Community and European Free Trade Association (“EU”) has established        certain electronic emission and product safety requirements (“CE”). Although        our products currently meet these requirements, failure to obtain either a CEcertification        or a waiver for any product may prevent us from marketing that product in Europe. The EU        also has directives concerning the Reduction of Hazardous Substances (“RoHS”)        from which Data I/O is relying on an exemption for test and measurement companies. China is        implementing similar requirements. Failure to meet applicable directives or qualifying        exemption may prevent us from marketing certain products in Europe or other territories        with similar requirements.We        operate subsidiaries in Germany, China, Canada and Brazil. Our business and financial        condition is sensitive to currency exchange rates or any other restrictions imposed on        their currencies. Currency exchange fluctuations in Canada, China, Brazil and Germany may        adversely affect our investment in our subsidiaries.If we        are unable to protect our intellectual property, we may not be able to compete effectively        or operate profitably. Data I/O relies on patents, copyrights, trade secrets and trademarks to        protect our intellectual property, as well as product development and marketing skill to        establish and protect our market position. We attempt to protect our rights in proprietary        software products, including TaskLink and other software products, by retaining the title        to and copyright of the software and documentation, by including appropriate contractual        restrictions on use and disclosure in our licenses, and by requiring our employees to        execute non-disclosure agreements. Because        of the rapidly changing technology in the semiconductor, electronic equipment and software        industries, portions of our products might possibly infringe upon existing patents or        copyrights, and we may, therefore, be required to obtain licenses or discontinue the use of        the infringing technology. We believe that any exposure we may have regarding possible        infringement claims is a reasonable business risk similar to that assumed by other        companies in the electronic equipment and software industries. However, any claim of        infringement, with or without merit, could be costly and a diversion of management’s        attention, and an adverse determination could adversely affect our reputation, preclude us        from offering certain products, and subject us to substantial liability.                       12   We may        pursue business acquisitions that could impair our financial position and        profitability. We may        pursue acquisitions of complementary technologies, product lines or businesses. Future        acquisitions may include risks, such as:•burdening management and our operating teams during the                    integration of the acquired entity•diverting management’s attention from other business                    concerns•failing to successfully integrate the acquired                    products•lack of acceptance of the acquired products by our sales                    channels or customers•entering markets where we have no or limited prior                    experience•potential loss of key employees of the acquired                    company•additional burden of support for an acquired programmer                    architectureFuture        acquisitions may also impact Data I/O’s financial position. For example, we may use        significant cash or incur additional debt, which would weaken our balance sheet. We may        also capitalize goodwill and intangible assets acquired, the impairment of which would        reduce our profitability. We cannot guarantee that future acquisitions will improve our        business or operating results.The        loss of key employees may adversely affect our operations. We have        employees located in the U.S., Germany, and China. We also utilize independent contractors        for specialty work, primarily in research and development, and utilize temporary workers to        adjust capacity to fluctuating demand. Many of our employees are highly skilled and our        continued success will depend in part upon our ability to attract and retain employees who        can be in great demand within the industry. None of our employees are represented by a        collective bargaining unit and we believe relations with our employees are favorable though        no assurance can be made that this will be the case in the future. Refer to the section        captioned “Our restructuring activities may have a negative        impact on our future operations” above. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements may adversely affect our        stock price and business.As a        public company, we are subject to numerous governmental and stock exchange requirements,        with which we believe we are in compliance. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the        Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have requirements that we may fail to meet by the        required deadlines or we may fall out of compliance with, such as the internal controls        auditor attestation required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, with        which we are not yet required to comply as we are not an accelerated filer. Data I/O        assumes it will continue to have the status of a non-accelerated filer based on the        aggregate market value of the voting and non-voting shares held as of June 30, 2007. During        the course of our testing we may identify deficiencies which we may not be able to        remediate in time to meet the deadline imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 for        compliance with the requirements of Section 404. We may also incur additional costs in        order to comply with Section 404. In addition, if we fail to achieve and maintain the        adequacy of our internal controls, as such standards are modified, supplemented or amended        from time to time, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis        that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with        Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Moreover, effective internal controls,        particularly those related to revenue recognition, are necessary for us to produce reliable        financial reports and are important to help prevent financial fraud. If we cannot provide        reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be        harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the        trading price of our stock could drop significantly. Our failure to meet regulatory        requirements and exchange listing standards may result in actions such as the delisting of        our stock impacting our stock’s liquidity; SEC enforcement actions; and securities        claims and litigation.Our        stock price may be volatile and, as a result, you may lose some or all of your        investment.The        stock prices of technology companies tend to fluctuate significantly. We believe factors        such as announcements of new products or services by us or our competitors and quarterly        variations in financial results may cause the market price of Data I/O’s Common Stock        to fluctuate substantially. In addition, overall volatility in the stock market,        particularly in the technology company sector, is often unrelated to the operating        performance of companies. If these market fluctuations continue in the future, they may        adversely affect the price of Data I/O’s Common Stock.                       13   "

Cautionary Factors That May Affect Future ResultsData I/Os disclosure and analysis in this Annual Report contains some forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include our current expectations or forecasts of future events. The reader can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. In particular, these include statements relating to future action, prospective products, new technologies, establishing foreign operations, future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales efforts, expenses, outsourcing of functions, outcome of contingencies, impact of regulatory requirements, restructure actions and financial results.Any or all of the forward-looking statements in this Annual Report or in any other public statement made may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make, or known or unknown risks and uncertainties can affect these forward-looking statements. Many factors -- for example, product competition and product development -- will be important in determining future results. Moreover, neither Data I/O nor anyone else assumes responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of these forward-looking statements. Actual future results may materially vary. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements after the date of this Annual Report, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. The reader should not place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. The reader is advised, however, to consult any future disclosures Data I/O makes on related subjects in our 10-Q, 8-K and 10-K reports to the SEC and press releases. Also, note that Data I/O provides the following cautionary discussion of risks, uncertainties and possible inaccurate assumptions relevant to our business. These are factors that we think could cause Data I/Os actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results. Other factors besides those listed here could also adversely affect Data I/O. This discussion is permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.RISK FACTORSDelays in development, introduction and shipment of new products may result in a decline in sales.Data I/O develops new engineering and automated programming systems. Significant technological, supplier, manufacturing or other problems may delay the development, introduction or production of these products.For example, we may encounter these problems:  technical problems in the development of a new programming system platform or the robotics for new automated handing systems   inability to hire qualified personnel   delays or failures to perform by third parties involved in our development projects  Delays in the development, completion and shipment of new products, or failure of customers to accept new products, may result in a decline in sales.  Quarterly fluctuations in our operating results may adversely affect our stock price.Data I/Os operating results tend tovary from quarter to quarter. Our revenue in each quarter substantially depends uponorders received within that quarter. Conversely, our expenditures are based on investmentplans and estimates of future revenues. We may, therefore, be unable to quickly reduceour spending if our revenues decline in a given quarter. As a result, operating resultsfor that quarter will suffer. Our results of operations for any one quarter are notnecessarily indicative of results for any future periods.  increased competition    timing of new product announcements   product releases and pricing changes by us or our competitors    8     market acceptance or delays in the introduction of new products   production constraints   quality issues   labor or material shortages   the timing of significant orders   the sales channel mix of direct vs. indirect distribution   war or terrorism   health issues (such as SARS)   customers budgets   adverse movements in exchange rates, interest rates or tax rates   cyclical nature of demand for our customers products   general economic conditions in the countries where we sell products   expenses and obtaining authorizations  in setting up new operations or locations  Due to all of the foregoing factors, it is possible that in some future quarters, our operating results will be below expectations of analysts and investors.Failure to adapt to technology trends in our industry may hinder our competitiveness and financial results.Product technology in Data I/Os industry evolves rapidly, making timely product innovation essential to success in the marketplace. Introducing products with improved technologies or features may render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable. Technological advances that may negatively impact our business include:   new device package types, densities, and technologies requiring hardware and software changes in order to be programmed by our products   electronics equipment manufacturing practices, such as widespread use of in-circuit programming   customer software platform preferences different from those on which our products operate   more rigid industry standards, which would decrease the value-added element of our products and support services  If we cannot develop products in a timely manner in response to industry changes, or if our products do not perform well, our business and financial condition may be adversely affected. Also, our new products may contain defects or errors that give rise to product liability claims against us or cause our products to fail to gain market acceptance. Our future success depends on our ability to successfully compete with other technology firms in attracting and retaining key technical personnel.A decline in economic and market conditions may result in decreased capital spending by our customers.Our business is highly impacted by capital spending plans and other economic cycles that affect the users and manufacturers of ICs. These industries are highly cyclical and are characterized by rapid technological change, short product life cycles, and fluctuations in manufacturing capacity and pricing and gross margin pressures. As we experienced in recent years, our operations may in the future reflect substantial fluctuations from period-to-period as a consequence of these industry patterns, general economic conditions affecting the timing of orders from major customers, and other factors affecting capital spending. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.We have a history of recent operating losses and may be unable to generate enough revenue to achieve and maintain profitability.We have incurred net losses in two of the last five years. We will continue to examine our level of operating expense based upon our projected revenues. Any planned increases in operating expenses may result in larger losses in future periods if projected revenues are not achieved. As a result, we may need to generate greater revenues than we have recently to achieve and maintain profitability. However, we cannot provide assurance that our revenues will increase and our strategy may not be successful, resulting in future losses.  9    Our restructuring activities may have a negative impact on our future operations.Our restructuring plans may yield unanticipated consequences, such as increased burden on our administrative, operational, and financial resources and increased responsibilities for our management personnel. As a result, our ability to respond to unexpected challenges may be impaired and we may be unable to take advantage of new opportunities.In addition, many of the employees that were terminated as a part of our restructuring possessed specific knowledge or expertise, and that knowledge or expertise may prove to have been important to our operations. In that case, their absence may create significant difficulties, particularly if our business experiences significant growth. Also, the reduction in workforce related to our restructuring may subject us to the risk of litigation, which could result in substantial cost. Any failure by us to properly manage this rapid change in workforce could impair our ability to efficiently manage our business, to maintain and develop important relationships with third-parties, and to attract and retain customers. It could also cause us to incur higher operating cost and delays in the execution of our business plan or in the reporting or tracking of our financial results.We may need to raise additional capital and our future access to capital is uncertain.Our past revenues have been and our future revenues may continue to be insufficient to support the expense of our operations and any expansion of our business. We may therefore need additional equity or debt capital to finance our operations. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations or to obtain funds through additional debt or equity financing, we may have to reduce some or all of our development and sales and marketing efforts and limit the expansion of our business. We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months. Thereafter, depending on the development of our business, we may need to raise additional cash for working capital or other expenses.  We may also encounter opportunities for acquisitions or other business initiatives that require significant cash commitments, or unanticipated problems or expenses that could result in a requirement for additional cash before that time.Therefore, we may seek additional funding through public or private debt or equity financing or from other sources. We have no commitments for additional financing, and we may experience difficulty in obtaining funding on favorable terms, if at all. Any financing we obtain may contain covenants that restrict our freedom to operate our business or may require us to issue securities that have rights, preferences or privileges senior to our Common Stock and may dilute your ownership interest.We may face increased competition and may not be able to compete successfully with current and future competitors.Technological advances have reduced the barriers of entry into the programming systems market. We expect competition to increase from both established and emerging companies. If we fail to compete successfully against current and future sources of competition, our profitability and financial performance will be adversely impacted.If our relationship with semiconductor manufacturers deteriorates, our business may be adversely affected.We work closely with most semiconductor manufacturers to ensure that our programming systems comply with their requirements. In addition, many semiconductor manufacturers recommend our programming systems for use by users of their programmable devices. These working relationships enable us to keep our programming systems product lines up to date and provide end-users with broad and current programmable device support. Our business may be adversely affected if our relationships with semiconductor manufacturers deteriorate.Our reliance on a small number of suppliers may result in a shortage of key components, which may adversely affect our business.Certain parts used in our products are currently available from either a single supplier or from a limited number of suppliers. If we cannot develop alternative sources of these components, if sales of parts are discontinued by the supplier or we experience deterioration in our relationship with these suppliers, there may be delays or reductions in product introductions or shipments, which may materially adversely affect our operating results.Because we rely on a small number of suppliers for certain parts, we are subject to possible price increases by these suppliers. Also, we may be unable to accurately forecast our production schedule. If we underestimate our production schedule, suppliers may be unable to meet our demand for components. This delay in the supply of key components may materially adversely affect our business. Over estimation of demand will lead to excess inventories that may become obsolete.The non-automated programming system products we acquired when we acquired SMS in November 1998 are currently manufactured to our specifications by a third-party foreign contract manufacturer. We may not be able to obtain a sufficient quantity of these products if and when needed, which may result in lost sales.  10    If we are unable to attract and retain qualified third-party distributors, our business may be adversely affected.Data I/O has an internal sales force and also utilizes third-party representatives, and distributors. Therefore, the financial stability of these representatives and distributors is important. Highly skilled professional engineers use most of our products. To be effective, third-party distributors must possess significant technical, marketing and sales resources and must devote their resources to sales efforts, customer education, training and support. These required qualities limit the number of potential third-party distributors. Our business will suffer if we cannot attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified third-party distributors to market our products.Our international operations may expose us to additional risks that may adversely affect our business.International sales represented 78% of our net revenue for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005.  We expect that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of our net revenue. International sales may fluctuate due to various factors, including: migration of manufacturing to low cost geographies   unexpected changes in regulatory requirements   tariffs and taxes   difficulties in establishing, staffing and managing foreign operations   longer average payment cycles and difficulty in collecting accounts receivable   fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates    compliance with applicable export licensing requirements   product safety and other certification requirements   difficulties in integrating foreign and outsourced operations   political and economic instability  Because we have customers located throughout the world, we have significant foreign receivables. We may experience difficulties in collecting these amounts due to payment practices of certain foreign customers, the availability and reliability of foreign credit information, and potential difficulties in enforcing collection terms. The European Community and European Free Trade Association (EU) has established certain electronic emission and product safety requirements (CE). Although our products currently meet these requirements, failure to obtain either a CE certification or a waiver for any product may prevent us from marketing that product in Europe. The EU also has directives concerning the Reduction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) from which Data I/O is relying on an exemption for test and measurement companies. China is implementing similar requirements. Failure to meet applicable directives or qualifying exemption may prevent us from marketing certain products in Europe or other territories with similar requirements. We operate subsidiaries in Germany, China, Canada and Brazil. Our business and financial condition is sensitive to currency exchange rates or any other restrictions imposed on their currencies. Currency exchange fluctuations in Canada, China, Brazil and Germany may adversely affect our investment in our subsidiaries.If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, we may not be able to compete effectively or operate profitably. Data I/O relies on patents, copyrights, trade secrets and trademarks to protect our intellectual property, as well as product development and marketing skill to establish and protect our market position. We attempt to protect our rights in proprietary software products, including TaskLink and other software products, by retaining the title to and copyright of the software and documentation, by including appropriate contractual restrictions on use and disclosure in our licenses, and by requiring our employees to execute non-disclosure agreements. Because of the rapidly changing technology in the semiconductor, electronic equipment and software industries, portions of our products might possibly infringe upon existing patents or copyrights, and we may, therefore, be required to obtain licenses or discontinue the use of the infringing technology. We believe that any exposure we may have regarding possible infringement claims is a reasonable business risk similar to that assumed by other companies in the electronic equipment and software industries. However, any claim of infringement, with or without merit, could be costly and a diversion of managements attention, and an adverse determination could adversely affect our reputation, preclude us from offering certain products, and subject us to substantial liability.  11    We may pursue business acquisitions that could impair our financial position and profitability.We may pursue acquisitions of complementary technologies, product lines or businesses. Future acquisitions may include risks, such as: burdening management and our operating teams during the integration of the acquired entity   diverting managements attention from other business concerns   failing to successfully integrate the acquired products   lack of acceptance of the acquired products by our sales channels or customers   entering markets where we have no or limited prior experience   potential loss of key employees of the acquired company   additional burden of support for an acquired programmer architecture  Future acquisitions may also impact Data I/Os financial position. For example, we may use significant cash or incur additional debt, which would weaken our balance sheet. We may also capitalize goodwill and intangible assets acquired, the impairment of which would reduce our profitability. We cannot guarantee that future acquisitions will improve our business or operating results.The loss of key employees may adversely affect our operations. We have employees located in the U.S., Germany, and China. We also utilize independent contractors for specialty work, primarily in research and development and in our Brazilian operation, and utilize temporary workers to adjust capacity to fluctuating demand. Many of our employees are highly skilled and our continued success will depend in part upon our ability to attract and retain employees who can be in great demand within the industry. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining unit and we believe relations with our employees are favorable though no assurance can be made that this will be the case in the future. Refer to the section captioned Our restructuring activities may have a negative impact on our future operations above. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements may adversely affect our stock price and business.As a public company, we are subject to numerous  governmental and stock exchangerequirements, with which we believe we are in compliance. The Sarbanes-Oxley Actof 2002 and the Securities and Exchange  Commission (SEC) have requirements thatwe may fail to meet by the required  deadlines or we may fall out of  compliancewith,  such  as  the  internal  controls   assessment,   reporting  and  auditorattestation  required under Section 404 of the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, withwhich we are not yet required to comply as we are not an accelerated  filer. Thecompliance date for non-accelerated filers has been extended to the first fiscalyear ending on or afterDecember 15, 2007 and the auditor attestation requirement has beenextended to the following year.  Data I/O assumes it will continue to havethe status of a non-accelerated filer based on the aggregate market value of thevoting and non-voting  shares held as of June 30, 2006. During the course of ourtesting we may  identify  deficiencies  which we may not be able to remediate intime to  meet  the  deadline  imposed  by the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of  2002  forcompliance with the  requirements  of Section 404. We may also incur  additionalcosts in order to comply with Section  404. In  addition,  if we fail to achieveand  maintain  the  adequacy of our internal  controls,  as such  standards  aremodified,  supplemented  or  amended  from  time to time,  we may not be able toensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective  internalcontrols  over  financial  reporting  in  accordance  with  Section  404  of theSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Moreover, effective internal controls,  particularlythose related to revenue  recognition,  are necessary for us to produce reliablefinancial  reports and are  important to help  prevent  financial  fraud.  If wecannot provide  reliable  financial  reports or prevent fraud,  our business andoperating  results  could be  harmed,  investors  could lose  confidence  in ourreported  financial  information,  and the trading price of our stock could dropsignificantly.  Our failure to meet regulatory requirements and exchange listingstandards may result in actions such as the delisting of our stock impacting ourstocks  liquidity;  SEC  enforcement  actions;  and securities  claims andlitigation.   12    Our stock price may be volatile and, as a result, you may lose some or all of your investment.The stock prices of technology companies tend to fluctuate significantly. We believe factors such as announcements of new products by us or our competitors and quarterly variations in financial results may cause the market price of Data I/Os Common Stock to fluctuate substantially. In addition, overall volatility in the stock market, particularly in the technology company sector, is often unrelated to the operating performance of companies. If these market fluctuations continue in the future, they may adversely affect the price of Data I/Os Common Stock.Failure to successfully implement a new worldwide information system may adversely affect our operations and sales.We have recently acquired and implemented a new worldwide information system. Our corporate office began use of the new system in February 2006. We have also implemented the new system at our subsidiary locations during the third and fourth quarters of 2006. Our operations and financial results could be adversely affected if we are unable to continue using the system effectively and implement additional system functionality without significant interruptions in accounting systems, order entry, billing, manufacturing and other customer support functions. In addition, the new system implementation could cause difficulties in our complying with the internal controls assessment, reporting and auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002"
14,DAIO,DATA I/O CORP,2006-03-31,"ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS- -----------------------CAUTIONARY FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTSData  I/O's  disclosure  and  analysis  in  this  Annual  Report  contains  someforward-looking  statements.  Forward-looking  statements  include  our  currentexpectations  or  forecasts  of future  events.  The reader can  identify  thesestatements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or currentfacts.  In  particular,  these  include  statements  relating to future  action,prospective products, new technologies,  establishing foreign operations, futureperformance  or results of current  and  anticipated  products,  sales  efforts,expenses,  outsourcing  of  functions,  outcome  of  contingencies,   impact  ofregulatory requirements, restructure actions and financial results.Any or all of the  forward-looking  statements  in this Annual  Report or in anyother public  statement  made may turn out to be wrong.  They can be affected byinaccurate   assumptions   we  might  make,   or  known  or  unknown  risks  anduncertainties can affect these forward-looking  statements.  Many factors -- forexample,  product  competition  and product  development -- will be important indetermining future results.  Moreover,  neither Data I/O nor anyone else assumesresponsibility  for the  accuracy  and  completeness  of  these  forward-lookingstatements. Actual future results may materially vary.We undertake no obligation  to publicly  update any  forward-looking  statementsafter the date of this Annual  Report,  whether as a result of new  information,future events or otherwise.  The reader should not place undue  reliance on suchforward-looking  statements.  The reader is  advised,  however,  to consult  anyfuture  disclosures Data I/O makes on related subjects in our 10-Q, 8-K and 10-Kreports to the SEC and press  releases.  Also,  note that Data I/O  provides thefollowing cautionary discussion of risks,  uncertainties and possible inaccurateassumptions  relevant to our  business.  These are  factors  that we think couldcause  Data  I/O's  actual  results  to  differ  materially  from  expected  andhistorical results. Other factors besides those listed here could also adverselyaffect  Data  I/O.  This  discussion  is  permitted  by the  Private  SecuritiesLitigation Reform Act of 1995.RISK FACTORSDELAYS IN DEVELOPMENT, INTRODUCTION AND SHIPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS MAY RESULT IN ADECLINE IN SALES.Data I/O  currently is developing  new  engineering  and  automated  programmingsystems.  Significant technological,  supplier,  manufacturing or other problemsmay delay the development, introduction or production of these products.For example, we may encounter these problems:o    technical  problems in the development of a new programming system platform     or the robotics for new automated handing systemso    inability to hire qualified personnelo    delays or failures to perform by third parties  involved in our development     projectsDelays in the development,  completion and shipment of new products,  or failureof customers to accept new products, may result in a decline in sales.QUARTERLY  FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR OPERATING  RESULTS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR STOCKPRICE.Data I/O's operating  results tend to vary from quarter to quarter.  Our revenuein each quarter  substantially depends upon orders received within that quarter.Conversely,  our  expenditures  are based on  investment  plans and estimates offuture revenues. We may, therefore,  be unable to quickly reduce our spending ifour revenues decline in a given quarter. As a result, operating results for thatquarter  will  suffer.  Our  results of  operations  for any one quarter are notnecessarily indicative of results for any future periods.Other  factors,  which may cause our quarterly  operating  results to fluctuate,include:o    increased competitiono    timing of new product announcementso    product releases and pricing changes by us or our competitorso    market acceptance or delays in the introduction of new products                                       10o    production constraintso    labor or material shortageso    the timing of significant orderso    the sales channel mix of direct vs. indirect distributiono    war or terrorismo    health issues (such as SARS)o    customers' budgetso    adverse movements in exchange rates, interest rates or tax rateso    cyclical nature of demand for our customers' productso    general economic conditions in the countries where we sell productso    expenses  and  obtaining  authorizations  in setting up new  operations  or     locationsDue  to all of the  foregoing  factors,  it is  possible  that  in  some  futurequarters,  our  operating  results  will be below  expectations  of analysts andinvestors.FAILURE  TO  ADAPT  TO  TECHNOLOGY   TRENDS  IN  OUR  INDUSTRY  MAY  HINDER  OURCOMPETITIVENESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS.Product technology in Data I/O's industry evolves rapidly, making timely productinnovation  essential to success in the marketplace.  Introducing  products withimproved  technologies or features may render our existing products obsolete andunmarketable.  Technological  advances that may  negatively  impact our businessinclude:o    new device package types,  densities,  and technologies  requiring hardware     and software changes in order to be programmed by our productso    electronics equipment  manufacturing  practices,  such as widespread use of     in-circuit programmingo    customer  software platform  preferences  different from those on which our     products operateo    more rigid industry standards, which would decrease the value-added element     of our products and support servicesIf we cannot  develop  products  in a timely  manner  in  response  to  industrychanges,  or if our products do not perform  well,  our  business and  financialcondition may be adversely affected.  Also, our new products may contain defectsor errors  that give rise to product  liability  claims  against us or cause ourproducts to fail to gain market  acceptance.  Our future success  depends on ourability to successfully  compete with other  technology  firms in attracting andretaining key technical personnel.A DECLINE IN ECONOMIC  AND MARKET  CONDITIONS  MAY RESULT IN  DECREASED  CAPITALSPENDING BY OUR CUSTOMERS.Our business is highly  impacted by capital  spending  plans and other  economiccycles that affect the users and  manufacturers  of ICs.  These  industries  arehighly  cyclical and are  characterized  by rapid  technological  change,  shortproduct  life cycles,  fluctuations  in  manufacturing  capacity and pricing andgross margin pressures. As we experienced in recent years, our operations may inthe  future  reflect  substantial   fluctuations  from   period-to-period  as  aconsequence of these industry patterns,  general economic  conditions  affectingthe timing of orders from major customers,  and other factors  affecting capitalspending. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business andfinancial condition.WE HAVE A  HISTORY  OF RECENT  OPERATING  LOSSES  AND MAY BE UNABLE TO  GENERATEENOUGH REVENUE TO ACHIEVE AND MAINTAIN PROFITABILITY.We have incurred net losses in three of the last five years. We will continue toexamine our level of operating  expense based upon our projected  revenues.  Anyplanned  increases in operating  expenses may result in larger  losses in futureperiods if projected  revenues  are not  achieved.  As a result,  we may need togenerate  greater  revenues  than we  have  recently  to  achieve  and  maintainprofitability.  However,  we cannot  provide  assurance  that our revenues  willincrease and our strategy may not be successful, resulting in future losses.                                       11OUR PRIOR  RESTRUCTURING  ACTIVITIES  MAY HAVE A  NEGATIVE  IMPACT ON OUR FUTUREOPERATIONS.Our restructuring plans may yield unanticipated consequences,  such as increasedburden on our administrative, operational, and financial resources and increasedresponsibilities  for our  management  personnel.  As a result,  our  ability torespond to  unexpected  challenges  may be impaired and we may be unable to takeadvantage of new opportunities.In  addition,  many  of the  employees  that  were  terminated  as a part of ourrestructuring  possessed specific knowledge or expertise,  and that knowledge orexpertise  may prove to have been  important  to our  operations.  In that case,their absence may create significant difficulties,  particularly if our businessexperiences  significant growth. Also, the reduction in workforce related to ourrestructuring  may subject us to the risk of  litigation,  which could result insubstantial  cost.  Any  failure by us to properly  manage this rapid  change inworkforce  could  impair our  ability to  efficiently  manage our  business,  tomaintain and develop important relationships with third-parties,  and to attractand retain customers.  It could also cause us to incur higher operating cost anddelays in the  execution of our business plan or in the reporting or tracking ofour financial results.WE MAY NEED TO RAISE  ADDITIONAL  CAPITAL  AND OUR  FUTURE  ACCESS TO CAPITAL ISUNCERTAIN.Our  past  revenues  have  been  and our  future  revenues  may  continue  to beinsufficient  to support the expense of our  operations and any expansion of ourbusiness. We may therefore need additional equity or debt capital to finance ouroperations.  If we are unable to generate  sufficient cash flows from operationsor to obtain funds through  additional debt or equity financing,  we may have toreduce some or all of our development and sales and marketing  efforts and limitthe expansion of our business.We believe our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet ourworking capital  requirements  for at least the next twelve months.  Thereafter,depending on the  development of our business,  we may need to raise  additionalcash for working capital or other expenses. We may also encounter  opportunitiesfor  acquisitions or other business  initiatives  that require  significant cashcommitments,  or  unanticipated  problems  or  expenses  that could  result in arequirement for additional cash before that time.Therefore,  we may seek  additional  funding  through  public or private debt orequity  financing or from other sources.  We have no commitments  for additionalfinancing,  and we may experience  difficulty in obtaining  funding on favorableterms,  if at all. Any financing we obtain may contain  covenants  that restrictour freedom to operate our business or may require us to issue  securities  thathave rights, preferences or privileges senior to our Common Stock and may diluteyour ownership interest.WE MAY FACE INCREASED  COMPETITION  AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COMPETE  SUCCESSFULLYWITH CURRENT AND FUTURE COMPETITORS.Technological  advances have reduced the barriers of entry into the  programmingsystems  market.  We expect  competition to increase from both  established  andemerging  companies.  If we fail to compete  successfully  against  current  andfuture sources of competition,  our profitability and financial performance willbe adversely impacted.IF OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURERS DETERIORATES,  OUR BUSINESSMAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.We work  closely  with  most  semiconductor  manufacturers  to  ensure  that ourprogramming   systems  comply  with  their  requirements.   In  addition,   manysemiconductor  manufacturers  recommend our programming systems for use by usersof their programmable devices. These working relationships enable us to keep ourprogramming  systems  product lines up to date and provide  end-users with broadand current  programmable device support. Our business may be adversely affectedif our relationships with semiconductor manufacturers deteriorate.OUR  RELIANCE  ON A SMALL  NUMBER OF  SUPPLIERS  MAY RESULT IN A SHORTAGE OF KEYCOMPONENTS, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.Certain parts used in our products are currently  available from either a singlesupplier or from a limited number of suppliers. If we cannot develop alternativesources of these components,  if sales of parts are discontinued by the supplieror we experience  deterioration in our relationship with these suppliers,  theremay be delays or reductions  in product  introductions  or shipments,  which maymaterially adversely affect our operating results.Because we rely on a small number of suppliers for certain parts, we are subjectto  possible  price  increases  by these  suppliers.  Also,  we may be unable toaccurately forecast our production schedule.  If we underestimate our productionschedule,  suppliers may be unable to meet our demand for components. This delayin the supply of key components may  materially  adversely  affect our business.Over  estimation  of  demand  will lead to excess  inventories  that may  becomeobsolete.The non-automated  programming  system products we acquired when we acquired SMSin  November  1998  are  currently  manufactured  to  our  specifications  by  athird-party  foreign  contract  manufacturer.  We may not be able  to  obtain  asufficient  quantity of these  products if and when needed,  which may result inlost sales.                                       12IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED THIRD-PARTY  DISTRIBUTORS,  OURBUSINESS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.Data  I/O  has  an   internal   sales  force  and  also   utilizes   third-partyrepresentatives,  and distributors.  Therefore, the financial stability of theserepresentatives  and  distributors  is important.  Highly  skilled  professionalengineers use most of our products.  To be effective,  third-party  distributorsmust possess  significant  technical,  marketing  and sales  resources  and mustdevote  their  resources  to sales  efforts,  customer  education,  training andsupport.  These  required  qualities  limit the number of potential  third-partydistributors.  Our  business  will  suffer if we  cannot  attract  and  retain asufficient number of qualified third-party distributors to market our products.OUR  INTERNATIONAL  OPERATIONS  MAY  EXPOSE  US TO  ADDITIONAL  RISKS  THAT  MAYADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.International sales represented 78% of our net revenue for the fiscal year endedDecember 31, 2005 and 80% for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004. We expectthat  international  sales will continue to be a significant  portion of our netrevenue. International sales may fluctuate due to various factors, including:o    migration of manufacturing to low cost geographieso    unexpected changes in regulatory requirementso    tariffs and taxeso    difficulties in establishing, staffing and managing foreign operationso    longer  average  payment  cycles  and  difficulty  in  collecting  accounts     receivableo    fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rateso    compliance with applicable export licensing requirementso    product safety and other certification requirementso    difficulties in integrating foreign and outsourced operationso    political and economic instabilityThe  European   Community  and  European  Free  Trade  Association   (""EU"")  hasestablished certain electronic emission and product safety requirements  (""CE"").Although  our  products  currently  meet these  requirements,  failure to obtaineither a CE  certification  or a waiver  for any  product  may  prevent  us frommarketing  that product in Europe.  The EU also has  directives  concerning  theReduction of Hazardous  Substances (""RoHS"") from which Data I/O is relying on anexemption  for  test  and  measurement  companies.  Failure  to meet  applicabledirectives  or  qualifying  exemption  may  prevent  us from  marketing  certainproducts in Europe or other territories with similar requirements.We operate  subsidiaries in Germany,  China, Canada and Brazil. Our business andfinancial  condition  is  sensitive  to  currency  exchange  rates or any  otherrestrictions  imposed on their  currencies.  Currency  exchange  fluctuations inCanada,  China,  Brazil and Germany may adversely  affect our  investment in oursubsidiaries.IF WE ARE UNABLE TO PROTECT  OUR  INTELLECTUAL  PROPERTY,  WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TOCOMPETE EFFECTIVELY OR OPERATE PROFITABLY.Data I/O relies on patents,  copyrights, trade secrets and trademarks to protectour intellectual property, as well as product development and marketing skill toestablish and protect our market  position.  We attempt to protect our rights inproprietary  software products,  including TaskLink and other software products,by retaining  the title to and copyright of the software and  documentation,  byincluding  appropriate  contractual  restrictions  on use and  disclosure in ourlicenses, and by requiring our employees to execute non-disclosure agreements.Because of the rapidly  changing  technology  in the  semiconductor,  electronicequipment  and  software  industries,  portions of our products  might  possiblyinfringe upon existing patents or copyrights, and we may, therefore, be requiredto obtain  licenses or  discontinue  the use of the  infringing  technology.  Webelieve that any exposure we may have regarding possible  infringement claims isa reasonable  business  risk  similar to that assumed by other  companies in theelectronic   equipment   and  software   industries.   However,   any  claim  ofinfringement,  with or  without  merit,  could  be  costly  and a  diversion  ofmanagement's attention,  and an adverse determination could adversely affect ourreputation,  preclude  us from  offering  certain  products,  and  subject us tosubstantial liability.                                       13WE MAY PURSUE BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS THAT COULD IMPAIR OUR FINANCIAL POSITION ANDPROFITABILITY.We may pursue  acquisitions  of  complementary  technologies,  product  lines orbusinesses. Future acquisitions may include risks, such as:o    burdening  management and our operating teams during the integration of the     acquired entityo    diverting management's attention from other business concernso    failing to successfully integrate the acquired productso    lack of  acceptance  of the  acquired  products  by our sales  channels  or     customerso    entering markets where we have no or limited prior experienceo    potential loss of key employees of the acquired companyo    additional burden of support for an acquired programmer architectureFuture acquisitions may also impact Data I/O's financial position.  For example,we may use significant  cash or incur  additional  debt,  which would weaken ourbalance sheet. We may also capitalize  goodwill and intangible  assets acquired,the impairment of which would reduce our profitability. We cannot guarantee thatfuture acquisitions will improve our business or operating results.THE LOSS OF KEY EMPLOYEES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS.We have  employees  located in the U.S.,  Germany,  Canada  and  China.  We alsoutilize  independent  contractors for specialty work,  primarily in research anddevelopment and in our Brazilian  operation,  and utilize  temporary  workers toadjust capacity to fluctuating  demand. Many of our employees are highly skilledand our  continued  success  will depend in part upon our ability to attract andretain  employees who can be in great demand  within the  industry.  None of ouremployees  are  represented  by a  collective  bargaining  unit  and we  believerelations with our employees are favorable  though no assurance can be made thatthis will be the case in the future.  Refer to the section  captioned ""Our priorrestructuring  activities may have a negative  impact on our future  operations""above.FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH REGULATORY  REQUIREMENTS  MAY ADVERSELY  AFFECT OUR STOCKPRICE AND BUSINESS.As a public company, we are subject to numerous  governmental and stock exchangerequirements, with which we believe we are in compliance. The Sarbanes-Oxley Actof 2002 and the Securities and Exchange  Commission (SEC) have requirements thatwe may fail to meet by the required  deadlines or we may fall out of  compliancewith,  such  as  the  internal  controls   assessment,   reporting  and  auditorattestation  required under Section 404 of the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, withwhich we are not yet required to comply as we are not an accelerated  filer. Thecompliance date for non-accelerated filers has been extended to the first fiscalyear ending on or after July 15, 2007. Data I/O assumes it will continue to havethe status of a non-accelerated filer based on the aggregate market value of thevoting and non-voting  shares held as of June 30, 2005. During the course of ourtesting we may  identify  deficiencies  which we may not be able to remediate intime to  meet  the  deadline  imposed  by the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of  2002  forcompliance with the  requirements  of Section 404. We may also incur  additionalcosts in order to comply with Section  404. In  addition,  if we fail to achieveand  maintain  the  adequacy of our internal  controls,  as such  standards  aremodified,  supplemented  or  amended  from  time to time,  we may not be able toensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective  internalcontrols  over  financial  reporting  in  accordance  with  Section  404  of theSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Moreover, effective internal controls,  particularlythose related to revenue  recognition,  are necessary for us to produce reliablefinancial  reports and are  important to help  prevent  financial  fraud.  If wecannot provide  reliable  financial  reports or prevent fraud,  our business andoperating  results  could be  harmed,  investors  could lose  confidence  in ourreported  financial  information,  and the trading price of our stock could dropsignificantly.  Our failure to meet regulatory requirements and exchange listingstandards may result in actions such as the delisting of our stock impacting ourstock's  liquidity;   SEC  enforcement   actions;   and  securities  claims  andlitigation.OUR STOCK  PRICE MAY BE VOLATILE  AND, AS A RESULT,  YOU MAY LOSE SOME OR ALL OFYOUR INVESTMENT.The stock prices of technology  companies  tend to fluctuate  significantly.  Webelieve factors such as  announcements  of new products by us or our competitorsand quarterly variations in financial results may cause the market price of DataI/O's Common Stock to fluctuate substantially.  In addition,  overall volatilityin the stock market,  particularly in the technology  company  sector,  is oftenunrelated  to  the  operating   performance   of  companies.   If  these  marketfluctuations continue in the future, they may adversely affect the price of DataI/O's Common Stock.                                       14FAILURE  TO  SUCCESSFULLY  IMPLEMENT  A NEW  WORLDWIDE  INFORMATION  SYSTEM  MAYADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS AND SALES.We  have  recently  acquired  and are  currently  implementing  a new  worldwideinformation system. Our corporate office began use of the new system in February2006. We are now in the process of implementing the new system at our subsidiarylocations.
