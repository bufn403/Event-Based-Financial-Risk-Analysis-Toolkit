2,ADI,ANALOG DEVICES,2023-11-21,"ITEM 1A.         RISK FACTORSSet forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are descriptions of certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements in this report. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also adversely affect our business. For more information, see the section titled “Note About Forward-Looking Statements” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Risks Related to our Business, Operations, Industry and PartnersGlobal political and economic uncertainty and adverse conditions related to our international operations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have significant operations and manufacturing facilities outside the United States, including in Ireland, the Philippines, Thailand, and Malaysia. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from customers in international markets, and we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the future. As a result of our international operations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted by, among others, the following factors:•political, legal and economic changes, crises or instability and civil unrest that may impact markets in which we do business, such as macroeconomic weakness related to trade and political disputes between the United States and China, tensions across the Taiwan Strait that may adversely affect our operations in Taiwan, our customers and the technology industry supply chain, and the ongoing conflicts between Israel and Hamas and between Russia and Ukraine;•compliance requirements of customs and export regulations, including the Export Administration Regulations and the International Traffic and Arms Regulations;•currency conversion risks and exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations, including the potential impact of elevated interest rates;•instability of global credit and financial markets due to adverse macroeconomic conditions such as rising inflation, high interest rates, bank failures and slower economic growth or recession that could, among other impacts, affect our ability to access external financing sources on acceptable terms or lead to financial difficulties or uncertainty of our customers, suppliers and distributors exposing us to late payments, cancelled orders and inventory challenges;•trade policy, commercial, travel, export or taxation disputes or restrictions, import or export tariffs, changes to export classifications or other restrictions imposed by the U.S. government or by the governments of the countries in which we do business, particularly with respect to China; •sanctions imposed by governments in countries in which we do business, including those imposed on Russia by, among others, the European Union, the United States and the United Kingdom in response to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which sanctions restrict a wide range of trade and financial dealings with Russian and Russian persons, as well as with certain regions in Ukraine; •complex, varying and changing government regulations and legal standards and requirements, particularly with respect to tax, price protection, competition practices, export control, customs, immigration, anti-boycott, data privacy, cyber and product security, sustainability, climate and other ESG matters, intellectual property, anti-corruption, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and environmental compliance;•economic disruption from terrorism and threats of terrorism and the response to them by the United States and its allies;•increased managerial complexities, including different employment practices and labor issues;•changes in immigration laws, regulations and procedures and enforcement practices of various government agencies;•greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting such rights;•natural disasters, public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or other catastrophic events;•transportation disruptions and delays and increases in labor and transportation costs;•fluctuations in raw material costs and energy costs due to general market factors and conditions such as inflationary pressures and supply chain constraints; •greater difficulty in accounts receivable collections and longer collection periods; and•increased costs associated with our foreign defined benefit pension plans.11Many of these factors and risks are present and may be exacerbated within our business operations in China. For example, changes in U.S.-China relations, the political environment or international trade policies could result in further revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of import or export duties and tariffs, restrictions on imports or exports, currency revaluations or retaliatory actions, which have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results. In addition, expanded export restrictions limit our ability to sell to certain Chinese companies and to third parties that do business with those companies. These restrictions have created and these and similar restrictions may continue to create uncertainty and caution with our current or prospective customers and may cause them to amass large inventories of our products, replace our products with products from another supplier that is not subject to the export restrictions or focus on building indigenous semiconductor capacity to reduce reliance on U.S. suppliers. Furthermore, if these export restrictions cause our current or potential customers to view U.S. companies as unreliable, we could suffer reputational damage or lose business to foreign competitors who are not subject to such export restrictions, and our business could be materially harmed. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of these restrictions on our business, but these actions may have direct and indirect adverse impacts on our revenues and results of operations in China and elsewhere. In addition, our success in the Chinese markets may be adversely affected by China’s continuously evolving policies, laws and regulations, including those relating to antitrust, cybersecurity, data protection and data privacy, the environment, indigenous innovation and the promotion of a domestic semiconductor industry and intellectual property rights and enforcement and protection of those rights. The markets for semiconductor products are cyclical, and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices, and conversely, we may not be able to satisfy unexpected demand for our products. The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly. If we overbuild inventory in a period of decreased demand, or we expand our operations and workforce too rapidly or procure excessive resources in anticipation of increased demand for our products, and that demand does not materialize at the pace at which we expect, or declines, our operating results may be adversely affected as a result of underutilization of capacity, charges related to obsolete inventory, asset impairment or inventory write-downs, increased operating expenses or reduced margins. For example, we have experienced, and may in the future experience, periods of customer inventory adjustments that may adversely affect our operating results. Further, any capacity expansions by us or other semiconductor manufacturers could also lead to overcapacity in our target markets which could lead to price erosion that could adversely impact our operating results. Conversely, during periods of rapid increases in demand, our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy the demand. In addition, we may not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner, procure adequate resources and raw materials, locate suitable third-party suppliers or respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to demand for new products requested by our customers, and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected.We rely on third parties for supply of raw materials and parts, semiconductor wafer foundry services, assembly and test services and transportation, among other things, and we generally cannot control their availability or conditions of supply or services. We rely, and plan to continue to rely, on third-party suppliers and service providers, including raw material and components suppliers, semiconductor wafer foundries, assembly and test contractors and freight carriers (collectively, vendors), in manufacturing and shipping our products. This reliance involves several risks, including reduced control over availability, capacity utilization, delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, costs and supply chain allocations. We currently source more than half of our wafer requirements annually from third-party wafer foundries, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and others. These foundries often provide wafer foundry services to our competitors and therefore periods of increased industry demand may result in capacity constraints. With respect to TSMC in particular, tensions across the Taiwan Strait or other geopolitical events could disrupt TSMC’s operations, which would adversely affect our ability to manufacture certain products and as a result, could adversely affect our business and results of operations.Our manufacturing processes require availability of certain raw materials and supplies. Limited or delayed access to these items could adversely affect our results of operations. In certain instances, one of our vendors may be the sole source of highly specialized processing services or materials. If such vendor is unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver components to us on the time schedule and of the quality or quantity that we require, we may be forced to seek to engage an additional or replacement vendor, which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers. If additional or replacement vendors are not available, we may also experience delays in product development or shipment which could, in turn, result in reputational harm or the temporary or permanent loss of customers, and as a result could adversely affect our business and results of operations.12Our industry faces challenges associated with products diverted from authorized distribution channels, which could result in reputational harm and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We market and sell our products directly and through third-party distributors. There is a risk that our products may be diverted from our authorized distribution channels and sold on the “gray market” in ways that are not in accordance with our established agreements, controls, policies and procedures. Purchasers that acquire our products via the gray market or through other unauthorized channels may resell or otherwise use our products for purposes for which they were not intended or that may be contrary to our ethical, legal and regulatory obligations. Organizations may also purchase counterfeit or substandard products, including products that have been altered, mishandled or damaged, or purchase used products presented as new, each of which could result in damage to property or persons. These situations could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business and operating results. A prolonged disruption of our or our third parties’ manufacturing operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition to leveraging an outsourcing model for certain manufacturing operations, we also rely on our internal manufacturing operations located in the United States, Ireland, the Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia. A prolonged disruption at, or inability to utilize, one or more of our or our third parties’ manufacturing facilities, loss of raw materials or damage to our or our third parties’ manufacturing equipment for any reason, including due to natural or man-made disasters, civil unrest or other events outside of our control, such as widespread outbreaks of illness, or the failure to maintain our labor force at one or more of these facilities, may disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in us being unable to timely satisfy customer demand. As a result, we could forgo revenue opportunities, potentially lose market share and damage our customer relationships, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our future success depends upon our ability to execute our business strategy, continue to innovate, improve our existing products, design, develop, produce and market new products, and identify and enter new markets. Our future success significantly depends on our ability to execute our business strategy, continue to innovate, improve our existing products, and design, develop, produce and market innovative new products and system-level solutions, including those that may incorporate, or are based upon, software or artificial intelligence technology. Product design, development, innovation and enhancement is often a complex, time-consuming and costly process involving significant investment in research and development with no assurance of return on investment. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new and improved products in a timely or efficient manner or that new and improved products, if developed, will achieve market acceptance. Our products generally must conform to various evolving and sometimes competing industry standards, which may adversely affect our ability to compete in certain markets or require us to incur significant costs. In addition, our customers generally impose very high quality and reliability standards on our products, which often change and may be difficult or costly to satisfy. Any inability to satisfy customer quality and reliability standards or comply with industry standards and technical requirements may adversely affect demand for our products and our results of operations. Our growth is also dependent on our ability to identify and penetrate new markets where we have limited experience yet require significant investments, resources and technological advancements in order to compete effectively, and there can be no assurance that we will achieve success in these markets. Further, there can be no assurance that the markets we serve and target based on our business strategy will grow in the future, that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets, that our products, or the end-products in which our products are used, will achieve customer acceptance in these markets, that competitors will not force price reductions or take market share from us or that we can achieve or maintain adequate gross margins or profits in these markets.Our future revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate. Our future revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors, including:•the effects of adverse economic conditions in the markets in which we sell our products, including inflationary pressures, which has resulted, and may continue to result, in increased interest rates, fuel prices, wages and other costs;•changes in customer demand or order patterns for our products or for end products that incorporate our products;•the timing, delay, reduction or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability to manage inventory;•our ability to accurately forecast distributor demand for our products;•future distributor pricing credits or stock rotation rights;•our ability to effectively manage our cost structure in both the short term and over a longer duration;13•changes in geographic, product or customer mix;•changes in our effective tax rates or new or revised tax legislation in the United States, Ireland or worldwide; •the effects of issued, threatened or retaliatory government sanctions, trade barriers or economic restrictions; changes in law, regulations or other restrictions, including executive orders; and changes in import and export regulations, including restrictions on exports to certain companies or to third parties that do business with such companies, export classifications, or duties and tariffs, including with respect to China; •the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us, our customers or our competitors and the market acceptance of such products;•pricing decisions and competitive pricing pressures;•fluctuations in manufacturing yields, adequate availability of wafers and other raw materials, and manufacturing, assembly and test capacity;•the ability of our third-party suppliers, subcontractors and manufacturers to supply us with sufficient quantities of raw materials, products and components;•a decline in infrastructure spending by foreign governments, including China;•a decline in the U.S. government defense budget, changes in spending or budgetary priorities, a prolonged U.S. government shutdown or delays in contract awards;•a decline in our backlog;•our ability to recruit, hire, retain and motivate adequate numbers of engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of our customers;•our ability to generate new design opportunities and win competitive bid selection processes;•the increasing costs of providing employee benefits worldwide, including health insurance, retirement and pension plan contributions and other retirement benefits; •our ability to utilize our manufacturing facilities at efficient levels;•fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;•litigation-related costs or product liability, warranty and indemnity claims, including those not covered by our suppliers or insurers;•the difficulties inherent in forecasting future operating expense levels, including with respect to costs associated with labor, utilities, transportation and raw materials;•the costs related to compliance with increasing worldwide complex government regulations and legal standards and requirements, including those related to ESG matters; •new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting standards and practices; and•the effects of public health emergencies, civil unrest, natural disasters or other severe weather events, widespread travel disruptions, security risks, terrorist activities, international conflicts and other events beyond our control.In addition, the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic upturns and downturns. Our business and certain of the end markets we serve are also subject to rapid technological changes and material fluctuations in demand based on end-user preferences. There can be no assurance that products stocked in our inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them or that we will be able to design, develop and produce products in a timely fashion to accommodate changing customer demand.  As a result of these and other factors, we may experience material fluctuations in future revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share on a quarterly or annual basis. Our historical financial performance and results of operations should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance or results. In addition, if our revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share results or expectations do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the market price of our common stock may decline.We may not be able to compete successfully in markets within the semiconductor industry in the future. We face intense competition in the semiconductor industry, and we expect this competition to increase in the future, including from companies located outside of the United States. Competition is generally based on innovation, design, quality and reliability of products, product performance, features and functionality, product pricing, availability and capacity, technological service and support and the availability of integrated system solutions, with the relative importance of these factors varying among products, markets and customers. Many companies have sufficient financial, manufacturing, technical, sales and marketing resources to develop and market products that compete with our products. Some of our competitors may 14have more advantageous supply or development relationships with our current and potential customers or suppliers. Our competitors also include both emerging companies selling specialized products in markets we serve and companies outside of the United States, including entities associated with well-funded efforts by foreign governments to create indigenous semiconductor industries. From time to time, governments around the world may provide incentives or make other investments that could benefit and give competitive advantages to our competitors. For example, in August 2022, the United States government enacted the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 to provide financial incentives to the U.S. semiconductor industry. Government incentives, including any that may be offered in connection with the CHIPS Act, may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If our competitors can benefit from such government incentives and we cannot, it could strengthen our competitors' relative position and have a material adverse effect on our business. Existing or new competitors may develop products or technologies that more effectively address the demands of our customers and markets with enhanced performance, features and functionality, lower power requirements, greater levels of integration or lower cost. In addition, as we seek to expand our business, including the design and production of products and services for developing and emerging markets, we may encounter increased competition from our current and new competitors. Increased competition in certain markets has resulted in and may continue to result in declining average selling prices, reduced gross margins and loss of market share in those markets. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors, or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased competition. In addition, the semiconductor industry has experienced significant consolidation over the past several years. Consolidation among our competitors could lead to a changing competitive landscape, which could negatively impact our competitive position and market share and harm our results of operations.If we are unable to recruit or retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our business strategy will be adversely affected. Our continued success depends to a significant extent upon the recruitment, retention and effective succession of our key personnel, including our leadership team, management and technical personnel, particularly our experienced engineers. The competition for these employees is intense and the labor market is tight. The loss of key personnel or the inability to attract, timely hire and retain key employees with critical technical skills to achieve our strategy, including as a result of changes to immigration policies, could cause business disruptions, increased expenses to address any disruptions and could have a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that a critical contributor to our success to date has been our corporate culture, which we have built to foster innovation, teamwork and employee satisfaction. As we grow, including from the integration of employees and businesses acquired in connection with previous or future acquisitions, we may find it difficult to maintain important aspects of our corporate culture, which could negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel who are essential to our future success.We do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or other employees. The loss of one or more of our key employees, and any failure to have in place and execute an effective succession plan for key executives, could seriously harm our business and results of operations.Our customers typically do not make long-term product purchase commitments, and incorrect forecasts or reductions, cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results. We typically do not have sales contracts with our customers that include long-term product purchase commitments. In certain markets where end-user demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict, some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment, even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all, or even any, of the product. In other instances, we manufacture product based on non-binding forecasts of customer demands, which may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis and at times may prove to be inaccurate. Additionally, our U.S. government contracts and subcontracts may be funded in increments over a number of government budget periods and typically can be terminated by the government for its convenience. As a result, we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales, and we are subject to the risk of lower than expected orders or cancellations of orders, leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog. Further, if orders or forecasts for products that meet a customer’s unique requirements are canceled or unrealized we may be left with an inventory of unsaleable products, causing potential inventory write-offs, and hindering our ability to recover our costs. The foregoing risks may be exacerbated in times of macroeconomic uncertainty, including as a result of rising inflation, high interest rates, bank failures and slower economic growth or recession. Incorrect forecasts, or reductions, cancellations or delays in orders for our products, could adversely affect our operating results.Our operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors. A significant portion of our sales are through independent global and regional distributors that are not under our control. These independent distributors generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts for our products or they could terminate their representation of us. We generally do not require letters of credit from our 15distributors, including our largest distributor, and are not protected against accounts receivable default or declarations of bankruptcy by these distributors. Our inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our operating results. Termination of a significant distributor or a group of distributors, whether at our initiative or the distributor’s initiative or through consolidation in the distribution industry, could disrupt our business, and if we are unable to find suitable replacements with the appropriate scale and resources, our operating results could be adversely affected.We are required to estimate the effects of returns and allowances provided to distributors and record revenue at the time of sale to the distributor. If our estimates of such credits and rights are materially understated, it could cause subsequent adjustments that negatively impact our revenues and gross profits in a future period.Our semiconductor products are complex and we may be subject to warranty, indemnity or product liability claims, which could result in significant costs and damage to our reputation and adversely affect customer relationships, the market acceptance of our products and our operating results. Semiconductor products are highly complex and may contain defects that affect their quality or performance. Failures in our products and services or in the products of our customers could result in damage to our reputation for reliability and increase our legal or financial exposure to third parties. Certain of our products and services, including those that may incorporate, or are based upon, software or artificial intelligence technology, could also contain security vulnerabilities, defects, bugs and errors, which could also result in significant data losses, security breaches and theft of intellectual property. We generally warrant that our products will meet their published specifications, and that we will repair or replace defective products, for one year from the date title passes from us to the customer. We invest significant resources in the testing of our products; however, if any of our products contain security vulnerabilities, defects, bugs or errors, we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders. These problems may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or others, including liability for costs and expenses associated with product defects, including recalls, which may adversely impact our reputation and operating results. We may also be subject to customer intellectual property indemnity claims. Our customers have on occasion been sued, and may be sued in the future, by third parties alleging infringement of intellectual property rights, or damages resulting from use of our products. Those customers may seek indemnification from us under the terms and conditions of our sales contracts with them. In certain cases, our potential indemnification liability may be significant. Further, we sell to customers in industries such as automotive (including autonomous vehicles), aerospace, defense and healthcare, where failure of the systems in which our products are integrated could cause damage to property or persons. We may be subject to product liability claims if our products, or the integration of our products, cause system failures. Any product liability claim, whether or not determined in our favor, could result in significant expense, divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, and harm our business. In addition, if any of our products contain defects, or have reliability, quality or compatibility problems not capable of being resolved, our reputation may be damaged, which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to customers and which could also adversely affect our operating results. The fabrication of integrated circuits is highly complex and precise, and our manufacturing processes utilize a substantial amount of technology. Minute impurities, contaminants in the manufacturing environment, difficulties in the fabrication process, defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process, manufacturing equipment failures, wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional. While we have significant expertise in semiconductor manufacturing, it is possible that some processes could become unstable. This instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.Risk Related to Acquisitions and Strategic Transactions Our acquisition of Maxim involves a number of risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals we anticipate. In August 2021, we completed our acquisition of Maxim, which we refer to as the acquisition or the merger. The ultimate success of the merger will depend on, among other things, the ability to continue to combine the two businesses in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities. Further, there are a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that must continue to be integrated in connection with the ongoing integration of Maxim’s business. The combined company has and may continue to incur ongoing restructuring, integration and other costs associated with combining the operations of the two companies in connection with the merger. It is possible that the ongoing integration process could result in the loss of customers, the disruption of ongoing businesses, inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies, unexpected integration issues, higher than expected integration costs and an overall integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated and actual growth, if achieved, may be lower than what we expect and may take longer to achieve than anticipated. There can be no assurances that the two businesses can be integrated successfully in a way 16that maximizes the combined business to the fullest extent. If we are not able to successfully achieve our objectives, the benefits of the merger may not be fully realized or may take longer to achieve than expected. To remain competitive, we may need to invest in or acquire other companies, purchase or license technology from third parties, or enter into other strategic transactions in order to introduce new products or enhance our existing products. An element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisitions of businesses, assets, products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings, diversify our product portfolio, expand our market coverage, increase our engineering workforce, expand our technical skill sets or enhance our technological capabilities. We may not be able to find businesses that have the technology or resources we need and, if we find such businesses, we may not be able to invest in, purchase or license the technology or resources on commercially favorable terms or at all. Acquisitions, investments and technology licenses are challenging to complete for a number of reasons, including difficulties in identifying potential targets, the cost of potential transactions, competition among prospective buyers and licensees, the need for regulatory approvals, and difficulties related to integration efforts. In addition, investments in companies are subject to a risk of a partial or total loss of our investment. Both in the United States and abroad, governmental regulation of acquisitions, including antitrust and other regulatory reviews and approvals, has become more complex, increasing the costs and risks of undertaking and consummating significant acquisitions. In order to finance a potential transaction, we may need to raise additional funds by issuing securities or borrowing money. We may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms, and the sale of our stock may result in the dilution of our existing shareholders or the issuance of securities with rights that are superior to the rights of our common shareholders.Acquisitions also involve a number of challenges and risks, including:•diversion of management’s attention in connection with both negotiating the transaction and integrating the acquired assets and businesses;•difficulty or delay integrating acquired technologies, operations, systems, infrastructure and personnel with our existing businesses;•strain on managerial and operational resources as management oversees larger or more complex operations;•future funding requirements for acquired companies, including research and development costs, employee compensation and benefits, and operating expenses, which may be significant;•servicing significant debt that may be incurred in connection with acquisitions; •potential loss of key employees;•exposure to unforeseen liabilities or regulatory compliance issues of acquired companies; •higher than expected or unexpected acquisition or integration costs;•difficulty realizing expected cost savings, operating synergies and growth prospects of an acquisition in a timely manner or at all; and•increased risk of costly and time-consuming legal proceedings.If we are unable to successfully address these risks, we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of our acquisitions, which may have an adverse effect on our business strategy, plans and operating results.Risks Related to Cyber, Intellectual Property, Legal and Regulatory Our computer systems and networks may be subject to attempted security breaches and other cyber incidents and a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems or certain products could materially and adversely affect our business or reputation. We rely on information technology systems throughout our company to keep financial records and customer data, process orders, manage inventory, coordinate shipments to customers, maintain confidential and proprietary information, assist in semiconductor engineering and other technical activities and operate other critical functions such as Internet connectivity, network communications and email. In addition, we provide our confidential and proprietary information to our strategic partners in certain cases, who may maintain such information on their information technology systems. Our security measures or those of our third-party service providers or strategic partners may not detect or prevent security breaches, cyberattacks, defects, bugs or errors. Further, geopolitical tensions or conflicts may escalate the volume and sophistication of cyberattacks, thereby making it more difficult to detect, mitigate and defend against them. We and our third-party service providers or strategic partners may be subject to security breaches of information technology systems or certain products caused by viruses, illegal break-ins or hacking, sabotage, other cyberattacks or acts of vandalism by third parties or our employees or contractors. In the event of a breach, our operations may be disrupted, our proprietary information or that of our employees, contractors, partners, customers, suppliers or other third parties may be misappropriated, and we could be exposed to potential liability, 17litigation, and regulatory action, as well as the loss of existing or potential customers, damage to our reputation and other financial loss. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of responding to breaches and implementing remediation measures could be significant.Our information technology systems and those of our third-party service providers and strategic partners may also be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. If we were to experience a prolonged disruption in the information technology systems that involve our internal communications or our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business.We may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary intellectual property rights, which may limit our ability to compete effectively. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We primarily rely on patent, mask work, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure agreements, information security practices and other methods, to protect our proprietary information, technologies and processes. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain or disclose our confidential information, reverse engineer or copy our technologies, products or processes, make unlicensed copies or engage in unapproved distributions of our technology for unauthorized uses, or otherwise misappropriate our intellectual property. Moreover, the laws of foreign countries in which we design, manufacture, market and sell our products may afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property.There can be no assurance that the claims allowed in our issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. In addition, any of our existing or future patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. As such, any rights granted under these patents may not prevent others from exploiting our proprietary technology. We may not be able to obtain foreign patents or pending applications corresponding to our U.S. patents and applications. Even if patents are granted, we may not be able to effectively enforce our rights. If our patents and mask works do not adequately protect our technology, or if our registrations expire prior to end of life of our products, our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours. Our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents.We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and strategic partners. We also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies, documentation and other proprietary information. Despite these efforts, internal or external parties may attempt to copy, disclose, obtain or use our products or technology without our authorization. Also, former employees may seek employment with our business partners, customers or competitors, and may improperly use our proprietary information at their employer. If we fail to comply with U.S. and foreign laws related to privacy, data security and data protection, it could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. We are or may become subject to a variety of laws and regulations such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), China’s Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL), or California’s Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) regarding privacy, data protection and data security. These laws and regulations are continuously evolving and developing. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly with respect to foreign laws.In particular, there are numerous U.S. federal, state, and local laws and regulations and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy and the collection, sharing, use, processing, disclosure, and protection of personal data. Such laws and regulations often vary in scope, may be subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent among different jurisdictions. For example, the GDPR and PIPL include operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the European Union or China, as applicable, that are broader and more stringent than those in many other jurisdictions around the world. The GDPR includes significant penalties for non-compliance, and China’s PIPL imposes additional operational requirements relating to processing personal information and provides comprehensive penalty and enforcement mechanisms. In the United States, California enacted the CCPA that requires covered companies to provide additional disclosures and data rights to data subjects, including employees. The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020. The California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), which will become enforceable in March 2024, expands the CCPA and establishes the California Privacy Protection Agency to enforce Californians’ privacy rights under the CCPA. Since the CCPA was enacted, other states, including Virginia and Colorado, have enacted or are in the process of enacting comprehensive privacy schemes. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the GDPR, CCPA and similar laws may limit the use and adoption of our products and services and require us to incur substantial compliance costs, which could have an adverse impact on our business. Further, our product offerings in the digital healthcare solutions space, which include the collection and 18processing of sensitive personal information, subject us to heightened requirements under data privacy laws, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Given that the scope, interpretation and application of these laws and regulations are often uncertain and may be in conflict across jurisdictions, it is possible that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices. Any failure or perceived failure by us or third-party service providers to comply with our privacy or security policies or privacy-related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personal data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation or negative publicity, and could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.We are occasionally involved in litigation, administrative proceedings, and regulatory proceedings, which could be costly to resolve and could require us to redesign products, pay significant royalties or fines or refrain from engaging in specific conduct. From time to time, we are involved in various legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands and investigations relating to our business, including inquiries from and discussions with government entities regarding the compliance of our contracting and sales practices with laws and regulations, which may result in claims with respect to commercial, product liability, intellectual property, cybersecurity, privacy, data protection, antitrust, breach of contract, employment, class action, whistleblower, mergers and acquisitions and other matters. We could also be subject to litigation or arbitration disputes arising under our contractual obligations, customer indemnity, warranty or product liability claims, or other matters that could lead to significant costs and expenses as we defend those claims or pay damage awards. For example, in March 2022, a putative class action was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware against us and the former directors of Maxim as described in Part I, Item 3, “Legal Proceedings.” Further, the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights. Other companies or individuals have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes, and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling infringing products, if those patents are found to be valid and infringed by us. In the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property, and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement.These matters can be time-consuming, divert management’s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. Allegations made in the course of regulatory or legal proceedings may also harm our reputation, regardless of whether there is merit to such claims. Because litigation and the outcome of regulatory proceedings are inherently unpredictable, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially affected by one or more of these proceedings, claims, demands or investigations. There can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities, and we may elect to self-insure with respect to certain matters. An adverse outcome in litigation or arbitration could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or on our operating results or cash flows.Environmental, social and governance matters may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and damage our brand and reputation. There is an increasing focus from regulators, investors, customers, employees and potential talent, as well as other stakeholders, concerning ESG matters, including climate change and sustainability, human rights, support for local communities, Board of Directors and employee diversity, human capital management, employee health and safety practices, product quality, worker rights, supply chain management and corporate governance and transparency. If our ESG practices fail to meet the expectations of investors, customers, employees or other stakeholders’ evolving standards, our reputation, brand and employee retention may be negatively impacted, and our customers and suppliers may be unwilling to continue to do business with us. Current and prospective investors are increasingly utilizing ESG data to inform their decisions, including investment and voting decisions, using a multitude of evolving score and rating frameworks. Further, customers utilize ESG data to inform their purchasing decisions. Additionally, public interest and legislative and regulatory pressure related to companies’ ESG practices, including those related to sourcing practices, carbon emissions and human rights protections, continue to grow. This will require us to align our programs to such expectations and disclose an increasing amount of information and data to illustrate our position and progress and to support our customers to comply with regulations and other requirements. If we do not adapt our strategy or execution quickly enough to meet evolving regulatory requirements or the expectations of our investors, customers, employees, regulators or other stakeholders, or if our ESG disclosures, including data input, processing and reporting, are incomplete or inaccurate, our business, financial condition, results of operations, brand and reputation could be adversely affected.19We are subject to environment, health and safety standards and hazards which have the potential to adversely affect our business, increase our expenses and adversely affect our reputation. Our industry is subject to EHS requirements and laws, particularly those that control and restrict the sourcing, use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage and disposal of certain substances and materials and those that help promote the health and safety of our employees and the communities in which we operate. For certain facilities, we are required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for our operations, which may limit or restrict our operations. In addition, our operations may be interrupted or restricted by the phase-out or ban of certain substances, materials or processes, which may impact the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in manufacturing our products. Further, public attention to environmental and social responsibility remains high, and our customers routinely include stringent environmental and other standards in their contracts with us. Changes in EHS laws, regulations or customer requirements may require us to invest in equipment or make manufacturing process or material changes, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability for damages caused by potential or actual releases of such materials. Any failure to control such materials adequately or to comply with existing or future EHS statutory or regulatory standards, requirements or contractual obligations could result in any of the following, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results:•liability for damages and remediation; •the imposition of regulatory penalties and civil and criminal fines; •the suspension or termination of the development, manufacture, sale or use of certain of our products; •changes to our manufacturing processes or a need to substitute materials that may cost more or be less available;•damage to our reputation; or •increased expenses associated with compliance.If we fail to comply with government contracting regulations, we could suffer a loss of revenue or incur price adjustments or other penalties. Some of our revenue is derived from contracts with agencies of the United States government and subcontracts with its prime contractors. As a United States government contractor or subcontractor, we are subject to federal contracting regulations, including the Federal Acquisition Regulations, which govern the allowability of costs incurred by us in the performance of United States government contracts. Certain contract pricing is based on estimated direct and indirect costs, which are subject to change. Additionally, the United States government is entitled after final payment on certain negotiated contracts to examine all of our cost records with respect to such contracts and to seek a downward adjustment to the price of the contract if it determines that we failed to furnish complete, accurate and current cost or pricing data in connection with the negotiation of the price of the contract. Further, United States government contracts contain provisions and are subject to laws and regulations that may give the United States government rights and remedies not typically found in commercial contracts, including certain intellectual property rights and restrictions on future business.In connection with our United States government business, we are subject to evolving procurement rules and regulations, as well as government audits and to review and approval of our policies, procedures, and internal controls for compliance with procurement regulations and applicable laws, such as the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification. In certain circumstances, if we do not comply with the terms of a government contract or with regulations or statutes, we could be subject to downward contract price adjustments or refund obligations or could in extreme circumstances be assessed civil and criminal penalties or be debarred or suspended from obtaining future contracts for a specified period of time. Any such suspension or debarment or other sanction could have an adverse effect on our business and reputation. Under some of our government subcontracts, we are required to maintain secure facilities and to obtain security clearances for personnel involved in performance of the contract, which can be time consuming and costly. If we are unable to comply with these requirements, or if personnel critical to our performance of these contracts are unable to obtain or maintain their security clearances, we may be unable to perform these contracts or compete for other projects of this nature, which could adversely affect our revenue.Damage to our reputation can damage our business. Our reputation is a critical factor in our relationships with customers, employees, governments, suppliers and other stakeholders. Our failure to address, or the appearance of our failure to address, issues that give rise to reputational risk, including those described in this Risk Factors
 section, could significantly harm our reputation and our brands. We may be subject to reputational risks and our brand loyalty may decline if others adopt the same or confusingly similar marks in an effort to misappropriate and profit on our brand name and do not provide the same level of quality as is delivered by our solutions and 20services. It may also limit our ability to be seen as an employer of choice when competing for highly skilled employees and repairing our reputation and brands may be difficult, time-consuming, and expensive. To the extent we fail to respond quickly and effectively to address corporate and brand crises, the ensuing negative public reaction could significantly harm our reputation and our brands, which could lead to increases in litigation claims and asserted damages or subject us to regulatory actions or restrictions. If we fail to maintain, enhance and protect our brands, if we incur excessive expenses in this effort or if customers or potential customers are confused by others’ trademarks, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. Increases in our effective tax rate, exposure to additional tax liabilities, or substantial changes in domestic or international corporate tax policies, regulations or guidance may adversely impact our results of operations.Our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned. Our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended October 28, 2023 was below the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21%. This is primarily due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income. A number of factors may increase our future effective tax rate, including: new or revised tax laws or legislation or the interpretation of such laws or legislation by governmental authorities; increases in tax rates in various jurisdictions; variation in the mix of jurisdictions in which our profits are earned and taxed; deferred taxes arising from basis differences in investments in foreign subsidiaries; any adverse resolution of ongoing tax audits or adverse rulings from taxing authorities worldwide; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including executive compensation subject to the limitations of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code and amortization of assets acquired in connection with strategic transactions; decreased availability of tax deductions for stock-based compensation awards worldwide; and changes in available tax credits. Any significant increase in our future effective tax rate could adversely impact our net income during future periods. Compliance with tax legislation may require the collection of information not regularly produced by us, and therefore necessitate the use of estimates in our Consolidated Financial Statements and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions. As regulations and guidance evolve with respect to tax legislation, and as more information is gathered and analyzed, our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our Consolidated Financial Statements. We are also subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that determine how much profit has been earned and when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction. In the United States, for example, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) imposes a 15% book minimum tax on corporations with three-year average annual adjusted financial statement income exceeding $1 billion. We do not believe that the IRA will materially impact our effective tax rate. Corporate tax reform, anti-base-erosion rules and tax transparency continue to be high legislative or regulatory priorities in many jurisdictions. Changes in laws and regulations regarding these matters, including those that align to or are associated with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Actions Plans, could impact the jurisdictions where we are deemed to earn income, which could in turn adversely affect our tax liability and results of operations. Risks Related to Financial Markets, Indebtedness and Capital ReturnWe have substantial existing indebtedness and the ability to incur significant additional indebtedness, which could limit our operations and our use of our cash flow and negatively impact our credit ratings. As of October 28, 2023, we had approximately $6.9 billion in outstanding indebtedness, including $0.5 billion of short-term commercial paper. In addition, we had the ability to incur approximately $2.0 billion of additional indebtedness in direct borrowings under our outstanding commercial paper facility based on amounts available under our unsecured revolving credit facility that were not being used to backstop our outstanding commercial paper balance. Our leverage could have negative consequences, including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, limiting our ability to obtain additional financing and limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through strategic acquisitions. Further, on October 5, 2021, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes (Floating Rate Notes). Our Floating Rate Notes and our net interest expense is exposed to changes in market interest rates and will increase as market interest rates rise. We may also incur additional debt, including debt with variable interest rates, in the future, which would exacerbate these risks.Our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness when due depends upon our future operating performance, which may be impacted by general economic conditions, industry cycles and other factors beyond our control. If we are unable to service or refinance our debt, we may be required to divert funds that would otherwise be invested in growing our business operations or returned to shareholders, repatriate earnings as dividends from foreign locations with potential negative tax consequences, or sell selected assets. Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt, which could negatively impact our financial results. In addition, we may not be able to obtain any such financing, refinancing or 21complete a sale of assets on economically favorable terms. In the case of financing or refinancing, favorable interest rates will depend on conditions in the debt capital markets. In addition, if our credit ratings are downgraded or put on watch for a potential downgrade, the applicable interest rate on borrowings under our current revolving credit facility and commercial paper issuances may rise and our ability to obtain additional financing or refinance our existing debt may be negatively affected.Restrictions in our revolving credit facility and outstanding debt instruments may limit our activities. Our current revolving credit facility and outstanding debt instruments impose, and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may impose, restrictions that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit us, including to undertake certain transactions, to create certain liens on our assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness. Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as changes in technology, government regulations and the level of competition in our markets. In addition, our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. If we breach any of the covenants under our revolving credit facility, the indentures governing our outstanding senior unsecured notes, or any future debt instruments to which we may become subject and do not obtain appropriate waivers, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness thereunder could be declared immediately due and payable and we may be restricted from further borrowing under our revolving credit facility.We may not meet expectations or targets in connection with our “green” financing arrangements, which could harm our reputation and business. From time to time, we may enter into “green” financing arrangements that require us to use proceeds for environmental sustainability purposes or have targets related to environmental sustainability. For example, we entered into a revolving credit agreement on June 23, 2021, which, as amended, contains a sustainability-linked pricing component, which provides for interest rate and facility fee reductions or increases based on meeting or missing targets related to environmental sustainability, specifically greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy usage. For calendar year 2022, we were within the threshold range for greenhouse gas emissions and exceeded the target threshold for renewable energy usage related to this sustainability-linked pricing component. On October 5, 2021, we issued $750 million sustainability-linked senior notes (Sustainability-Linked Senior Notes). Our Sustainability-Linked Senior Notes initially bear interest at a rate of 1.7% per annum and are subject to an increase of an additional 30 basis points per annum from April 1, 2026 to their maturity on October 1, 2028 unless the Sustainability Performance Target (as defined in the Sustainability-Linked Senior Notes) has been satisfied. Failing to use the net proceeds under green financing arrangements that satisfies investor criteria and expectations regarding environmental impact or achieve targets related to environmental sustainability under such financing arrangements could result in reputational harm and our business and operating results could be negatively impacted.If we are not able to meet our U.S. cash requirements, it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of foreign earnings, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.We carry outside basis differences in certain of our subsidiaries, primarily arising from acquisition accounting adjustments and certain undistributed earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested. We intend to reinvest these funds in our international operations, and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings to fund our U.S. cash requirements. We require a substantial amount of cash in the United States for operating requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends and acquisitions. If we are not able to meet our U.S. cash requirements through operations, borrowings under our current revolving credit facility, issuances under our commercial paper program, future debt or equity offerings or other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost, it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of earnings that are indefinitely reinvested, and we may be required to pay additional taxes under current tax laws, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.General Risk Factors
Our results of operations could be affected by natural disasters or other catastrophic events in the locations in which we operate. We, like many companies in the semiconductor industry, rely on supplies, services, internal manufacturing capacity, wafer fabrication foundries and other subcontractors in locations around the world that are susceptible to natural disasters and other significant disruptions. Earthquakes, fires, tsunamis, flooding, public health emergencies or other catastrophic events may disrupt local semiconductor-related businesses and adversely affect manufacturing capacity, availability and cost of key raw materials, utilities and equipment, and availability of key services, including transport of our products worldwide. Our insurance may not adequately cover losses resulting from such disruptions. Any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities, or those of our subcontractors or third-party wafer fabrication foundries, as a result of fire, flood, natural disaster, unavailability of utilities or otherwise, could result in a temporary or permanent loss of customers for affected products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, global 22climate change may result in certain natural disasters or other severe weather events occurring more frequently or with greater intensity, such as drought, wildfires, storms, sea-level rise, extreme temperatures and flooding, and could disrupt the availability of water necessary for the operation of our fabrication facilities. The long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the semiconductor industry in particular are unclear, but could be severe. The extent to which the novel strain of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic will adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations is uncertain. The COVID-19 pandemic created significant worldwide uncertainty, volatility and economic disruption and impacted our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers, those of our respective vendors and suppliers and the global capital markets. During the course of the pandemic, many of the countries in which we operate took and may continue to take measures to address the pandemic, which at times has resulted and may continue to result in disruptions at some of our manufacturing operations and facilities, including restrictions on our access to facilities. We may also be required to take actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, and suppliers, which may cause disruption to our business. The COVID-19 pandemic could also cause further disruption in our supply chain and customer demand, and could adversely affect the ability of our customers to perform, including in making timely payments to us, which could further impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, it may also heighten many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors
” section.Our stock price may be volatile. The market price of our common stock may be volatile, as it may be significantly affected by factors including:•global economic conditions generally;•crises in global credit, debt and financial markets;•actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and operating results;•changes in financial estimates or other statements made by securities analysts or others in analyst reports or other publications, or our failure to perform in line with those estimates or statements or our published guidance;•financial results and prospects of our customers;•U.S. and foreign government actions, including with respect to trade, travel, export and taxation; •changes in market valuations of other semiconductor companies;•rumors and speculation in the press, investment community or on social media about us, our customers or other companies in our industry;•announcements by us, our customers or our competitors of significant new products, technical innovations, material transactions, acquisitions or dispositions, litigation, capital commitments, including share repurchases and dividend policies, or revised earnings estimates;•departures of key personnel;•alleged noncompliance with laws, regulations or ethics standards by us or any of our employees, officers or directors; and•negative media publicity targeting us or our suppliers, customers or competitors.The stock market has historically experienced volatility, especially within the semiconductor industry, that often has been unrelated to the performance of particular companies, such as the response to rising inflation and increasing interest rates. These market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless of our operating results.Our directors and executive officers periodically buy or sell shares of our common stock in the market, including pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. Regardless of the individual's reasons for such purchases or sales, securities analysts and investors could view such transactions as positive or negative indicators and our stock price could be adversely affected as a result"
3,ADI,ANALOG DEVICES,2022-11-22,"ITEM 1A.         RISK FACTORSSet forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are descriptions of certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements in this report. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also adversely affect our business. Risks Related to our Business, Operations, Industry and PartnersGlobal political and economic uncertainty and adverse conditions related to our international operations could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We have significant operations and manufacturing facilities outside the United States, including in Ireland, the Philippines, Thailand, and Malaysia. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from customers in international markets, and we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the future. As a result of our international operations, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted by the following:•political, legal and economic changes, crises or instability and civil unrest in markets in which we do business, such as potential macroeconomic weakness related to trade and political disputes between the United States and China,  changes in China-Taiwan relations that may adversely affect our operations in Taiwan, our customers, and the technology industry supply chain, the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, the implementation of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement and the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine;•compliance requirements of U.S. customs and export regulations, including the Export Administration Regulations and the International Traffic and Arms Regulations;•currency conversion risks and exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations, including the potential impact of the transition from LIBOR and the current increasing interest rate environment;•instability of global credit and financial markets due to adverse macroeconomic conditions such as rising inflation, increasing interest rates and slower economic growth or recession that could, among other impacts, affect our ability to access external financing sources on acceptable terms or lead to financial difficulties or uncertainty of our customers, suppliers and distributors exposing us to late payments, cancelled orders and inventory challenges, among others;•trade policy, commercial, travel, export or taxation disputes or restrictions, import or export tariffs, changes to export classifications or other restrictions imposed by the U.S. government or by the governments of the countries in which we do business, particularly in China; •sanctions imposed by governments in countries in which we do business, including those imposed on Russia by, among others, the European Union, the U.S. and the United Kingdom in response to the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which sanctions restrict a wide range of trade and financial dealings with Russian and Russian persons, as well as certain regions in Ukraine; •complex, varying and changing government regulations and legal standards and requirements, particularly with respect to tax regulations, price protection, competition practices, export control regulations and restrictions, customs and tax requirements, immigration, anti-boycott regulations, data privacy, cyber security, sustainability and climate-related regulations, intellectual property, anti-corruption and environmental compliance, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;•economic disruption from terrorism and threats of terrorism and the response to them by the U.S. and its allies;•increased managerial complexities, including different employment practices and labor issues;•changes in immigration laws, regulations and procedures and enforcement practices of various government agencies;•greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting such rights;•natural disasters or public health emergencies, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic;•transportation disruptions and delays and increases in labor and transportation costs;•changes to foreign taxes, tariffs and freight rates;•fluctuations in raw material costs and energy costs due to general market factors and conditions such as inflation and supply chain constraints; •greater difficulty in accounts receivable collections and longer collection periods; and•increased costs associated with our foreign defined benefit pension plans.11Many of these factors and risks are present within our business operations in China. For example, changes in U.S.-China relations, the political environment or international trade policies and relations could result in further revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of import or export duties and tariffs, restrictions on imports or exports, currency revaluations, or retaliatory actions, which have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results. In addition, expanded export restrictions  limit our ability to sell to certain Chinese companies and to third parties that do business with those companies. These restrictions have created and may continue to create uncertainty and caution with our current or prospective customers and may cause them to amass large inventories of our products, replace our products with products from another supplier that is not subject to the export restrictions, or focus on building indigenous semiconductor capacity to reduce reliance on U.S. suppliers. Furthermore, if these export restrictions cause our current or potential customers to view U.S. companies as unreliable, we could suffer reputational damage or lose business to foreign competitors who are not subject to such export restrictions, and our business could be materially harmed. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of these restrictions on our business, but these actions may have direct and indirect adverse impacts on our revenues and results of operations in China and elsewhere. In addition, our success in the Chinese markets may be adversely affected by China’s continuously evolving policies, laws and regulations, including those relating to antitrust, cybersecurity, data protection and data privacy, the environment, indigenous innovation and the promotion of a domestic semiconductor industry, and intellectual property rights and enforcement and protection of those rights. We rely on third parties for supply of raw materials and parts, semiconductor wafer foundry services, assembly and test services, and transportation, among other things, and we generally cannot control their availability or conditions of supply or services. We rely, and plan to continue to rely, on third-party suppliers and service providers, including raw material and components suppliers, semiconductor wafer foundries, assembly and test contractors, and freight carriers (collectively, vendors) in manufacturing our products. This reliance involves several risks, including reduced control over availability, capacity utilization, delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, costs, and supply chain allocations. We currently source more than half of our wafer requirements annually from third-party wafer foundries, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and others. These foundries often provide wafer foundry services to our competitors and therefore periods of increased industry demand may result in capacity constraints. With respect to TSMC in particular, geopolitical changes in China-Taiwan relations could disrupt TSMC’s operations, which would adversely affect our ability to manufacture certain products and as a result, could adversely affect our business and results of operations.Our manufacturing processes require availability of certain raw materials and supplies. Limited or delayed access to these items could adversely affect our results of operations. In certain instances, one of our vendors may be the sole source of highly specialized processing services or materials. If such vendor is unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver components to us on the time schedule and of the quality or quantity that we require, we may be forced to seek to engage an additional or replacement vendor, which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers. If additional or replacement vendors are not available, we may also experience delays in product development or shipment which could, in turn, result in the temporary or permanent loss of customers and as a result could adversely affect our business and results of operations.The markets for semiconductor products are cyclical, and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices, and conversely, we may not be able to satisfy unexpected demand for our products. The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly. The demand for our products is subject to the strength of our four major end markets of Industrial, Automotive, Communications, and Consumer. If we expand our operations and workforce too rapidly or procure excessive resources in anticipation of increased demand for our products, and that demand does not materialize at the pace at which we expect, or declines, or if we overbuild inventory in a period of decreased demand, our operating results may be adversely affected as a result of increased operating expenses, reduced margins, underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges. These capacity expansions by us and other semiconductor manufacturers could also lead to overcapacity in our target markets which could lead to price erosion that could adversely impact our operating results. Conversely, during periods of rapid increases in demand, our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy the demand. In addition, we may not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner, procure adequate resources and raw materials, locate suitable third-party suppliers, or respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to demand for new products requested by our customers, and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected.12A prolonged disruption of our internal manufacturing operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition to leveraging an outsourcing model for manufacturing operations, we also rely on our internal manufacturing operations located in the United States, Ireland, the Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia. A prolonged disruption at, or inability to utilize, one or more of our manufacturing facilities, loss of raw materials or damage to our manufacturing equipment for any reason, including due to the COVID-19 pandemic, natural or man-made disasters, civil unrest or other events outside of our control, such as widespread outbreaks of illness, or the failure to maintain our labor force at one or more of these facilities, may disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in us being unable to timely satisfy customer demand. As a result, we could forgo revenue opportunities, potentially lose market share and damage our customer relationships, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our future success depends upon our ability to execute our business strategy, continue to innovate, improve our existing products, design, develop, produce and market new products, and identify and enter new markets. Our future success significantly depends on our ability to execute our business strategy, continue to innovate, improve our existing products, and design, develop, produce and market innovative new products and system-level solutions.  Product design, development, innovation and enhancement is often a complex, time-consuming and costly process involving significant investment in research and development with no assurance of return on investment. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new and improved products in a timely or efficient manner or that new and improved products, if developed, will achieve market acceptance. Our products generally must conform to various evolving and sometimes competing industry standards, which may adversely affect our ability to compete in certain markets or require us to incur significant costs. In addition, our customers generally impose very high quality and reliability standards on our products, which often change and may be difficult or costly to satisfy. Any inability to satisfy customer quality and reliability standards or comply with industry standards and technical requirements may adversely affect demand for our products and our results of operations. Our growth is also dependent on our ability to identify and penetrate new markets where we have limited experience yet require significant investments, resources and technological advancements in order to compete effectively, and there can be no assurance that we will achieve success in these markets. There can be no assurance that the markets we serve and/or target based on our business strategy will grow in the future, that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets, that our products, or the end-products in which our products are used, will achieve customer acceptance in these markets, that competitors will not force price reductions or take market share from us, or that we can achieve or maintain adequate gross margins or profits in these markets.Our future revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate. Our future revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors, including:•the effects of adverse economic conditions in the markets in which we sell our products, including inflationary pressures, which has resulted, and may continue to result, in increased interest rates, fuel prices, wages, and other costs;•changes in customer demand or order patterns for our products and/or for end products that incorporate our products;•the timing, delay, reduction or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability to manage inventory;•our ability to accurately forecast distributor demand for our products;•future distributor pricing credits and/or stock rotation rights;•our ability to effectively manage our cost structure in both the short term and over a longer duration;•changes in geographic, product or customer mix;•the extent of the impact and the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic;•changes in our effective tax rates or new or revised tax legislation in the United States, Ireland or worldwide; •the effects of issued, threatened or retaliatory government sanctions, trade barriers or economic restrictions; changes in law, regulations or other restrictions, including executive orders; and changes in import and export regulations, including restrictions on exports to certain companies or to third parties that do business with such companies, export classifications, or duties and tariffs, particularly with respect to China; •the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us, our customers or our competitors and the market acceptance of such products;•pricing decisions and competitive pricing pressures;13•fluctuations in manufacturing yields, adequate availability of wafers and other raw materials, and manufacturing, assembly and test capacity;•the ability of our third-party suppliers, subcontractors and manufacturers to supply us with sufficient quantities of raw materials, products and/or components;•a decline in infrastructure spending by foreign governments, including China;•a decline in the U.S. government defense budget, changes in spending or budgetary priorities, a prolonged U.S. government shutdown or delays in contract awards;•a decline in our backlog;•our ability to recruit, hire, retain and motivate adequate numbers of engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of our customers;•our ability to generate new design opportunities and win competitive bid selection processes;•the increasing costs of providing employee benefits worldwide, including health insurance, retirement plan and pension plan contributions and retirement benefits; •our ability to utilize our manufacturing facilities at efficient levels;•fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;•potential litigation-related costs or product liability, warranty and/or indemnity claims, including those not covered by our suppliers or insurers;•the difficulties inherent in forecasting future operating expense levels, including with respect to costs associated with labor, utilities, transportation and raw materials;•the costs related to compliance with increasing worldwide government, environmental and social responsibility standards; •new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting standards and practices; and•the effects of public health emergencies, civil unrest, natural disasters, widespread travel disruptions, security risks, terrorist activities, international conflicts and other events beyond our control.In addition, the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic upturns and downturns. Our business and certain of the end markets we serve are also subject to rapid technological changes and material fluctuations in demand based on end-user preferences. There can be no assurance (i) that products stocked in our inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them, or (ii) that we will be able to design, develop and produce products in a timely fashion to accommodate changing customer demand.  As a result of these and other factors, we may experience material fluctuations in future revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share on a quarterly or annual basis. Our historical financial performance and results of operations should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance or results. In addition, if our revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share results or expectations do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the market price of our common stock may decline.We may not be able to compete successfully in markets within the semiconductor industry in the future. We face intense competition in the semiconductor industry, and we expect this competition to increase in the future, including from companies located outside of the United States. Competition is generally based on innovation, design, quality and reliability of products, product performance, features and functionality, product pricing, availability and capacity, technological service and support, and the availability of integrated system solutions, with the relative importance of these factors varying among products, markets and customers. Many companies have sufficient financial, manufacturing, technical, sales and marketing resources to develop and market products that compete with our products. Some of our competitors may have more advantageous supply or development relationships with our current and potential customers or suppliers. Our competitors also include both emerging companies selling specialized products in markets we serve and companies outside of the U.S., including entities associated with well-funded efforts by foreign governments to create indigenous semiconductor industries. Existing or new competitors may develop products or technologies that more effectively address the demands of our customers and markets with enhanced performance, features and functionality, lower power requirements, greater levels of integration or lower cost. In addition, as we seek to expand our business, including the design and production of products and services for developing and emerging markets, we may encounter increased competition from our current competitors and/or new competitors. Increased competition in certain markets has resulted in and may continue to result in declining average selling prices, reduced gross margins and loss of market share in those markets. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors, or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased competition. In addition, the semiconductor industry has experienced significant consolidation over the 14past several years.  Consolidation among our competitors could lead to a changing competitive landscape, which could negatively impact our competitive position and market share and harm our results of operations.If we are unable to recruit or retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our business strategy will be adversely affected. Our continued success depends to a significant extent upon the recruitment, retention and effective succession of our key personnel, including our leadership team, management and technical personnel, particularly our experienced engineers. The competition for these employees is intense and the labor market is tight.  Further, we have recently experienced an increase in undesired attrition. The loss of key personnel or the inability to attract, timely hire and retain key employees with critical technical skills to achieve our strategy, including as a result of changes to immigration policies, could cause business disruptions, increased expenses to address any disruptions, and could have a material adverse effect on our business. We believe that a critical contributor to our success to date has been our corporate culture, which we have built to foster innovation, teamwork and employee satisfaction. As we grow, including from the integration of employees and businesses acquired in connection with previous or future acquisitions, we may find it difficult to maintain important aspects of our corporate culture, which could negatively affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel who are essential to our future success.We do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or other employees. The loss of one or more of our key employees, and any failure to have in place and execute an effective succession plan for key executives, could seriously harm our business.Our customers typically do not make long-term product purchase commitments, and incorrect forecasts or reductions, cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results. We typically do not have sales contracts with our customers that include long-term product purchase commitments. In certain markets where end-user demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict, some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment, even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all, or even any, of the product. In other instances, we manufacture product based on non-binding forecasts of customer demands, which may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis and at times may prove to be inaccurate. Additionally, our U.S. government contracts and subcontracts may be funded in increments over a number of government budget periods and typically can be terminated by the government for its convenience. As a result, we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales, and we are subject to the risk of lower than expected orders or cancellations of orders, leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog. Further, if orders or forecasts for products that meet a customer’s unique requirements are canceled or unrealized we may be left with an inventory of unsaleable products, causing potential inventory write-offs, and hindering our ability to recover our costs. As a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the products that are subject to these uncertainties, the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial. Incorrect forecasts, or reductions, cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results.Our operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors. A significant portion of our sales are through independent global and regional distributors that are not under our control. These independent distributors generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts for our products or they could terminate their representation of us. We generally do not require letters of credit from our distributors, including our largest distributor, and are not protected against accounts receivable default or declarations of bankruptcy by these distributors. Our inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our operating results. Termination of a significant distributor or a group of distributors, whether at our initiative or the distributor’s initiative or through consolidation in the distribution industry, could disrupt our current business, and if we are unable to find suitable replacements with the appropriate scale and resources, our operating results could be adversely affected.We are required to estimate the effects of returns and allowances provided to distributors and record revenue at the time of sale to the distributor.  If our estimates of such credits and rights are materially understated, it could cause subsequent adjustments that negatively impact our revenues and gross profits in a future period.Our industry faces challenges associated with products diverted from authorized distribution channels, which could result in reputational harm and have a material adverse effect our business and results of operations. We market and sell our products directly and through third-party distributors.  There is a risk that our products may be diverted from our authorized distribution channels and sold on the “gray market” in ways that are not in accordance with our established agreements, policies and procedures or at our established prices.  Customers purchasing our products on the gray market or through other unauthorized channels may use our products for purposes for which they were not intended or that may be contrary to our ethical, legal and regulatory obligations.  Customers may also purchase counterfeit or substandard products, including products that have been altered, mishandled or damaged, or purchase used products presented as new, each of which 15could result in damage to property or persons.  Further, sales through unauthorized channels could result in our products being sold at prices that are not our established prices and could result in lost revenue. These situations could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. The extent to which the novel strain of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic will adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations is uncertain. The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant worldwide uncertainty, volatility and economic disruption and has impacted our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers, those of our respective vendors and suppliers and the global capital markets. During the course of the pandemic, many of the countries in which we operate took and continue to take measures to address the pandemic, which at times has resulted in disruptions at some of our manufacturing operations and facilities, including restrictions on our access to facilities. We may also continue to take actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, and suppliers, which may cause disruption to our business.  The continued COVID-19 pandemic could also cause further disruption in our supply chain and customer demand, and could adversely affect the ability of our customers to perform, including in making timely payments to us, which could further impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows continues to be largely dependent on future developments, including the duration, scope and severity of the pandemic, any additional resurgences, variants and severity of variants and the ability to effectively and widely manufacture and distribute vaccines, which are not within our control and cannot be accurately predicted and are uncertain. These events could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, it may also heighten many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors
” section.Our semiconductor products are complex and we may be subject to warranty, indemnity and/or product liability claims, which could result in significant costs and damage to our reputation and adversely affect customer relationships, the market acceptance of our products and our operating results. Semiconductor products are highly complex and may contain defects that affect their quality or performance. Failures in our products and services or in the products of our customers could result in damage to our reputation for reliability and increase our legal or financial exposure to third parties. Certain of our products and services could also contain security vulnerabilities, defects, bugs and errors, which could also result in significant data losses, security breaches and theft of intellectual property. We generally warrant that our products will meet their published specifications, and that we will repair or replace defective products, for one year from the date title passes from us to the customer. We invest significant resources in the testing of our products; however, if any of our products contain defects, we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders. These problems may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or others, including liability for costs and expenses associated with product defects, including recalls, which may adversely impact our operating results. We may also be subject to customer intellectual property indemnity claims. Our customers have on occasion been sued, and may be sued in the future, by third parties alleging infringement of intellectual property rights, or damages resulting from use of our products. Those customers may seek indemnification from us under the terms and conditions of our sales contracts with them. In certain cases, our potential indemnification liability may be significant. Further, we sell to customers in industries such as automotive (including autonomous vehicles), aerospace, defense, and healthcare, where failure of the systems in which our products are integrated could cause damage to property or persons. We may be subject to product liability claims if our products, or the integration of our products, cause system failures. Any product liability claim, whether or not determined in our favor, could result in significant expense, divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, and harm our business. In addition, if any of our products contain defects, or have reliability, quality or compatibility problems not capable of being resolved, our reputation may be damaged, which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to customers and which could also adversely affect our operating results. The fabrication of integrated circuits is highly complex and precise, and our manufacturing processes utilize a substantial amount of technology. Minute impurities, contaminants in the manufacturing environment, difficulties in the fabrication process, defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process, manufacturing equipment failures, wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional. While we have significant expertise in semiconductor manufacturing, it is possible that some processes could become unstable. This instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.16Risk Related to Acquisitions and Strategic Transactions Our acquisition of Maxim involves a number of risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals we anticipate. In August 2021, we completed our acquisition of Maxim, which we refer to as the acquisition or the merger. The ultimate success of the merger will depend on, among other things, the ability to continue to combine the two businesses in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities. Further, there are a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that must continue to be integrated in connection with the ongoing integration of Maxim’s business. The combined company has and may continue to incur ongoing restructuring, integration, and other costs associated with combining the operations of the two companies in connection with the merger. It is possible that the ongoing integration process could result in the loss of customers, the disruption of ongoing businesses, inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies, unexpected integration issues, higher than expected integration costs and an overall integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated and actual growth, if achieved, may be lower than what we expect and may take longer to achieve than anticipated. There can be no assurances that the two businesses can be integrated successfully in a way that maximizes the combined business to the fullest extent. If we are not able to successfully achieve our objectives, the benefits of the merger may not be fully realized or may take longer to achieve than expected. To remain competitive, we may need to invest in or acquire other companies, purchase or license technology from third parties, or enter into other strategic transactions in order to introduce new products or enhance our existing products. An element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisitions of businesses, assets, products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings, diversify our product portfolio, expand our market coverage, increase our engineering workforce, expand our technical skill sets or enhance our technological capabilities. We may not be able to find businesses that have the technology or resources we need and, if we find such businesses, we may not be able to invest in, purchase or license the technology or resources on commercially favorable terms or at all. Acquisitions, investments and technology licenses are challenging to complete for a number of reasons, including difficulties in identifying potential targets, the cost of potential transactions, competition among prospective buyers and licensees, the need for regulatory approvals, and difficulties related to integration efforts. In addition, investments in companies are subject to a risk of a partial or total loss of our investment. Both in the U.S. and abroad, governmental regulation of acquisitions, including antitrust and other regulatory reviews and approvals, has become more complex, increasing the costs and risks of undertaking and consummating significant acquisitions. In order to finance a potential transaction, we may need to raise additional funds by issuing securities or borrowing money. We may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms, and the sale of our stock may result in the dilution of our existing shareholders or the issuance of securities with rights that are superior to the rights of our common shareholders.Acquisitions also involve a number of challenges and risks, including:•diversion of management’s attention in connection with both negotiating the transaction and integrating the acquired assets and businesses;•difficulty or delay integrating acquired technologies, operations, systems and infrastructure, and personnel with our existing businesses;•strain on managerial and operational resources as management tries to oversee larger or more complex operations;•the future funding requirements for acquired companies, including research and development costs, employee compensation and benefits, and operating expenses, which may be significant;•servicing significant debt that may be incurred in connection with acquisitions; •potential loss of key employees;•exposure to unforeseen liabilities or regulatory compliance issues of acquired companies; •higher than expected or unexpected costs relating to or associated with an acquisition and related integration of assets and businesses;•difficulty realizing expected cost savings, operating synergies and growth prospects of an acquisition in a timely manner or at all; and•increased risk of costly and time-consuming legal proceedings.If we are unable to successfully address these risks, we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of our acquisitions, which may have an adverse effect on our business strategy, plans and operating results.17Risks Related to Cyber, IP, Legal and Regulatory Our computer systems and networks may be subject to attempted security breaches and other cybersecurity incidents and a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems or certain of our products could materially and adversely affect our business or reputation. We rely on information technology systems throughout our company to keep financial records and customer data, process orders, manage inventory, coordinate shipments to customers, maintain confidential and proprietary information, assist in semiconductor engineering and other technical activities and operate other critical functions such as Internet connectivity, network communications and email. Our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, employee malfeasance, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, some of our employees have been working remotely, which may pose additional data security risks. We also rely upon external cloud providers for certain infrastructure activities. If we were to experience a prolonged disruption in the information technology systems that involve our internal communications or our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business. We may also be subject to security breaches of our information technology systems and certain of our products caused by viruses, illegal break-ins or hacking, sabotage, other cyber attacks, or acts of vandalism by third parties or our employees or contractors. Further, geopolitical tensions or conflicts, such as the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, may create a heightened risk of cyber attacks, which could result in significant losses and damage and, could damage our reputation with customers and suppliers if the confidential information of our customers, suppliers, employees or contractors is compromised. Our security measures or those of our third-party service providers may not detect or prevent security breaches, cyber attacks, defects, bugs or errors.  In addition, we provide our confidential and proprietary information to our strategic partners in certain cases where doing so is necessary to conduct our business.  Those third parties may be subject to security breaches or otherwise compromise the protection of such information.  Security breaches of our information technology systems or those of our partners could result in the misappropriation, loss or unauthorized disclosure of confidential and proprietary information belonging to us or to our employees, contractors, partners, customers, suppliers, or other third parties, system disruptions or denial of service, which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage.In the event of such breaches, we could be exposed to potential liability, litigation, and regulatory action, as well as the loss of existing or potential customers, damage to our reputation, and other financial loss. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of responding to breaches and implementing remediation measures could be significant.We may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary intellectual property rights, which may limit our ability to compete effectively. Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We primarily rely on patent, mask work, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure agreements, information security practices, and other methods, to protect our proprietary information, technologies and processes. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain or disclose our confidential information, reverse engineer or copy our technologies, products or processes, make unlicensed copies or engage in unapproved distributions of our technology for unauthorized uses, or otherwise misappropriate our intellectual property. Moreover, the laws of foreign countries in which we design, manufacture, market and sell our products may afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property.There can be no assurance that the claims allowed in our issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. In addition, any of our existing or future patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. As such, any rights granted under these patents may not prevent others from exploiting our proprietary technology. We may not be able to obtain foreign patents or pending applications corresponding to our U.S. patents and applications. Even if patents are granted, we may not be able to effectively enforce our rights. If our patents and mask works do not adequately protect our technology, or if our registrations expire prior to end of life of our products, our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours. Our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents.We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and strategic partners. We also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies, documentation and other proprietary information. Despite these efforts, internal or external parties may attempt to copy, disclose, obtain or use our products or technology without our authorization. Also, former employees may seek employment with our business partners, customers or competitors, and may improperly use our proprietary information at their employer. 18If we fail to comply with U.S. and foreign laws related to privacy, data security, and data protection, it could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. We are or may become subject to a variety of laws and regulations such as the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”), China’s Personal Information Protection Law (the “PIPL”), or California’s Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”) regarding privacy, data protection, and data security. These laws and regulations are continuously evolving and developing. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to us are often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly with respect to foreign laws.In particular, there are numerous U.S. federal, state, and local laws and regulations and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy and the collection, sharing, use, processing, disclosure, and protection of personal data. Such laws and regulations often vary in scope, may be subject to differing interpretations, and may be inconsistent among different jurisdictions. For example, the GDPR includes operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the European Union that are broader and more stringent than those in many other jurisdictions around the world.  The GDPR includes significant penalties for non-compliance, and China’s PIPL imposes additional operational requirements relating to processing personal information and provides compressive penalty and enforcement mechanisms. Most notably, in the United States, California enacted the CCPA that requires covered companies to provide additional disclosures and data rights to data subjects. The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020. The California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) passed by voters in November 2020 will expand the CCPA when the regulations become fully operative on January 1, 2023. The CPRA establishes the California Privacy Protection Agency to enforce Californians’ privacy rights under the CCPA. Since the CCPA was enacted, other states, including Virginia and Colorado, have enacted comprehensive privacy schemes. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the GDPR, CCPA, and similar laws may limit the use and adoption of our products and services and/or require us to incur substantial compliance costs, which could have an adverse impact on our business. Further, our product offerings in the digital healthcare solutions space which include the collection and processing of sensitive personal information subject us to heightened requirements under data privacy laws. Given that the scope, interpretation, and application of these laws and regulations are often uncertain and may be in conflict across jurisdictions, it is possible that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices. Any failure or perceived failure by us or third party service providers to comply with our privacy or security policies or privacy-related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personal data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation, or negative publicity, and could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.We are occasionally involved in litigation, administrative proceedings, and regulatory proceedings, which could be costly to resolve and could require us to redesign products, pay significant royalties or fines, or refrain from engaging in specific conduct. From time to time, we are involved in various legal, administrative and regulatory proceedings, claims, demands and investigations relating to our business, including inquiries from and discussions with government entities regarding the compliance of our contracting and sales practices with laws and regulations which may result in claims with respect to commercial, product liability, intellectual property, cybersecurity, privacy, data protection, antitrust, breach of contract, employment, class action, whistleblower, mergers and acquisitions and other matters.  We could also be subject to litigation or arbitration disputes arising under our contractual obligations, customer indemnity, warranty or product liability claims, or other matters that could lead to significant costs and expenses as we defend those claims or pay damage awards. For example, in March 2022, a putative class action was filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware against us and the former directors of Maxim as described in Part I, Item 3, “Legal Proceedings.” Further, the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights. Other companies or individuals have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes, and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling infringing products, if those patents are found to be valid and infringed by us. In the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property, and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement.These matters can be time-consuming, divert management’s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses. Allegations made in the course of regulatory or legal proceedings may also harm our reputation, regardless of whether there is merit to such claims. Because litigation and the outcome of regulatory proceedings are inherently unpredictable, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of 19one or more of these proceedings, claims, demands or investigations. There can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities, and we may elect to self-insure with respect to certain matters. An adverse outcome in litigation or arbitration could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or on our operating results or cash flows in the period in which the dispute is resolved.Environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and damage our brand and reputation. There is an increasing focus from investors, customers, employees and potential talent, as well as other stakeholders concerning ESG matters, including climate change and sustainability, human rights, support for local communities, Board of Directors and employee diversity, human capital management, employee health and safety practices, product quality, supply chain management, and corporate governance and transparency. Current and prospective investors are increasingly utilizing ESG data to inform their decisions, including investment and voting, using a multitude of evolving score and rating frameworks. Further, customers are also utilizing ESG data to inform their purchasing decisions. Additionally, public interest and legislative pressure related to public companies’ ESG practices continue to grow. If our ESG practices fail to meet the expectations of investors, customers, employees or other stakeholders’ evolving standards, our reputation, brand and employee retention may be negatively impacted, and our customers and suppliers may be unwilling to continue to do business with us. Additionally, there is increasing legislation globally which will require us to align programs to their expectations and disclose an increasing amount of information and data to illustrate our position and progress.  If we do not adapt our strategy or execution quickly enough to meet the evolving expectations of our investors, customers, and regulators, or if our ESG data input, processing and reporting are incomplete or inaccurate, our business, financial condition, results of operations, brand and reputation could be adversely affected.We are subject to environment, health and safety (EHS) standards and hazards which have the potential to adversely affect our business, increase our expenses, and adversely affect our reputation. Our industry is subject to EHS requirements and laws, particularly those that control and restrict the sourcing, use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage and disposal of certain substances and materials used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process and which help ensure the health and safety of our employees.  We are also required to obtain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations. Public attention to environmental sustainability and social responsibility concerns continues to increase, and our customers routinely include stringent environmental and other standards in their contracts with us. Changes in EHS laws or regulations may require us to invest in costly equipment or make manufacturing process changes and may adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products. In particular, climate change concerns and the potential resulting environmental impact may result in new or more stringent EHS laws and regulations that may affect us, our suppliers, and our customers. Such laws or regulations could cause us to incur additional direct costs for compliance or costs to control or reduce our environmental impact through, for example, carbon offsets, as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers, suppliers, or both incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us.  These costs may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.  In addition, we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability for damages caused by potential or actual releases of such materials. Any failure to control such materials adequately or to comply with existing or future EHS statutory or regulatory standards, requirements or contractual obligations could result in any of the following, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results:•liability for damages and remediation; •the imposition of regulatory penalties and civil and criminal fines; •the suspension or termination of the development, manufacture, sale, or use of certain of our products; •changes to our manufacturing processes or a need to substitute materials that may cost more or be less available;•damage to our reputation; and/or •increased expenses associated with compliance.If we fail to comply with government contracting regulations, we could suffer a loss of revenue or incur price adjustments or other penalties. Some of our revenue is derived from contracts with agencies of the United States government and subcontracts with its prime contractors. As a United States government contractor or subcontractor, we are subject to federal contracting regulations, including the Federal Acquisition Regulations, which govern the allowability of costs incurred by us in the performance of United States government contracts. Certain contract pricing is based on estimated direct and indirect costs, which are subject to change. Additionally, the United States government is entitled after final payment on certain negotiated contracts to examine all of our cost records with respect to such contracts and to seek a downward adjustment to the price of the contract if it determines 20that we failed to furnish complete, accurate and current cost or pricing data in connection with the negotiation of the price of the contract. In connection with our United States government business, we are subject to evolving procurement rules and regulations, as well as government audits and to review and approval of our policies, procedures, and internal controls for compliance with procurement regulations and applicable laws, such as the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification. In certain circumstances, if we do not comply with the terms of a government contract or with regulations or statutes, we could be subject to downward contract price adjustments or refund obligations or could in extreme circumstances be assessed civil and criminal penalties or be debarred or suspended from obtaining future contracts for a specified period of time. Any such suspension or debarment or other sanction could have an adverse effect on our business. Under some of our government subcontracts, we are required to maintain secure facilities and to obtain security clearances for personnel involved in performance of the contract, in compliance with applicable federal standards. If we were unable to comply with these requirements, or if personnel critical to our performance of these contracts were unable to obtain or maintain their security clearances, we might be unable to perform these contracts or compete for other projects of this nature, which could adversely affect our revenue.Damage to our reputation can damage our business. Our reputation is a critical factor in our relationships with customers, employees, governments, suppliers, and other stakeholders. Our failure to address, or the appearance of our failure to address, issues that give rise to reputational risk, including those described in this Risk Factors
 section, could significantly harm our reputation and our brands. We may be subject to reputational risks and our brand loyalty may decline if others adopt the same or confusingly similar marks in an effort to misappropriate and profit on our brand name and do not provide the same level of quality as is delivered by our solutions and services. It may also limit our ability to be seen as an employer of choice when competing for highly skilled employees and repairing our reputation and brands may be difficult, time-consuming, and expensive. To the extent we fail to respond quickly and effectively to address corporate and brand crises, the ensuing negative public reaction could significantly harm our reputation and our brands, which could lead to increases in litigation claims and asserted damages or subject us to regulatory actions or restrictions. If we fail to police, maintain, enhance and protect our brands, if we incur excessive expenses in this effort or if customers or potential customers are confused by others’ trademarks, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected. Increases in our effective tax rate, exposure to additional tax liabilities, or substantial changes in domestic or international corporate tax policies, regulations or guidance may adversely impact our results of operations.Our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned. Our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended October 29, 2022 was below the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21%. This is primarily due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income. A number of factors may increase our future effective tax rate, including: new or revised tax laws or legislation or the interpretation of such laws or legislation by governmental authorities; increases in tax rates in various jurisdictions; variation in the mix of jurisdictions in which our profits are earned and taxed; deferred taxes arising from basis differences in investments in foreign subsidiaries; any adverse resolution of ongoing tax audits or adverse rulings from taxing authorities worldwide; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including executive compensation subject to the limitations of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code and amortization of assets acquired in connection with strategic transactions; decreased availability of tax deductions for stock-based compensation awards worldwide; and changes in available tax credits. Any significant increase in our future effective tax rate could adversely impact our net income during future periods. Compliance with tax legislation may require the collection of information not regularly produced by us, and therefore necessitate the use of estimates in our Consolidated Financial Statements and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions. As regulations and guidance evolve with respect to tax legislation, and as more information is gathered and analyzed, our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our Consolidated Financial Statements. We are also subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that determine how much profit has been earned and when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction. On August 16, 2022, the U.S. government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) which imposes a 15% book minimum tax on corporations with three-year average annual adjusted financial statement income exceeding $1 billion. We are in the process of assessing whether the book minimum tax would impact our effective tax rate. Corporate tax reform, anti-base-erosion rules and tax transparency continue to be high priorities in many jurisdictions. Changes in these laws and regulations, including those that align to or are associated with the Organization for Economic 21Cooperation and Development's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Actions Plans, could impact the jurisdictions where we are deemed to earn income, which could in turn adversely affect our tax liability and results of operations. Risks Related to Financial Markets, Indebtedness and Capital ReturnWe have substantial existing indebtedness and the ability to incur significant additional indebtedness, which could limit our operations and our use of our cash flow and negatively impact our credit ratings. As of October 29, 2022, we had approximately $6.5 billion in outstanding indebtedness. In addition, we had $2.5 billion of availability under our unsecured revolving credit facility. Our leverage could have negative consequences, including increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions, limiting our ability to obtain additional financing and limiting our ability to acquire new products and technologies through strategic acquisitions. Further, on October 5, 2021, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes (the “Floating Rate Notes”).  Our Floating Rate Notes and our net interest expense is exposed to changes in market interest rates and will increase as market interest rates rise. We may also incur additional debt, including debt with variable interest rates, in the future, which would increase these risks.Our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness when due depends upon our future operating performance, which may be impacted by general economic conditions, industry cycles and other factors beyond our control.  If we are unable to service or refinance our debt, we may be required to divert funds that would otherwise be invested in growing our business operations or returned to shareholders, repatriate earnings as dividends from foreign locations with potential negative tax consequences, or sell selected assets. Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt, which could negatively impact our financial results. In addition, we may not be able to obtain any such financing, refinancing or complete a sale of assets on economically favorable terms. In the case of financing or refinancing, favorable interest rates will depend on conditions in the debt capital markets. In addition, if our credit ratings are downgraded or put on watch for a potential downgrade, the applicable interest rate on borrowings under our current revolving credit facility may rise and our ability to obtain additional financing or refinance our existing debt may be negatively affected.Restrictions in our revolving credit facility and outstanding debt instruments may limit our activities. Our current revolving credit facility and outstanding debt instruments impose, and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may impose, restrictions that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit us, including to undertake certain transactions, to create certain liens on our assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness. Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as changes in technology, government regulations and the level of competition in our markets. In addition, our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. If we breach any of the covenants under our revolving credit facility, the indentures governing our outstanding senior unsecured notes, or any future debt instruments to which we may become subject and do not obtain appropriate waivers, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness thereunder could be declared immediately due and payable and/or we may be restricted from further borrowing under our revolving credit facility.We may not meet expectations or targets in connection with our “green” financing arrangements, which could harm our reputation and business. From time to time, we may enter into “green” financing arrangements that require us to use proceeds for environmental sustainability purposes or have targets related to environmental sustainability.  For example, we entered into a revolving credit agreement on June 23, 2021 (the “Revolving Credit Agreement”) that contains a sustainability-linked pricing component, which provides for interest rate and facility fee reductions or increases based on meeting or missing targets related to environmental sustainability, specifically greenhouse gas emissions and renewable energy usage. For calendar year 2021, we did not achieve the greenhouse gas emissions reduction threshold goal related to this sustainability-linked pricing component due in part to increased demand for product, which did not have a material impact on our business, net income, or financing costs. On October 5, 2021, we issued $750 million sustainability-linked senior notes (the “Sustainability-Linked Senior Notes”). Our Sustainability-Linked Senior Notes initially bear interest at a rate of 1.7% per annum and are subject to an increase of an additional 30 basis points per annum from April 1, 2026 to the maturity date unless the Sustainability Performance Target (as defined in the Sustainability-Linked Senior Notes) has been satisfied.  Failing to use the net proceeds under green financing arrangements that satisfies investor criteria and expectations regarding environmental impact or achieve targets related to environmental sustainability under such financing arrangements could result in reputational harm and our business and operating results could be negatively impacted.If we are not able to meet our U.S. cash requirements, it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of foreign earnings, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.22We carry outside basis differences in certain of our subsidiaries, primarily arising from acquisition accounting adjustments and certain undistributed earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested. We intend to reinvest these funds in our international operations, and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings to fund our U.S. cash requirements. We require a substantial amount of cash in the United States for operating requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends and acquisitions. If we are not able to meet our U.S. cash requirements through operations, borrowings under our current revolving credit facility, future debt or equity offerings or other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost, it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of earnings that are indefinitely reinvested, and we may be required to pay additional taxes under current tax laws, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.General Risk Factors
Our results of operations could be affected by natural disasters in the locations in which we operate. We, like many companies in the semiconductor industry, rely on supplies, services, internal manufacturing capacity, wafer fabrication foundries and other subcontractors in locations around the world that are susceptible to natural disasters and other significant disruptions. Earthquakes, fires, tsunamis, flooding or other natural disasters may disrupt local semiconductor-related businesses and adversely affect manufacturing capacity, availability and cost of key raw materials, utilities and equipment, and availability of key services, including transport of our products worldwide.  Our insurance may not adequately cover losses resulting from such disruptions. Any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities, or those of our subcontractors or third-party wafer fabrication foundries, as a result of fire, flood, natural disaster, unavailability of utilities or otherwise, could result in a temporary or permanent loss of customers for affected products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, global climate change may result in certain natural disasters occurring more frequently or with greater intensity, such as drought, wildfires, storms, sea-level rise, and flooding, and could disrupt the availability of water necessary for the operation of our fabrication facilities located in semi-arid regions. The long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the semiconductor industry in particular are unclear, but could be severe. Our stock price may be volatile. The market price of our common stock may be volatile, as it may be significantly affected by factors including:•global economic conditions generally;•crises in global credit, debt and financial markets;•actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and operating results;•changes in financial estimates or other statements made by securities analysts or others in analyst reports or other publications, or our failure to perform in line with those estimates or statements or our published guidance;•financial results and prospects of our customers;•U.S. and foreign government actions, including with respect to trade, travel, export and taxation; •the extent of the impact and the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic;•changes in market valuations of other semiconductor companies;•rumors and speculation in the press, investment community or on social media about us, our customers or other companies in our industry;•announcements by us, our customers or our competitors of significant new products, technical innovations, material transactions, acquisitions or dispositions, litigation, capital commitments, including share repurchases and dividend policies, or revised earnings estimates;•departures of key personnel;•alleged noncompliance with laws, regulations or ethics standards by us or any of our employees, officers or directors; and•negative media publicity targeting us or our suppliers, customers or competitors.The stock market has historically experienced volatility, especially within the semiconductor industry, that often has been unrelated to the performance of particular companies, such as the response to rising inflation and increasing interest rates. These market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless of our operating results.Our directors and executive officers periodically buy or sell shares of our common stock in the market, including pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans. Regardless of the individual's reasons for such purchases or sales, securities analysts and investors could view such transactions as positive or negative indicators and our stock price could be adversely affected as a result.23"
13,ADI,ANALOG DEVICES,2021-12-03,"ITEM 1A.         RISK FACTORSSet forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are descriptions of certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements in this report.  Risks Related to our Acquisition of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. (Maxim)We will incur substantial expenses related to the integration of Maxim.We completed our acquisition of Maxim, which we refer to as the acquisition or the merger, on August 26, 2021. We have incurred and expect to incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with combining the operations of the two companies.  These costs and expenses include fees paid to financial, legal and accounting advisors, facilities and systems consolidation costs, severance and other potential employment-related costs, including severance payments that may be made to certain Maxim employees, filing fees, printing expenses and other related charges.The combined company has and will continue to incur restructuring and integration costs in connection with the merger.  The costs related to restructuring are being expensed as a cost of the ongoing results of operations.  There are a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that must be integrated in connection with the merger and the integration of Maxim’s business.  Although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs, strategic benefits, and additional income, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, may offset incremental transaction, merger-related and restructuring costs over time, any net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all.  Combining our business with Maxim’s may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected and the combined company may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger, which may adversely affect the combined company’s business results and negatively affect the value of the combined company’s common stock.  The success of the merger will depend on, among other things, the ability of the two companies to combine their businesses in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities and realizes expected cost savings.  The combined company may encounter difficulties in integrating our and Maxim’s businesses and realizing the anticipated benefits of the merger. The combined company must achieve the anticipated growth and cost savings without adversely affecting current revenues and investments in future growth.  If the combined company is not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.The merger involves the combination of two companies which operated, until the completion of the merger, as independent public companies. There can be no assurances that the two businesses can be integrated successfully.  It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees from both companies, the loss of customers, the disruption of  ongoing businesses, inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies, unexpected integration issues, higher than expected integration costs and an overall integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated. Management must devote attention and resources to integrating the combined company's business practices and operations.  Potential difficulties the combined company may encounter as the integration process continues include the following:  •lost sales and customers as a result of certain of our and/or Maxim's customers deciding not to do business with the combined company, or deciding to decrease their amount of business in order to reduce their reliance on a single company;•integrating personnel and operations from the two companies while maintaining focus on providing consistent, high-quality products and services, especially in the COVID-19 environment which has required employees to work remotely in some locations;•potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen or increased costs and expenses; and•performance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management’s attention caused by integrating the companies’ operations.Any of these factors could result in the combined company failing to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, on the expected timeline or at all. An inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the merger, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have an adverse effect upon the revenues, level of expenses and operating results of the combined company, which may adversely affect the value of the common stock of the combined company. In addition, the actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, and the anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized.  Actual growth and cost savings, if achieved, may be lower than what we  expect and may take longer to achieve than anticipated.  If we are not able to adequately address integration challenges, we may be unable to successfully integrate their operations or realize the anticipated benefits of the integration of the two companies. 11Risks Related to our Global OperationsThe extent to which the novel strain of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic will adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations is uncertain.The COVID-19 pandemic, and the numerous measures implemented by government authorities in response, have adversely impacted and are expected to continue to adversely impact our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers, and those of our respective vendors and suppliers. We have significant operations worldwide, including in the United States, the Philippines, Ireland, Thailand, Malaysia, China, and India. Each of these countries has been affected by the pandemic and taken measures to try to contain it, resulting in disruptions at some of our manufacturing operations and facilities, including restrictions on our access to facilities.  It is uncertain what the full extent of the impact, and duration, of such measures and potential future measures may be and how such measures will affect our vendors and suppliers. Increased restrictions on or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability of air transport, port closures, and increased border controls or closures, could limit our capacity to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices by, among other things, restricting employee travel, modifying employee work locations, and canceling physical participation in meetings, events and conferences.  As a result of our changed workplace practices, many of our employees are temporarily working remotely.  Any of these changes may adversely impact our business operations or customer relationships and result in further disruptions to our supply chain, manufacturing operations and facilities, and workplace.  We may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, and suppliers, which may cause even further disruption.  Although these alterations to our business practices are intended to minimize the spread of COVID-19, we cannot provide assurance that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by COVID-19, and if a significant number of our employees or members of our board of directors become ill, our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed.The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty and could result in a global recession. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which may adversely affect our and our customers’ and suppliers’ liquidity, cost of capital and ability to access the capital markets. As a result, the continued spread of COVID-19 could cause further disruption in our supply chain and customer demand, and could adversely affect the ability of our customers to perform, including in making timely payments to us, which could further adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.We cannot at this time fully quantify or forecast the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. The full extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, including the continued duration and severity of the pandemic, the spread of more contagious variants of the virus, the adoption rate of vaccines, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, or how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume.Political and economic uncertainty as well as disruptions in global credit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.Continuing political and global macroeconomic uncertainty, including related to the COVID-19 pandemic, trade and political disputes between the United States and China, China-Taiwan relations, and the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, and uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets may lead consumers and businesses to postpone or reduce spending, which may cause our customers to cancel, decrease or delay their existing and future orders for our products and make it difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities.  Financial difficulties experienced by our customers could result in nonpayment or payment delays for previously purchased products, thereby increasing our credit risk exposure.  Uncertainty regarding the macroeconomic conditions as well as the future stability of the global credit and financial markets could cause the value of the currency in the affected markets to deteriorate, thus reducing the purchasing power of those customers. Significant disruption to global credit and financial markets may also adversely affect our ability to access external financing sources on acceptable terms.  In addition, financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers, distributors or customers could result in product delays, increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges. If economic conditions deteriorate, we may record additional charges relating to restructuring costs or the impairment of assets and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.12We are exposed to business, economic, political, legal, regulatory and other risks through our significant worldwide operations, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We have significant operations and manufacturing facilities outside the United States, including in Ireland, the Philippines, Thailand, and Malaysia. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from customers in international markets, and we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the future.  Risks associated with our international business operations include the following:•political, legal and economic changes, crises or instability and civil unrest in markets in which we do business, such as potential macroeconomic weakness related to trade and political disputes between the United States and China,  changes in China-Taiwan relations that may adversely affect our operations in Taiwan, our customers, and the technology industry supply chain, the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union and the implementation of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement;•compliance requirements of U.S. customs and export regulations, including the Export Administration Regulations and the International Traffic and Arms Regulations;•currency conversion risks and exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations, including the potential impact of the transition from LIBOR;•trade policy, commercial, travel, export or taxation disputes or restrictions, government sanctions, import or export tariffs, changes to export classifications or other restrictions imposed by the U.S. government or by the governments of the countries in which we do business, particularly in China; •complex, varying and changing government regulations and legal standards and requirements, particularly with respect to tax regulations, price protection, competition practices, export control regulations and restrictions, customs and tax requirements, immigration, anti-boycott regulations, data privacy, intellectual property, anti-corruption and environmental compliance, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;•economic disruption from terrorism and threats of terrorism and the response to them by the U.S. and its allies;•increased managerial complexities, including different employment practices and labor issues;•changes in immigration laws, regulations and procedures and enforcement practices of various government agencies;•greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting such rights;•natural disasters or public health emergencies, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic;•transportation disruptions and delays and increases in labor and transportation costs;•changes to foreign taxes, tariffs and freight rates;•fluctuations in raw material costs and energy costs;•greater difficulty in accounts receivable collections and longer collection periods; and•costs associated with our foreign defined benefit pension plans.Any of these risks, or any other risks related to international business operations, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Many of these risks are present within our business operations in China.  For example, changes in U.S.-China relations, the political environment or international trade policies and relations could result in further revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of import or export duties and tariffs, restrictions on imports or exports, currency revaluations, or retaliatory actions, which have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results. In addition, expanded export restrictions may limit our ability to sell to certain Chinese companies and to third parties that do business with those companies. These restrictions have created and may continue to create uncertainty and caution with our current or prospective customers and may cause them to amass large inventories of our products, replace our products with products from another supplier that is not subject to the export restrictions, or focus on building indigenous semiconductor capacity to reduce reliance on U.S. suppliers. Furthermore, if these export restrictions cause our current or potential customers to view U.S. companies as unreliable, we could suffer reputational damage or lose business to foreign competitors who are not subject to such export restrictions, and our business could be materially harmed. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of these restrictions on our business, but these actions may have direct and indirect adverse impacts on our revenues and results of operations in China and elsewhere. In addition, our success in the Chinese markets may be adversely affected by China's continuously evolving policies, laws and regulations, including those relating to antitrust, cybersecurity, data protection and data privacy, the environment, indigenous innovation and the promotion of a domestic semiconductor industry, and intellectual property rights and enforcement and protection of those rights. 13If we are unable to address our U.S. cash requirements, it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of foreign earnings, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.We carry outside basis differences in certain of our subsidiaries, primarily arising from acquisition accounting adjustments and certain undistributed earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested. We intend to reinvest these funds in our international operations, and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings to fund our U.S. cash requirements.  We require a substantial amount of cash in the United States for operating requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends and acquisitions. If we are unable to address our U.S. cash requirements through operations, borrowings under our current revolving credit facility, future debt or equity offerings or other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost, it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of earnings that are indefinitely reinvested, and we may be required to pay additional taxes under current tax laws, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Risks Related to our Business, Industry and PartnersOur future revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate.Our future revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors, including:•the extent of the impact and the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic;•the effects of adverse economic conditions in the markets in which we sell our products, including inflationary pressures;•changes in customer demand or order patterns for our products and/or for end products that incorporate our products;•the timing, delay, reduction or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability to manage inventory;•our ability to accurately forecast distributor demand for our products;•our ability to accurately estimate future distributor pricing credits and/or stock rotation rights;•our ability to effectively manage our cost structure in both the short term and over a longer duration;•changes in geographic, product or customer mix;•changes in our effective tax rates or new or revised tax legislation in the United States, Ireland or worldwide; •the effects of issued, threatened or retaliatory government sanctions, trade barriers or economic restrictions; changes in law, regulations or other restrictions, including executive orders; and changes in import and export regulations, including restrictions on exports to certain companies or to third parties that do business with such companies, export classifications, or duties and tariffs, particularly with respect to China; •the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us, our customers or our competitors and the market acceptance of such products;•pricing decisions and competitive pricing pressures;•fluctuations in manufacturing yields, adequate availability of wafers and other raw materials, and manufacturing, assembly and test capacity;•the ability of our third-party suppliers, subcontractors and manufacturers to supply us with sufficient quantities of raw materials, products and/or components;•a decline in infrastructure spending by foreign governments, including China;•a decline in the U.S. government defense budget, changes in spending or budgetary priorities, a prolonged U.S. government shutdown or delays in contract awards;•any significant decline in our backlog;•our ability to recruit, hire, retain and motivate adequate numbers of engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of our customers;•our ability to generate new design opportunities and win competitive bid selection processes;•the increasing costs of providing employee benefits worldwide, including health insurance, retirement plan and pension plan contributions and retirement benefits; •our ability to utilize our manufacturing facilities at efficient levels;•potential significant litigation-related costs or product liability, warranty and/or indemnity claims, including those not covered by our suppliers or insurers;14•the difficulties inherent in forecasting future operating expense levels, including with respect to costs associated with labor, utilities, transportation and raw materials;•the costs related to compliance with increasing worldwide government, environmental and social responsibility standards; •new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting standards and practices; and•the effects of public health emergencies, civil unrest, natural disasters, widespread travel disruptions, security risks, terrorist activities, international conflicts and other events beyond our control.In addition, the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic upturns and downturns. Our business and certain of the end markets we serve are also subject to rapid technological changes and material fluctuations in demand based on end-user preferences.  There can be no assurance (i) that products stocked in our inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them, or (ii) that we will be able to design, develop and produce products in a timely fashion to accommodate changing customer demand. As a result of these and other factors, we may experience material fluctuations in future revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share on a quarterly or annual basis.  Our historical financial performance and results of operations should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance or results.  In addition, if our revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share results or expectations do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the market price of our common stock may decline.    Increases in our effective tax rate and exposure to additional tax liabilities may adversely impact our results of operations.Our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned.  Our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended October 30, 2021 was below our U.S. federal statutory rate of 21%.  This is primarily due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income. A number of factors may increase our future effective tax rate, including: new or revised tax laws or legislation or the interpretation of such laws or legislation by governmental authorities; increases in tax rates in various jurisdictions; variation in the mix of jurisdictions in which our profits are earned and taxed; deferred taxes arising from basis differences in investments in foreign subsidiaries; any adverse resolution of ongoing tax audits or adverse rulings from taxing authorities worldwide; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including executive compensation subject to the limitations of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code and amortization of assets acquired in connection with strategic transactions; decreased availability of tax deductions for stock-based compensation awards worldwide; and changes in available tax credits. In addition, we have a partial tax holiday through July 2025 in Malaysia. The ability to extend such tax holiday beyond its expiration date cannot be assured. In addition, if we fail to meet certain conditions of the tax holiday, we may lose the benefit of the tax holiday and/or be subject to additional taxes and/or penalties. Any significant increase in our future effective tax rate could adversely impact our net income during future periods.Compliance with tax legislation may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the Company, and therefore necessitate the use of estimates in our Consolidated Financial Statements and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions. As regulations and guidance evolve with respect to tax legislation, and as more information is gathered and analyzed, our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our Consolidated Financial Statements.We are also subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that determine how much profit has been earned and when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction.  Changes in these laws and regulations, including those that align to or are associated with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Actions Plans, could impact the jurisdictions where we are deemed to earn income, which could in turn adversely affect our tax liability and results of operations.Our customers typically do not make long-term product purchase commitments and incorrect forecasts or reductions, cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results.We typically do not have sales contracts with our customers that include long-term product purchase commitments. In certain markets where end-user demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict, some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment, even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all, or even any, of the product. In other instances, we manufacture product based on non-binding forecasts of customer demands, which may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis and at times may prove to be inaccurate. Additionally, our U.S. government contracts and subcontracts may be funded in increments over a number of government budget periods and typically can be terminated by the government for its convenience.  As a result, we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales, and we are subject to the risk of lower than expected orders or cancellations of orders, leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog. Further, if orders or forecasts for products that 15meet a customer’s unique requirements are canceled or unrealized we may be left with an inventory of unsaleable products, causing potential inventory write-offs, and hindering our ability to recover our costs. As a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the products that are subject to these uncertainties, the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial. Incorrect forecasts, or reductions, cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results.Our future success depends upon our ability to execute our business strategy, continue to innovate, improve our existing products, design, develop, produce and market new products, and identify and enter new markets.Our future success significantly depends on our ability to execute our business strategy, continue to innovate, improve our existing products, and design, develop, produce and market innovative new products and system-level solutions. Product design, development, innovation and enhancement is often a complex, time-consuming and costly process involving significant investment in research and development, with no assurance of return on investment. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new and improved products in a timely or efficient manner or that new and improved products, if developed, will achieve market acceptance. Our products generally must conform to various evolving and sometimes competing industry standards, which may adversely affect our ability to compete in certain markets or require us to incur significant costs. In addition, our customers generally impose very high quality and reliability standards on our products, which often change and may be difficult or costly to satisfy. Any inability to satisfy customer quality and reliability standards or comply with industry standards and technical requirements may adversely affect demand for our products and our results of operations. Our growth is also dependent on our ability to identify and penetrate new markets where we have limited experience yet require significant investments, resources and technological advancements in order to compete effectively, and there can be no assurance that we will achieve success in these markets.  There can be no assurance that the markets we serve and/or target based on our business strategy will grow in the future, that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets, that our products, or the end-products in which our products are used, will achieve customer acceptance in these markets, that competitors will not force price reductions or take market share from us, or that we can achieve or maintain adequate gross margins or profits in these markets.  We may not be able to compete successfully in markets within the semiconductor industry in the future.We face intense competition in the semiconductor industry, and we expect this competition to increase in the future, including from companies located outside of the United States.  Competition is generally based on innovation, design, quality and reliability of products, product performance, features and functionality, product pricing, availability and capacity, technological service and support, and the availability of integrated system solutions, with the relative importance of these factors varying among products, markets and customers. Many companies have sufficient financial, manufacturing, technical, sales and marketing resources to develop and market products that compete with our products. Some of our competitors may have more advantageous supply or development relationships with our current and potential customers or suppliers. Our competitors also include both emerging companies selling specialized products in markets we serve and companies outside of the U.S., including entities associated with well-funded efforts by foreign governments to create indigenous semiconductor industries.  Existing or new competitors may develop products or technologies that more effectively address the demands of our customers and markets with enhanced performance, features and functionality, lower power requirements, greater levels of integration or lower cost. In addition, as we seek to expand our business, including the design and production of products and services for developing and emerging markets, we may encounter increased competition from our current competitors and/or new competitors.  Increased competition in certain markets has resulted in and may continue to result in declining average selling prices, reduced gross margins and loss of market share in those markets. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors, or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased competition.  In addition, the semiconductor industry has experienced significant consolidation over the past several years.  Consolidation among our competitors could lead to a changing competitive landscape, which could negatively impact our competitive position and market share and harm our results of operations.We rely on third parties for supply of raw materials and parts, semiconductor wafer foundry services, assembly and test services, and transportation, among other things, and we generally cannot control their availability or conditions of supply or services.We rely, and plan to continue to rely, on third-party suppliers and service providers, including raw material and components suppliers, semiconductor wafer foundries, assembly and test contractors, and freight carriers (collectively, vendors) in manufacturing our products. This reliance involves several risks, including reduced control over availability, capacity utilization, delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, and costs. We currently source approximately half of our wafer requirements annually from third-party wafer foundries, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and others.  These foundries often provide wafer foundry services to our competitors and therefore periods of increased industry demand may result in capacity constraints. With respect to TSMC in particular, geopolitical changes in China-Taiwan relations could disrupt TSMC’s operations, which would adversely affect our ability to manufacture certain products. Recently, we have experienced increased demand leading to a constrained supply environment which we believe will continue in the near term.  In 16addition, our manufacturing processes require availability of certain raw materials and supplies. Limited or delayed access to these items could adversely affect our results of operations.  In certain instances, one of our vendors may be the sole source of highly specialized processing services or materials. If such vendor is unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver components to us on the time schedule and of the quality or quantity that we require, we may be forced to seek to engage an additional or replacement vendor, which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers. If additional or replacement vendors are not available, we may also experience delays in product development or shipment which could, in turn, result in the temporary or permanent loss of customers.A prolonged disruption of our internal manufacturing operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.In addition to leveraging an outsourcing model for manufacturing operations, we also rely on our internal manufacturing operations located in the United States, Ireland, the Philippines, Thailand and Malaysia. A prolonged disruption at, or inability to utilize, one or more of our manufacturing facilities, loss of raw materials or damage to our manufacturing equipment for any reason, including due to the COVID-19 pandemic, natural or man-made disasters, civil unrest or other events outside of our control, such as widespread outbreaks of illness, or the failure to maintain our labor force at one or more of these facilities, may disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in us being unable to timely satisfy customer demand. As a result, we could forgo revenue opportunities, potentially lose market share and damage our customer relationships, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.The markets for semiconductor products are cyclical, and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices, and conversely, we may not be able to satisfy unexpected demand for our products.The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly.  The demand for our products is subject to the strength of our four major end markets of Industrial, Automotive, Communications,  and Consumer.  If we expand our operations and workforce too rapidly or procure excessive resources in anticipation of increased demand for our products, and that demand does not materialize at the pace at which we expect, or declines, or if we overbuild inventory in a period of decreased demand, our operating results may be adversely affected as a result of increased operating expenses, reduced margins, underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges. These capacity expansions by us and other semiconductor manufacturers could also lead to overcapacity in our target markets which could lead to price erosion that would adversely impact our operating results. Conversely, during periods of rapid increases in demand, our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy the demand. In addition, we may not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner, procure adequate resources and raw materials, locate suitable third-party suppliers, or respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to demand for new products requested by our customers, and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected.Our semiconductor products are complex and we may be subject to warranty, indemnity and/or product liability claims, which could result in significant costs and damage to our reputation and adversely affect customer relationships, the market acceptance of our products and our operating results.Semiconductor products are highly complex and may contain defects that affect their quality or performance. Failures in our products and services or in the products of our customers could result in damage to our reputation for reliability and increase our legal or financial exposure to third parties. Certain of our products and services could also contain security vulnerabilities, defects, bugs and errors, which could also result in significant data losses, security breaches and theft of intellectual property. We generally warrant that our products will meet their published specifications, and that we will repair or replace defective products, for one year from the date title passes from us to the customer. We invest significant resources in the testing of our products; however, if any of our products contain defects, we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders. These problems may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or others, including liability for costs and expenses associated with product defects, including recalls, which may adversely impact our operating results. We may also be subject to customer intellectual property indemnity claims. Our customers have on occasion been sued, and may be sued in the future, by third parties alleging infringement of intellectual property rights, or damages resulting from use of our products. Those customers may seek indemnification from us under the terms and conditions of our sales contracts with them. In certain cases, our potential indemnification liability may be significant. Further, we sell to customers in industries such as automotive (including autonomous vehicles), aerospace, defense, and healthcare, where failure of the systems in which our products are integrated could cause damage to property or persons. We may be subject to product liability claims if our products, or the integration of our products, cause system failures. Any product liability claim, whether or not determined in our favor, could result in significant expense, divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, and harm our business.  In addition, if any of our products contain defects, or have reliability, quality or 17compatibility problems not capable of being resolved, our reputation may be damaged, which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to customers and which could also adversely affect our operating results. Furthermore, we market and sell our products through authorized third-party distributors, and from time to time our products may be diverted from our authorized distribution channels and sold on the “gray market.” There is a risk that customers purchasing our products on the gray market may use our products for purposes for which they were not intended, or may purchase counterfeit or substandard products, including products that have been altered, mishandled or damaged, or used products presented as new, which could result in damage to property or persons and cause serious reputational harm.The fabrication of integrated circuits is highly complex and precise, and our manufacturing processes utilize a substantial amount of technology. Minute impurities, contaminants in the manufacturing environment, difficulties in the fabrication process, defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process, manufacturing equipment failures, wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional. While we have significant expertise in semiconductor manufacturing, it is possible that some processes could become unstable. This instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.If we are unable to recruit or retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our business strategy will be adversely affected.Our continued success depends to a significant extent upon the recruitment, retention and effective succession of our key personnel, including our leadership team, management and technical personnel, particularly our experienced engineers. The competition for these employees is intense. The loss of key personnel or the inability to attract, hire and retain key employees with critical technical skills to achieve our strategy, including as a result of changes to immigration policies, could also have a material adverse effect on our business. We do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or other employees.To remain competitive, we may need to invest in or acquire other companies, purchase or license technology from third parties, or enter into other strategic transactions in order to introduce new products or enhance our existing products.An element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisitions of businesses, assets, products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings, diversify our product portfolio, expand our market coverage, increase our engineering workforce, expand our technical skill sets or enhance our technological capabilities. We may not be able to find businesses that have the technology or resources we need and, if we find such businesses, we may not be able to invest in, purchase or license the technology or resources on commercially favorable terms or at all. Acquisitions, investments and technology licenses are challenging to complete for a number of reasons, including difficulties in identifying potential targets, the cost of potential transactions, competition among prospective buyers and licensees, the need for regulatory approvals, and difficulties related to integration efforts.  In addition, investments in companies are subject to a risk of a partial or total loss of our investment.  Both in the U.S. and abroad, governmental regulation of acquisitions, including antitrust and other regulatory reviews and approvals, has become more complex, increasing the costs and risks of undertaking and consummating significant acquisitions. In order to finance a potential transaction, we may need to raise additional funds by issuing securities or borrowing money. We may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms, and the sale of our stock may result in the dilution of our existing shareholders or the issuance of securities with rights that are superior to the rights of our common shareholders.Acquisitions also involve a number of challenges and risks, including:•diversion of management’s attention in connection with both negotiating the transaction and integrating the acquired assets and businesses;•difficulty or delay integrating acquired technologies, operations, systems and infrastructure, and personnel with our existing businesses;•strain on managerial and operational resources as management tries to oversee larger or more complex operations;•the future funding requirements for acquired companies, including research and development costs, employee compensation and benefits, and operating expenses, which may be significant;•servicing significant debt that may be incurred in connection with acquisitions; •potential loss of key employees;•exposure to unforeseen liabilities or regulatory compliance issues of acquired companies; •higher than expected or unexpected costs relating to or associated with an acquisition and integration of assets and businesses;•difficulty realizing expected cost savings, operating synergies and growth prospects of an acquisition in a timely manner or at all; and18•increased risk of costly and time-consuming legal proceedings.If we are unable to successfully address these risks, we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of our acquisitions, which may have an adverse effect on our business strategy, plans and operating results.Our results of operations could be affected by natural disasters in the locations in which we operate.We, like many companies in the semiconductor industry, rely on supplies, services, internal manufacturing capacity, wafer fabrication foundries and other subcontractors in locations around the world that are susceptible to natural disasters and other significant disruptions. Earthquakes, fires, tsunamis, flooding or other natural disasters may disrupt local semiconductor-related businesses and adversely affect manufacturing capacity, availability and cost of key raw materials, utilities and equipment, and availability of key services, including transport of our products worldwide.  Our insurance may not adequately cover losses resulting from such disruptions.  Any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities, or those of our subcontractors or third-party wafer fabrication foundries, as a result of fire, flood, natural disaster, unavailability of utilities or otherwise, could result in a temporary or permanent loss of customers for affected products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, global climate change can result in certain natural disasters occurring more frequently or with greater intensity, such as drought, wildfires, storms, sea-level rise, and flooding, and could disrupt the availability of water necessary for the operation of our fabrication facilities located in semi-arid regions. During 2021, the west coast of the U.S. experienced historic wildfires where we have operations and manufacturing facilities. The long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the semiconductor industry in particular are unclear, but could be severe.Our operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors.A significant portion of our sales are through independent global and regional distributors that are not under our control.  These independent distributors generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts for our products or they could terminate their representation of us. We generally do not require letters of credit from our distributors, including our largest distributor, and are not protected against accounts receivable default or declarations of bankruptcy by these distributors. Our inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our operating results. Termination of a significant distributor or a group of distributors, whether at our initiative or the distributor’s initiative or through consolidation in the distribution industry, could disrupt our current business, and if we are unable to find suitable replacements with the appropriate scale and resources, our operating results could be adversely affected.We are  required to estimate the effects of returns and allowances provided to distributors and record revenue at the time of sale to the distributor.   If our estimates of such credits and rights are materially understated, it could cause subsequent adjustments that negatively impact our revenues and gross profits in a future period.Our stock price may be volatile.The market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future, as it may be significantly affected by factors including:•the extent of the impact and the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic;•global economic conditions generally;•crises in global credit, debt and financial markets;•actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and operating results;•changes in financial estimates or other statements made by securities analysts or others in analyst reports or other publications, or our failure to perform in line with those estimates or statements or our published guidance;•financial results and prospects of our customers;•U.S. and foreign government actions, including with respect to trade, travel, export and taxation;•changes in market valuations of other semiconductor companies;•rumors and speculation in the press, investment community or on social media about us, our customers or other companies in our industry;•announcements by us, our customers or our competitors of significant new products, technical innovations, material transactions, acquisitions or dispositions, litigation, capital commitments, including share repurchases and dividend policies, or revised earnings estimates;•departures of key personnel;19•alleged noncompliance with laws, regulations or ethics standards by us or any of our employees, officers or directors; and•negative media publicity targeting us or our suppliers, customers or competitors.The stock market has historically experienced volatility, especially within the semiconductor industry, that often has been unrelated to the performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless of our operating results.Our directors and executive officers periodically buy or sell shares of our common stock in the market, including pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans.  Regardless of the individual's reasons for such purchases or sales, securities analysts and investors could view such transactions as positive or negative indicators and our stock price could be adversely affected as a result.Risks Related to our IndebtednessIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow, we may not be able to service our debt obligations, including making payments on our outstanding indebtedness.Our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness when due depends upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations, many of which are beyond our control.  For example, the disruption to economic activity resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and is likely to continue to have, adverse effects on our supply chain, manufacturing operations and facilities, and workforce.  If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our outstanding debt, we may be required to, among other things:•seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets;•refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness;•borrow under our revolving credit facility;•divert funds that would otherwise be invested in growing our business operations;•repatriate earnings as dividends from foreign locations with potential for negative tax consequences; or•sell selected assets. Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt, which could negatively impact our financial results. In addition, we may not be able to obtain any such financing, refinancing or complete a sale of assets on economically favorable terms. In the case of financing or refinancing, favorable interest rates will depend on the health of the debt capital markets.Restrictions in our revolving credit facility and outstanding debt instruments may limit our activities.Our current revolving credit facility and outstanding debt instruments impose, and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may impose, restrictions that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our Company, including to undertake certain transactions, to create certain liens on our assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness. Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as changes in technology, government regulations and the level of competition in our markets. In addition, our revolving credit facility require us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. If we breach any of the covenants under our revolving credit facility, the indentures governing our outstanding senior unsecured notes, or any future debt instruments to which we may become subject and do not obtain appropriate waivers, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness thereunder could be declared immediately due and payable and/or we may be restricted from further borrowing under our revolving credit facility.Risks Related to Legal, Regulatory and Compliance MattersWe may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary intellectual property rights, which may limit our ability to compete effectively.Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We primarily rely on patent, mask work, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure agreements, information security practices, and other methods, to protect our proprietary information, technologies and processes. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain or disclose our confidential information, reverse engineer or copy our technologies, products or processes, or otherwise misappropriate our intellectual property. 20Moreover, the laws of foreign countries in which we design, manufacture, market and sell our products may afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property.There can be no assurance that the claims allowed in our issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. In addition, any of our existing or future patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. As such, any rights granted under these patents may not prevent others from exploiting our proprietary technology. We may not be able to obtain foreign patents or pending applications corresponding to our U.S. patents and applications. Even if patents are granted, we may not be able to effectively enforce our rights. If our patents and mask works do not adequately protect our technology, or if our registrations expire prior to end of life of our products, our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours. Our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents.We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and strategic partners. We also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies, documentation and other proprietary information. Despite these efforts, internal or external parties may attempt to copy, disclose, obtain or use our products or technology without our authorization. Also, former employees may seek employment with our business partners, customers or competitors, and there can be no assurance that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment. A significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems or certain of our products could materially and adversely affect our business or reputation.We rely on information technology systems throughout our company to keep financial records and customer data, process orders, manage inventory, coordinate shipments to customers, maintain confidential and proprietary information, assist in semiconductor engineering and other technical activities and operate other critical functions such as Internet connectivity, network communications and email. Our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, employee malfeasance, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events.  Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many of our employees and directors are temporarily working remotely, which may pose additional data security risks.  We also rely upon external cloud providers for certain infrastructure activities. If we were to experience a prolonged disruption in the information technology systems that involve our internal communications or our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business. We may also be subject to security breaches of our information technology systems and certain of our products caused by viruses, illegal break-ins or hacking, sabotage, or acts of vandalism by third parties or our employees or contractors.  Our security measures or those of our third-party service providers may not detect or prevent security breaches, defects, bugs or errors.  In addition, we provide our confidential and proprietary information to our strategic partners in certain cases where doing so is necessary to conduct our business.  Those third parties may be subject to security breaches or otherwise compromise the protection of such information.  Security breaches of our information technology systems or those of our partners could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential and proprietary information belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers, suppliers, or other third parties which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage.We are occasionally involved in litigation, including claims regarding intellectual property rights, which could be costly to litigate and could require us to redesign products or pay significant royalties.The semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights. Other companies or individuals have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes, and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling infringing products, if those patents are found to be valid and infringed by us. In the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property, and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement, and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel. We could also be subject to litigation or arbitration disputes arising under our contractual obligations, as well as customer indemnity, warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant costs and expenses as we defend those claims or pay damage awards. There can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities, and we may elect to self-insure with respect to certain matters. An adverse outcome in litigation or arbitration could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or on our operating results or cash flows in the period in which the dispute is resolved.21We are subject to environmental, health and safety (EHS) regulations, which could increase our expenses and affect our operating results.Our industry is subject to EHS requirements, particularly those that control and restrict the sourcing, use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage and disposal of certain substances, and materials used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process. Public attention to environmental sustainability and social responsibility concerns continues to increase, and our customers routinely include stringent environmental and other standards in their contracts with us. Changes in EHS laws or regulations may require us to invest in costly equipment or make manufacturing process changes and may adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products. In particular, climate change concerns and the potential resulting environmental impact may result in new environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations that may affect us, our suppliers, and our customers. Such laws or regulations could cause us to incur additional direct costs for compliance, as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers, suppliers, or both incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These costs may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.  In addition, we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability for damages caused by potential or actual releases of such materials. Any failure to control such materials adequately or to comply with existing or future EHS statutory or regulatory standards, requirements or contractual obligations could result in any of the following, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results:•liability for damages and remediation; •the imposition of regulatory penalties and civil and criminal fines; •the suspension or termination of the development, manufacture, sale or use of certain of our products; •changes to our manufacturing processes or a need to substitute materials that may cost more or be less available;•damage to our reputation; and/or •increased expenses associated with compliance.If we fail to comply with government contracting regulations, we could suffer a loss of revenue or incur price adjustments or other penalties.Some of our revenue is derived from contracts with agencies of the United States government and subcontracts with its prime contractors. As a United States government contractor or subcontractor, we are subject to federal contracting regulations, including the Federal Acquisition Regulations, which govern the allowability of costs incurred by us in the performance of United States government contracts. Certain contract pricing is based on estimated direct and indirect costs, which are subject to change. Additionally, the United States government is entitled after final payment on certain negotiated contracts to examine all of our cost records with respect to such contracts and to seek a downward adjustment to the price of the contract if it determines that we failed to furnish complete, accurate and current cost or pricing data in connection with the negotiation of the price of the contract.In connection with our United States government business, we are also subject to government audits and to review and approval of our policies, procedures, and internal controls for compliance with procurement regulations and applicable laws, such as the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification. In certain circumstances, if we do not comply with the terms of a government contract or with regulations or statutes, we could be subject to downward contract price adjustments or refund obligations or could in extreme circumstances be assessed civil and criminal penalties or be debarred or suspended from obtaining future contracts for a specified period of time. Any such suspension or debarment or other sanction could have an adverse effect on our business.Under some of our government subcontracts, we are required to maintain secure facilities and to obtain security clearances for personnel involved in performance of the contract, in compliance with applicable federal standards. If we were unable to comply with these requirements, or if personnel critical to our performance of these contracts were unable to obtain or maintain their security clearances, we might be unable to perform these contracts or compete for other projects of this nature, which could adversely affect our revenue"
11,ADI,ANALOG DEVICES,2020-11-24,"ITEM 1A.         RISK FACTORSSet forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are descriptions of certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements in this report.  Risks Related to the Proposed Acquisition of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.Our ability to complete the acquisition of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc. (Maxim) is subject to various closing conditions, including the receipt of consents and approvals from governmental authorities, which may impose conditions that could adversely affect us or cause the acquisition not to be completed. On July 12, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement (the Merger Agreement) to acquire Maxim, an independent manufacturer of innovative analog and mixed-signal products and technologies. The merger is subject to a number of conditions to closing as specified in the Merger Agreement.  These closing conditions include, among others, the receipt of required approvals under certain foreign competition laws, and the absence of governmental restraints or prohibitions preventing the consummation of the merger.  No assurance can be given that the required governmental and regulatory consents and approvals will be obtained or that the required conditions to closing will be satisfied, and, if all required consents and approvals are obtained and the required conditions are satisfied, no assurance can be given as to the terms, conditions and timing of such consents and approvals.  Any delay in completing the merger could cause the combined company not to realize, or to be delayed in realizing, some or all of the benefits that we and Maxim expect to achieve if the merger is successfully completed within its expected time frame.Additionally, either we or Maxim may terminate the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, including, among other reasons, if the merger is not completed by July 12, 2021 (which date may be extended under certain circumstances).  Under certain circumstances, including if the proposed merger is terminated due to a failure to obtain the required regulatory clearances, we may be required to pay Maxim a termination fee of $830.0 million. We can provide no assurance that the various closing conditions will be satisfied and that the necessary approvals will be obtained, or that any required conditions will not materially adversely affect the combined company following the acquisition. In addition, we can provide no assurance that these conditions will not result in the abandonment or delay of the acquisition. The occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the trading price of our common stock.The termination of the Merger Agreement could negatively impact our business. If the merger is not completed for any reason, our ongoing business may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the expected benefits of having completed the merger, we would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:  •we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including negative impacts on our stock price; •we may experience negative reactions from our customers, suppliers, distributors and employees; •we will be required to pay our costs relating to the merger, such as financial advisory, legal, financing and accounting costs and associated fees and expenses, whether or not the merger is completed; •the Merger Agreement places certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to completion of the merger and such restrictions, the waiver of which is subject to Maxim’s consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), may prevent us from taking certain actions during the pendency of the merger; and •matters relating to the merger (including integration planning) require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management, which could otherwise have been devoted to day-to-day operations or to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to our business.In addition, we could be subject to time-consuming and costly litigation related to the merger.  For example, as previously disclosed, in August and September 2020, three lawsuits were filed against the Company in connection with our proposed acquisition of Maxim.  Two of the lawsuits were brought by purported shareholders against the Company and the members of our board of directors and the third lawsuit was brought by a purported shareholder of Maxim against Maxim, the members of Maxim’s board of directors, the Company and a subsidiary of the Company.  In exchange for certain disclosures that we and Maxim voluntarily made in Current Reports on Form 8-K filed on September 30, 2020, plaintiffs in each of the lawsuits voluntarily dismissed their actions in their entirety, with prejudice as to the named plaintiffs only and without prejudice to any other members of any putative class.From and after the date of the Merger Agreement and prior to completion of the merger, the Merger Agreement restricts us from taking specified actions without Maxim’s consent and requires that our business be conducted in the ordinary course in 10all material respects.  These restrictions may prevent us from making appropriate changes to our business or organizational structure or from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the merger, and could have the effect of delaying or preventing other strategic transactions.  Adverse effects arising from these restrictions during the pendency of the merger could be exacerbated by any delays in consummation of the merger or termination of the Merger Agreement.     Whether or not the merger is completed, the announcement and pendency of the merger could cause disruptions in our business, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. Whether or not the merger is completed, the announcement and pendency of the merger could cause disruptions in our business.  Specifically:  •our and Maxim’s current and prospective employees will experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company, which might adversely affect the two companies’ abilities to retain key managers and other employees; •uncertainty regarding the completion of the merger may cause our and Maxim’s customers, suppliers, distributors, vendors, strategic partners or others that deal with us or Maxim to delay or defer entering into contracts with us or Maxim, make other decisions concerning us or Maxim, or seek to change or cancel existing business relationships with us or Maxim, which could negatively affect our respective businesses; •the Merger Agreement restricts us and our subsidiaries from taking specified actions during the pendency of the merger without Maxim’s consent, which may prevent us from pursuing attractive business opportunities or strategic transactions that may arise prior to the completion of the merger; and •the attention of our and Maxim’s management may be directed toward the completion of the merger. We have diverted significant management resources in an effort to complete the merger and are subject to restrictions contained in the Merger Agreement on the conduct of our business.  If the merger is not completed, we will have incurred significant costs, including the diversion of management resources, for which we will have received little or no benefit. We will incur significant acquisition-related costs in connection with the Maxim acquisition, and the combined company could incur substantial expenses related to the integration of Maxim.We have incurred and expect to incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with combining the operations of the two companies, as well as transaction fees and other costs related to the merger.  These costs and expenses include fees paid to financial, legal and accounting advisors, facilities and systems consolidation costs, severance and other potential employment-related costs, including severance payments that may be made to certain Maxim employees, filing fees, printing expenses and other related charges.  We will need to pay some of these costs regardless of whether the merger is completed. The combined company will also incur restructuring and integration costs in connection with the merger.  The costs related to restructuring will be expensed as a cost of the ongoing results of operations of either us or the combined company.  There are a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that must be integrated in connection with the merger and the integration of Maxim’s business.  Although we expect that the elimination of duplicative costs, strategic benefits, and additional income, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, may offset incremental transaction, merger-related and restructuring costs over time, any net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all.  We will bear many of these costs even if the merger is not completed.  While we have assumed that certain expenses would be incurred in connection with the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, there are many factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration and implementation expenses. Combining our business with Maxim’s may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected and the combined company may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger, which may adversely affect the combined company’s business results and negatively affect the value of the combined company’s common stock.  The success of the merger will depend on, among other things, the ability of the two companies to combine their businesses in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities and realizes expected cost savings.  The combined company may encounter difficulties in integrating our and Maxim’s businesses and realizing the anticipated benefits of the merger. The combined company must achieve the anticipated growth and cost savings without adversely affecting current revenues and investments in future growth.  If the combined company is not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected.The merger involves the combination of two companies which currently operate, and until the completion of the merger will continue to operate, as independent public companies. There can be no assurances that our respective businesses can be integrated successfully.  It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees from both 11companies, the loss of customers, the disruption of our, Maxim’s or both companies’ ongoing businesses, inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies, unexpected integration issues, higher than expected integration costs and an overall post-completion integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated. The combined company will be required to devote management attention and resources to integrating its business practices and operations, and prior to the merger, management attention and resources will be required to plan for such integration. Potential difficulties the combined company may encounter in the integration process include the following:  •lost sales and customers as a result of certain of our and/or Maxim's customers deciding not to do business with the combined company, or deciding to decrease their amount of business in order to reduce their reliance on a single company;•integrating personnel from the two companies while maintaining focus on providing consistent, high-quality products and services, especially in the COVID-19 environment which has required employees to work remotely in some locations;•potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with the merger; and•our and/or Maxim's performance shortfalls as a result of the diversion of management’s attention caused by completing the merger and integrating the companies’ operations.Any of these factors could result in the combined company failing to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, on the expected timeline or at all. An inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of the merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, as well as any delays encountered in the integration process, could have an adverse effect upon the revenues, level of expenses and operating results of the combined company, which may adversely affect the value of the common stock of the combined company. In addition, the actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, and the anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized.  Actual growth and cost savings, if achieved, may be lower than what we and Maxim expect and may take longer to achieve than anticipated.  If we and Maxim are not able to adequately address integration challenges, we may be unable to successfully integrate their operations or realize the anticipated benefits of the integration of the two companies. The market value of our common stock could decline if large amounts of our common stock are sold following the Maxim acquisition.If the merger is consummated, it is expected that we will issue a significant number of shares of our common stock to former Maxim stockholders.  Former Maxim stockholders may decide not to hold the shares of our common stock that they will receive in the merger, and our shareholders may decide to reduce their investment in us as a result of the changes to our investment profile as a result of the merger.  Other Maxim stockholders, such as funds with limitations on their permitted holdings of stock in individual issuers, may be required to sell the shares of our common stock that they receive in the merger.  Such sales of our common stock could have the effect of depressing the market price for our common stock.Risks Related to our Global OperationsThe extent to which the novel strain of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic will adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations is uncertain.The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in government authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and shutdowns. These measures have adversely impacted and are expected to further adversely impact our workforce and operations, the operations of our customers, and those of our respective vendors and suppliers. We have significant operations worldwide, including in the United States, the Philippines, Ireland, Singapore, Malaysia, China, and India, and each of these countries has been affected by the pandemic and taken measures to try to contain it, resulting in disruptions at some of our manufacturing operations and facilities. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the impact, and expected duration, of such measures and potential future measures, and restrictions on our access to our facilities or on our support operations or workforce, or similar limitations for our vendors and suppliers. Increased restrictions on or disruptions of transportation, such as reduced availability of air transport, port closures, and increased border controls or closures, would limit our capacity to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices, including restricting employee travel, modifying employee work locations, and canceling physical participation in meetings, events and conferences, and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, and suppliers. For example, many of our employees are temporarily working remotely, which may impact 12our business operations or customer relationships.  Such actions may result in further disruptions to our supply chain, manufacturing operations and facilities, and workforce. We cannot provide assurance that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by COVID-19, and our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed.The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty and has caused an economic slowdown that is likely to continue and result in a global recession. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which may adversely affect our and our customers’ and suppliers’ liquidity, cost of capital and ability to access the capital markets. As a result, the continued spread of COVID-19 could cause further disruption in our supply chain and customer demand, and could adversely affect the ability of our customers to perform, including in making timely payments to us, which could further adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.We cannot at this time fully quantify or forecast the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. The degree to which the pandemic impacts our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, or how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume.Political and economic uncertainty as well as disruptions in global credit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.Continuing political and global macroeconomic uncertainty, including related to the COVID-19 pandemic, trade and political disputes between the United States and China, and the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, and uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets may lead consumers and businesses to postpone or reduce spending, which may cause our customers to cancel, decrease or delay their existing and future orders for our products and make it difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities.  Financial difficulties experienced by our customers could result in nonpayment or payment delays for previously purchased products, thereby increasing our credit risk exposure.  Uncertainty regarding the macroeconomic conditions as well as the future stability of the global credit and financial markets could cause the value of the currency in the affected markets to deteriorate, thus reducing the purchasing power of those customers. Significant disruption to global credit and financial markets may also adversely affect our ability to access external financing sources on acceptable terms.  In addition, financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers, distributors or customers could result in product delays, increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges. If economic conditions deteriorate, we may record additional charges relating to restructuring costs or the impairment of assets and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.We are exposed to business, economic, political, legal, regulatory and other risks through our significant worldwide operations, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We have significant operations and manufacturing facilities outside the United States, including in Ireland, the Philippines, Singapore and Malaysia. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from customers in international markets, and we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the future.  Risks associated with our international business operations include the following:•political, legal and economic changes, crises or instability and civil unrest in markets in which we do business, including potential macroeconomic weakness related to trade and political disputes between the United States and China, the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union and the implementation of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement;•compliance requirements of U.S. customs and export regulations, including the Export Administration Regulations and the International Traffic and Arms Regulations;•currency conversion risks and exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations, including the potential impact of the transition from LIBOR;•trade policy, commercial, travel, export or taxation disputes or restrictions, government sanctions, import or export tariffs, changes to export classifications or other restrictions imposed by the U.S. government or by the governments of the countries in which we do business, particularly in China; •complex, varying and changing government regulations and legal standards and requirements, particularly with respect to tax regulations, price protection, competition practices, export control regulations and restrictions, customs and tax requirements, immigration, anti-boycott regulations, data privacy, intellectual property, anti-corruption and environmental compliance, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;•economic disruption from terrorism and threats of terrorism and the response to them by the U.S. and its allies;•increased managerial complexities, including different employment practices and labor issues;•changes in immigration laws, regulations and procedures and enforcement practices of various government agencies;13•greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting such rights;•natural disasters or public health emergencies, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic;•transportation disruptions and delays and increases in labor and transportation costs;•changes to foreign taxes, tariffs and freight rates;•fluctuations in raw material costs and energy costs;•greater difficulty in accounts receivable collections and longer collection periods; and•costs associated with our foreign defined benefit pension plans.Any of these risks, or any other risks related to international business operations, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Many of these risks are present within our business operations in China.  For example, changes in U.S.-China relations, the political environment or international trade policies and relations could result in further revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of import or export duties and tariffs, restrictions on imports or exports, currency revaluations, or retaliatory actions, which have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results. For example, the U.S. government has recently expanded export restrictions that limit our ability to sell to certain Chinese companies and to third parties that do business with those companies. These restrictions may negatively impact demand for our products, including by causing our current or potential customers to amass large inventories of our products, replace our products with products from another supplier that is not subject to the export restrictions, or focus on building indigenous semiconductor capacity to reduce reliance on U.S. suppliers. Furthermore, if these export restrictions cause our current or potential customers to view U.S. companies as unreliable, we could suffer reputational damage or lose business to foreign competitors who are not subject to such export restrictions, and our business could be materially harmed. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of these restrictions on our business, but these actions may have direct and indirect adverse impacts on our revenues and results of operations in China and elsewhere. In addition, our success in the Chinese markets may be adversely affected by China's continuously evolving policies, laws and regulations, including those relating to antitrust, cybersecurity and data protection, the environment, indigenous innovation and the promotion of a domestic semiconductor industry, and intellectual property rights and enforcement and protection of those rights. If we are unable to address our U.S. cash requirements, it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of foreign earnings, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.We carry outside basis differences in certain of our subsidiaries, primarily arising from acquisition accounting adjustments and undistributed earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested. We intend to reinvest these funds in our international operations, and our current plans do not demonstrate a need to repatriate these earnings to fund our U.S. cash requirements.  We require a substantial amount of cash in the United States for operating requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends and acquisitions. If we are unable to address our U.S. cash requirements through operations, borrowings under our current revolving credit facility, future debt or equity offerings or other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost, it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of earnings that are indefinitely reinvested, and we may be required to pay additional taxes under current tax laws, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Risks Related to our Business, Industry and PartnersOur future revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate.Our future revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors, including:•the extent of the impact and the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic;•the effects of adverse economic conditions in the markets in which we sell our products;•changes in customer demand or order patterns for our products and/or for end products that incorporate our products;•the timing, delay, reduction or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability to manage inventory;•our ability to accurately forecast distributor demand for our products;•our ability to accurately estimate future distributor pricing credits and/or stock rotation rights;•our ability to effectively manage our cost structure in both the short term and over a longer duration;•changes in geographic, product or customer mix;14•changes in our effective tax rates or new or revised tax legislation in the United States, Ireland or worldwide; •the effects of issued, threatened or retaliatory government sanctions, trade barriers or economic restrictions; changes in law, regulations or other restrictions, including executive orders; and changes in import and export regulations, including restrictions on exports to certain companies or to third parties that do business with such companies, export classifications, or duties and tariffs, particularly with respect to China; •the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us, our customers or our competitors and the market acceptance of such products;•pricing decisions and competitive pricing pressures;•fluctuations in manufacturing yields, adequate availability of wafers and other raw materials, and manufacturing, assembly and test capacity;•the ability of our third-party suppliers, subcontractors and manufacturers to supply us with sufficient quantities of raw materials, products and/or components;•a decline in infrastructure spending by foreign governments, including China;•a decline in the U.S. government defense budget, changes in spending or budgetary priorities, a prolonged U.S. government shutdown or delays in contract awards;•any significant decline in our backlog;•our ability to recruit, hire, retain and motivate adequate numbers of engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of our customers;•our ability to generate new design opportunities and win competitive bid selection processes;•the increasing costs of providing employee benefits worldwide, including health insurance, retirement plan and pension plan contributions and retirement benefits; •our ability to utilize our manufacturing facilities at efficient levels;•potential significant litigation-related costs or product liability, warranty and/or indemnity claims, including those not covered by our suppliers or insurers;•the difficulties inherent in forecasting future operating expense levels, including with respect to costs associated with labor, utilities, transportation and raw materials;•the costs related to compliance with increasing worldwide government, environmental and social responsibility standards; •new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting standards and practices; and•the effects of public health emergencies, civil unrest, natural disasters, widespread travel disruptions, security risks, terrorist activities, international conflicts and other events beyond our control.In addition, the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic upturns and downturns. Our business and certain of the end markets we serve are also subject to rapid technological changes and material fluctuations in demand based on end-user preferences.  There can be no assurance (i) that products stocked in our inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them, or (ii) that we will be able to design, develop and produce products in a timely fashion to accommodate changing customer demand. As a result of these and other factors, we may experience material fluctuations in future revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share on a quarterly or annual basis.  Our historical financial performance and results of operations should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance or results.  In addition, if our revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share results or expectations do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the market price of our common stock may decline.    Increases in our effective tax rate and exposure to additional tax liabilities may adversely impact our results of operations.Our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned.  Our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020 was below our U.S. federal statutory rate of 21%.  This is primarily due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income. A number of factors may increase our future effective tax rate, including: new or revised tax laws or legislation or the interpretation of such laws or legislation by governmental authorities; increases in tax rates in various jurisdictions; variation in the mix of jurisdictions in which our profits are earned and taxed; deferred taxes arising from basis differences in investments in foreign subsidiaries; any adverse resolution of ongoing tax audits or adverse rulings from taxing authorities worldwide, including our current transfer pricing appeal in Ireland; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including executive compensation subject to the limitations of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code and amortization 15of assets acquired in connection with strategic transactions; decreased availability of tax deductions for stock-based compensation awards worldwide; and changes in available tax credits. In addition, we have a partial tax holiday through July 2025 in Malaysia. The ability to extend such tax holiday beyond its expiration date cannot be assured. In addition, if we fail to meet certain conditions of the tax holiday, we may lose the benefit of the tax holiday and/or be subject to additional taxes and/or penalties. Any significant increase in our future effective tax rate could adversely impact our net income during future periods.Compliance with tax legislation may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the Company, and therefore necessitate the use of estimates in our Consolidated Financial Statements and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions. As regulations and guidance evolve with respect to tax legislation, and as more information is gathered and analyzed, our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our Consolidated Financial Statements.We are also subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that determine how much profit has been earned and when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction.  Changes in these laws and regulations, including those that align to or are associated with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Actions Plans, could impact the jurisdictions where we are deemed to earn income, which could in turn adversely affect our tax liability and results of operations.Our customers typically do not make long-term product purchase commitments and incorrect forecasts or reductions, cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results.We typically do not have sales contracts with our customers that include long-term product purchase commitments. In certain markets where end-user demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict, some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment, even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all, or even any, of the product. In other instances, we manufacture product based on non-binding forecasts of customer demands, which may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis and at times may prove to be inaccurate. Additionally, our U.S. government contracts and subcontracts may be funded in increments over a number of government budget periods and typically can be terminated by the government for its convenience.  As a result, we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales, and we are subject to the risk of lower than expected orders or cancellations of orders, leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog. Further, if orders or forecasts for products that meet a customer’s unique requirements are canceled or unrealized we may be left with an inventory of unsaleable products, causing potential inventory write-offs, and hindering our ability to recover our costs. As a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the products that are subject to these uncertainties, the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial. Incorrect forecasts, or reductions, cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results.Our future success depends upon our ability to execute our business strategy, continue to innovate, improve our existing products, design, develop, produce and market new products, and identify and enter new markets.Our future success significantly depends on our ability to execute our business strategy, continue to innovate, improve our existing products, and design, develop, produce and market innovative new products and system-level solutions. Product design, development, innovation and enhancement is often a complex, time-consuming and costly process involving significant investment in research and development, with no assurance of return on investment. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new and improved products in a timely or efficient manner or that new and improved products, if developed, will achieve market acceptance. Our products generally must conform to various evolving and sometimes competing industry standards, which may adversely affect our ability to compete in certain markets or require us to incur significant costs. In addition, our customers generally impose very high quality and reliability standards on our products, which often change and may be difficult or costly to satisfy. Any inability to satisfy customer quality and reliability standards or comply with industry standards and technical requirements may adversely affect demand for our products and our results of operations. Our growth is also dependent on our ability to identify and penetrate new markets where we have limited experience yet require significant investments, resources and technological advancements in order to compete effectively, and there can be no assurance that we will achieve success in these markets.  There can be no assurance that the markets we serve and/or target based on our business strategy will grow in the future, that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets, that our products, or the end-products in which our products are used, will achieve customer acceptance in these markets, that competitors will not force price reductions or take market share from us, or that we can achieve or maintain adequate gross margins or profits in these markets.  16We may not be able to compete successfully in markets within the semiconductor industry in the future.We face intense competition in the semiconductor industry, and we expect this competition to increase in the future, including from companies located outside of the United States.  For further discussion of our competitors, see Part I, Item 1 - Business—Competition of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Competition is generally based on innovation, design, quality and reliability of products, product performance, features and functionality, product pricing, availability and capacity, technological service and support, and the availability of integrated system solutions, with the relative importance of these factors varying among products, markets and customers. Many companies have sufficient financial, manufacturing, technical, sales and marketing resources to develop and market products that compete with our products. Some of our competitors may have more advantageous supply or development relationships with our current and potential customers or suppliers. Our competitors also include both emerging companies selling specialized products in markets we serve and companies outside of the U.S., including entities associated with well-funded efforts by foreign governments to create indigenous semiconductor industries.  Existing or new competitors may develop products or technologies that more effectively address the demands of our customers and markets with enhanced performance, features and functionality, lower power requirements, greater levels of integration or lower cost. In addition, as we seek to expand our business, including the design and production of products and services for developing and emerging markets, we may encounter increased competition from our current competitors and/or new competitors.  Increased competition in certain markets has resulted in and may continue to result in declining average selling prices, reduced gross margins and loss of market share in those markets. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors, or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased competition.  In addition, the semiconductor industry has experienced significant consolidation over the past several years.  Consolidation among our competitors could lead to a changing competitive landscape, which could negatively impact our competitive position and market share and harm our results of operations.We rely on third parties for supply of raw materials and parts, semiconductor wafer foundry services, assembly and test services, and transportation, among other things, and we generally cannot control their availability or conditions of supply or services.We rely, and plan to continue to rely, on third-party suppliers and service providers, including raw material and components suppliers, semiconductor wafer foundries, assembly and test contractors, and freight carriers (collectively, vendors) in manufacturing our products. This reliance involves several risks, including reduced control over availability, capacity utilization, delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, and costs. We currently source approximately half of our wafer requirements annually from third-party wafer foundries, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and others.  These foundries often provide wafer foundry services to our competitors and therefore periods of increased industry demand may result in capacity constraints. In addition, in certain instances, one of our vendors may be the sole source of highly specialized processing services or materials. If such vendor is unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver components to us on the time schedule and of the quality or quantity that we require, we may be forced to seek to engage an additional or replacement vendor, which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers. If additional or replacement vendors are not available, we may also experience delays in product development or shipment which could, in turn, result in the temporary or permanent loss of customers.A prolonged disruption of our internal manufacturing operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.In addition to leveraging an outsourcing model for manufacturing operations, we also rely on our internal manufacturing operations located in the United States, Ireland, the Philippines, Singapore and Malaysia. A prolonged disruption at, or inability to utilize, one or more of our manufacturing facilities, loss of raw materials or damage to our manufacturing equipment for any reason, including due to the COVID-19 pandemic, natural or man-made disasters, civil unrest or other events outside of our control, such as widespread outbreaks of illness, or the failure to maintain our labor force at one or more of these facilities, may disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in us being unable to timely satisfy customer demand. As a result, we could forgo revenue opportunities, potentially lose market share and damage our customer relationships, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.The markets for semiconductor products are cyclical, and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices, and conversely, we may not be able to satisfy unexpected demand for our products.The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly.  The demand for our products is subject to the strength of our four major end markets of Industrial, Communications, Automotive and Consumer.  If we expand our operations and workforce too rapidly or procure excessive resources in anticipation of increased demand for our products, and that demand does not materialize at the pace at which we expect, or declines, or if we overbuild inventory in a period of decreased demand, our operating results may be adversely affected as a result of increased operating expenses, reduced margins, underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges. These capacity expansions by us and other semiconductor manufacturers could also lead to overcapacity in our target markets 17which could lead to price erosion that would adversely impact our operating results. Conversely, during periods of rapid increases in demand, our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy the demand. In addition, we may not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner, procure adequate resources and raw materials, locate suitable third-party suppliers, or respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to demand for new products requested by our customers, and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected.Our semiconductor products are complex and we may be subject to warranty, indemnity and/or product liability claims, which could result in significant costs and damage to our reputation and adversely affect customer relationships, the market acceptance of our products and our operating results.Semiconductor products are highly complex and may contain defects that affect their quality or performance. Failures in our products and services or in the products of our customers could result in damage to our reputation for reliability and increase our legal or financial exposure to third parties. Certain of our products and services could also contain security vulnerabilities, defects, bugs and errors, which could also result in significant data losses, security breaches and theft of intellectual property. We generally warrant that our products will meet their published specifications, and that we will repair or replace defective products, for one year from the date title passes from us to the customer. We invest significant resources in the testing of our products; however, if any of our products contain defects, we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders. These problems may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or others, including liability for costs and expenses associated with product defects, including recalls, which may adversely impact our operating results. We may also be subject to customer intellectual property indemnity claims. Our customers have on occasion been sued, and may be sued in the future, by third parties alleging infringement of intellectual property rights, or damages resulting from use of our products. Those customers may seek indemnification from us under the terms and conditions of our sales contracts with them. In certain cases, our potential indemnification liability may be significant. Further, we sell to customers in industries such as automotive (including autonomous vehicles), aerospace, defense, and healthcare, where failure of the systems in which our products are integrated could cause damage to property or persons. We may be subject to product liability claims if our products, or the integration of our products, cause system failures. Any product liability claim, whether or not determined in our favor, could result in significant expense, divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, and harm our business.  In addition, if any of our products contain defects, or have reliability, quality or compatibility problems not capable of being resolved, our reputation may be damaged, which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to customers and which could also adversely affect our operating results. Furthermore, we market and sell our products through authorized third-party distributors, and from time to time our products may be diverted from our authorized distribution channels and sold on the “gray market.” There is a risk that customers purchasing our products on the gray market may use our products for purposes for which they were not intended, or may purchase counterfeit or substandard products, including products that have been altered, mishandled or damaged, or used products presented as new, which could result in damage to property or persons and cause serious reputational harm.The fabrication of integrated circuits is highly complex and precise, and our manufacturing processes utilize a substantial amount of technology. Minute impurities, contaminants in the manufacturing environment, difficulties in the fabrication process, defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process, manufacturing equipment failures, wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional. While we have significant expertise in semiconductor manufacturing, it is possible that some processes could become unstable. This instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.If we are unable to recruit or retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our business strategy will be adversely affected.Our continued success depends to a significant extent upon the recruitment, retention and effective succession of our key personnel, including our leadership team, management and technical personnel, particularly our experienced engineers. The competition for these employees is intense. The loss of key personnel or the inability to attract, hire and retain key employees with critical technical skills to achieve our strategy, including as a result of changes to immigration policies, could also have a material adverse effect on our business. We do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or other employees.To remain competitive, we may need to invest in or acquire other companies, purchase or license technology from third parties, or enter into other strategic transactions in order to introduce new products or enhance our existing products.An element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisitions of businesses, assets, products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings, diversify our product portfolio, expand our market 18coverage, increase our engineering workforce, expand our technical skill sets or enhance our technological capabilities. We may not be able to find businesses that have the technology or resources we need and, if we find such businesses, we may not be able to invest in, purchase or license the technology or resources on commercially favorable terms or at all. Acquisitions, investments and technology licenses are challenging to complete for a number of reasons, including difficulties in identifying potential targets, the cost of potential transactions, competition among prospective buyers and licensees, the need for regulatory approvals, and difficulties related to integration efforts.  In addition, investments in companies are subject to a risk of a partial or total loss of our investment.  Both in the U.S. and abroad, governmental regulation of acquisitions, including antitrust and other regulatory reviews and approvals, has become more complex, increasing the costs and risks of undertaking and consummating significant acquisitions. In order to finance a potential transaction, we may need to raise additional funds by issuing securities or borrowing money. We may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms, and the sale of our stock may result in the dilution of our existing shareholders or the issuance of securities with rights that are superior to the rights of our common shareholders.Acquisitions also involve a number of challenges and risks, including:•diversion of management’s attention in connection with both negotiating the transaction and integrating the acquired assets and businesses;•difficulty or delay integrating acquired technologies, operations, systems and infrastructure, and personnel with our existing businesses;•strain on managerial and operational resources as management tries to oversee larger or more complex operations;•the future funding requirements for acquired companies, including research and development costs, employee compensation and benefits, and operating expenses, which may be significant;•servicing significant debt that may be incurred in connection with acquisitions; •potential loss of key employees;•exposure to unforeseen liabilities or regulatory compliance issues of acquired companies; •higher than expected or unexpected costs relating to or associated with an acquisition and integration of assets and businesses;•difficulty realizing expected cost savings, operating synergies and growth prospects of an acquisition in a timely manner or at all; and•increased risk of costly and time-consuming legal proceedings.If we are unable to successfully address these risks, we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of our acquisitions, which may have an adverse effect on our business strategy, plans and operating results.We rely on supplies, services and manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable areas, which could affect our ability to produce products.We, like many companies in the semiconductor industry, rely on supplies, services, internal manufacturing capacity, wafer fabrication foundries and other subcontractors in geologically unstable locations around the world. Earthquakes, tsunamis, flooding or other natural disasters may disrupt local semiconductor-related businesses and adversely affect manufacturing capacity, availability and cost of key raw materials, utilities and equipment, and availability of key services, including transport of our products worldwide.  Our insurance may not adequately cover losses resulting from such disruptions.  Any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities, or those of our subcontractors or third-party wafer fabrication foundries, as a result of fire, flood, natural disaster, unavailability of utilities or otherwise, could result in a temporary or permanent loss of customers for affected products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Our operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors.A significant portion of our sales are through independent global and regional distributors that are not under our control.  These independent distributors generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts for our products or they could terminate their representation of us. We generally do not require letters of credit from our distributors, including our largest distributor, and are not protected against accounts receivable default or declarations of bankruptcy by these distributors. Our inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our operating results. Termination of a significant distributor or a group of distributors, whether at our initiative or the distributor’s initiative or through consolidation in the distribution industry, could disrupt our current business, and if we are unable to find suitable replacements with the appropriate scale and resources, our operating results could be adversely affected.19We are  required to estimate the effects of returns and allowances provided to distributors and record revenue at the time of sale to the distributor.   If our estimates of such credits and rights are materially understated, it could cause subsequent adjustments that negatively impact our revenues and gross profits in a future period.Our stock price may be volatile.The market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future, as it may be significantly affected by factors including:•the extent of the impact and the duration of the COVID-19 outbreak;•global economic conditions generally;•crises in global credit, debt and financial markets;•actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and operating results;•changes in financial estimates or other statements made by securities analysts or others in analyst reports or other publications, or our failure to perform in line with those estimates or statements or our published guidance;•financial results and prospects of our customers;•U.S. and foreign government actions, including with respect to trade, travel, export and taxation;•changes in market valuations of other semiconductor companies;•rumors and speculation in the press, investment community or on social media about us, our customers or other companies in our industry;•announcements by us, our customers or our competitors of significant new products, technical innovations, material transactions, acquisitions or dispositions, litigation, capital commitments, including share repurchases and dividend policies, or revised earnings estimates;•departures of key personnel;•alleged noncompliance with laws, regulations or ethics standards by us or any of our employees, officers or directors; and•negative media publicity targeting us or our suppliers, customers or competitors.The stock market has historically experienced volatility, especially within the semiconductor industry, that often has been unrelated to the performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless of our operating results.Our directors and executive officers periodically buy or sell shares of our common stock in the market, including pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans.  Regardless of the individual's reasons for such purchases or sales, securities analysts and investors could view such transactions as positive or negative indicators and our stock price could be adversely affected as a result.Risks Related to our IndebtednessIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow, we may not be able to service our debt obligations, including making payments on our outstanding indebtedness.Our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness when due depends upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations, many of which are beyond our control.  For example, the disruption to economic activity resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has had, and is likely to continue to have, adverse effects on our supply chain, manufacturing operations and facilities, and workforce.  If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our outstanding debt, we may be required to, among other things:•seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets;•refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness;•borrow under our revolving credit facility;•divert funds that would otherwise be invested in growing our business operations;•repatriate earnings as dividends from foreign locations with potential for negative tax consequences; or•sell selected assets. 20Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt, which could negatively impact our financial results. In addition, we may not be able to obtain any such financing, refinancing or complete a sale of assets on economically favorable terms. In the case of financing or refinancing, favorable interest rates will depend on the health of the debt capital markets.Restrictions in our revolving credit facility, term loan and outstanding debt instruments may limit our activities.Our current revolving credit facility, term loan and outstanding debt instruments impose, and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may impose, restrictions that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our Company, including to undertake certain transactions, to create certain liens on our assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness. Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as changes in technology, government regulations and the level of competition in our markets. In addition, our revolving credit facility and term loan require us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. If we breach any of the covenants under our revolving credit facility, the indentures governing our outstanding senior unsecured notes, the term loan facility or any future debt instruments to which we may become subject and do not obtain appropriate waivers, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness thereunder could be declared immediately due and payable and/or we may be restricted from further borrowing under our revolving credit facility.Risks Related to Legal, Regulatory and Compliance MattersWe may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary intellectual property rights, which may limit our ability to compete effectively.Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We primarily rely on patent, mask work, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure agreements, information security practices, and other methods, to protect our proprietary information, technologies and processes. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain or disclose our confidential information, reverse engineer or copy our technologies, products or processes, or otherwise misappropriate our intellectual property. Moreover, the laws of foreign countries in which we design, manufacture, market and sell our products may afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property.There can be no assurance that the claims allowed in our issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. In addition, any of our existing or future patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. As such, any rights granted under these patents may not prevent others from exploiting our proprietary technology. We may not be able to obtain foreign patents or pending applications corresponding to our U.S. patents and applications. Even if patents are granted, we may not be able to effectively enforce our rights. If our patents and mask works do not adequately protect our technology, or if our registrations expire prior to end of life of our products, our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours. Our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents.We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and strategic partners. We also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies, documentation and other proprietary information. Despite these efforts, internal or external parties may attempt to copy, disclose, obtain or use our products or technology without our authorization. Also, former employees may seek employment with our business partners, customers or competitors, and there can be no assurance that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment.A significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems or certain of our products could materially and adversely affect our business or reputation.We rely on information technology systems throughout our company to keep financial records and customer data, process orders, manage inventory, coordinate shipments to customers, maintain confidential and proprietary information, assist in semiconductor engineering and other technical activities and operate other critical functions such as Internet connectivity, network communications and email. Our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, employee malfeasance, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, many of our employees and directors are temporarily working remotely, which may pose additional data security risks.  We also rely upon external cloud providers for certain infrastructure activities. If we were to experience a prolonged disruption in the information technology systems that involve our internal communications or our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business. We may also be subject to security breaches of our information technology systems and certain of our products caused by viruses, illegal break-ins or hacking, sabotage, or acts of vandalism by third parties or our employees or contractors.  Our security measures or those of our third-party service providers 21may not detect or prevent security breaches, defects, bugs or errors.  In addition, we provide our confidential and proprietary information to our strategic partners in certain cases where doing so is necessary to conduct our business.  Those third parties may be subject to security breaches or otherwise compromise the protection of such information.  Security breaches of our information technology systems or those of our partners could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential and proprietary information belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers, suppliers, or other third parties which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage.We are occasionally involved in litigation, including claims regarding intellectual property rights, which could be costly to litigate and could require us to redesign products or pay significant royalties.The semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights. Other companies or individuals have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes, and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling infringing products, if those patents are found to be valid and infringed by us. In the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property, and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement, and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel. We could also be subject to litigation or arbitration disputes arising under our contractual obligations, as well as customer indemnity, warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant costs and expenses as we defend those claims or pay damage awards. There can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities, and we may elect to self-insure with respect to certain matters. An adverse outcome in litigation or arbitration could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or on our operating results or cash flows in the period in which the dispute is resolved.We are subject to environmental, health and safety (EHS) regulations, which could increase our expenses and affect our operating results.Our industry is subject to EHS requirements, particularly those that control and restrict the sourcing, use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage and disposal of certain substances, and materials used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process. Public attention to environmental sustainability and social responsibility concerns continues to increase, and our customers routinely include stringent environmental and other standards in their contracts with us. Changes in EHS laws or regulations may require us to invest in costly equipment or make manufacturing process changes and may adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products. In addition, we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability for damages caused by potential or actual releases of such materials. Any failure to control such materials adequately or to comply with existing or future EHS statutory or regulatory standards, requirements or contractual obligations could result in any of the following, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results:•liability for damages and remediation; •the imposition of regulatory penalties and civil and criminal fines; •the suspension or termination of the development, manufacture, sale or use of certain of our products; •changes to our manufacturing processes or a need to substitute materials that may cost more or be less available;•damage to our reputation; and/or •increased expenses associated with compliance.If we fail to comply with government contracting regulations, we could suffer a loss of revenue or incur price adjustments or other penalties.Some of our revenue is derived from contracts with agencies of the United States government and subcontracts with its prime contractors. As a United States government contractor or subcontractor, we are subject to federal contracting regulations, including the Federal Acquisition Regulations, which govern the allowability of costs incurred by us in the performance of United States government contracts. Certain contract pricing is based on estimated direct and indirect costs, which are subject to change. Additionally, the United States government is entitled after final payment on certain negotiated contracts to examine all of our cost records with respect to such contracts and to seek a downward adjustment to the price of the contract if it determines that we failed to furnish complete, accurate and current cost or pricing data in connection with the negotiation of the price of the contract.In connection with our United States government business, we are also subject to government audits and to review and approval of our policies, procedures, and internal controls for compliance with procurement regulations and applicable laws, 22such as the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification. In certain circumstances, if we do not comply with the terms of a contract or with regulations or statutes, we could be subject to downward contract price adjustments or refund obligations or could in extreme circumstances be assessed civil and criminal penalties or be debarred or suspended from obtaining future contracts for a specified period of time. Any such suspension or debarment or other sanction could have an adverse effect on our business.Under some of our government subcontracts, we are required to maintain secure facilities and to obtain security clearances for personnel involved in performance of the contract, in compliance with applicable federal standards. If we were unable to comply with these requirements, or if personnel critical to our performance of these contracts were unable to obtain or maintain their security clearances, we might be unable to perform these contracts or compete for other projects of this nature, which could adversely affect our revenue"
7,ADI,ANALOG DEVICES,2019-11-26,"ITEM 1A.      RISK FACTORSSet forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are descriptions of certain risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements in this report.  Political and economic uncertainty as well as disruptions in global credit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.Continuing political and global macroeconomic uncertainty, including escalating trade disputes between the United States and China, the United Kingdom's pending withdrawal from the European Union, and uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets may lead consumers and businesses to postpone or reduce spending, which may cause our customers to cancel, decrease or delay their existing and future orders for our products and make it difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities.  Financial difficulties experienced by our customers could result in nonpayment or payment delays for previously purchased products, thereby increasing our credit risk exposure.  Uncertainty regarding the macroeconomic conditions as well as the future stability of the global credit and financial markets could cause the value of the currency in the affected markets to deteriorate, thus reducing the purchasing power of those customers. Significant disruption to global credit and financial markets may also adversely affect our ability to access external financing sources on acceptable terms.  In addition, financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers, distributors or customers could result in product delays, increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges. If economic conditions deteriorate, we may record additional charges relating to restructuring costs or the impairment of assets and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.We are exposed to business, economic, political, legal, regulatory and other risks through our significant worldwide operations, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We have significant operations and manufacturing facilities outside the United States, including in Ireland, the Philippines, Singapore and Malaysia. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from customers in international markets, and we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the future.  Risks associated with our international business operations include the following:•political, legal and economic changes, crises or instability and civil unrest in markets in which we do business, including potential macroeconomic weakness related to escalating trade disputes between the United States and China and the United Kingdom's pending withdrawal from the European Union;•compliance requirements of U.S. customs and export regulations, including the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and the International Traffic and Arms Regulations (ITAR);•currency conversion risks and exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations, including the potential impact of the transition from LIBOR;•trade policy, commercial, travel, export or taxation disputes or restrictions, government sanctions, import or export tariffs, changes to export classifications or other restrictions imposed by the U.S. government or by the governments of the countries in which we do business, particularly in China; •complex, varying and changing government regulations and legal standards and requirements, particularly with respect to tax regulations, price protection, competition practices, export control regulations and restrictions, customs and tax requirements, immigration, anti-boycott regulations, data privacy, intellectual property, anti-corruption and environmental compliance, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;•economic disruption from terrorism and threats of terrorism and the response to them by the U.S. and its allies;•increased managerial complexities, including different employment practices and labor issues;•changes in immigration laws, regulations and procedures and enforcement practices of various government agencies;•greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting such rights;•natural disasters or pandemics;•transportation disruptions and delays and increases in labor and transportation costs;•changes to foreign taxes, tariffs and freight rates;•fluctuations in raw material costs and energy costs;•greater difficulty in accounts receivable collections and longer collection periods; and•costs associated with our foreign defined benefit pension plans.10Any of these risks, or any other risks related to international business operations, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Many of these risks are present within our business operations in China.  For example, changes in U.S.-China relations, the political environment or international trade policies and relations could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of import or export duties and tariffs, restrictions on imports or exports, currency revaluations, or retaliatory actions, which has had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results.  In addition, our success in the Chinese markets may be adversely affected by China's continuously evolving policies, laws and regulations, including those relating to antitrust, cybersecurity and data protection, the environment, indigenous innovation and the promotion of a domestic semiconductor industry, and intellectual property rights and enforcement and protection of those rights.  At November 2, 2019, our principal source of liquidity was $648.3 million of cash and cash equivalents, of which approximately $295.7 million was held in the United States and the remaining balance was held outside the United States.  As we intend to reinvest substantially all of our foreign earnings indefinitely, certain cash held outside the United States may not be available for repatriation as dividends to the United States in the future. We require a substantial amount of cash in the United States for operating requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends and acquisitions. If we are unable to address our U.S. cash requirements through operations, borrowings under our current revolving credit facility, future debt or equity offerings or other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost, it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of earnings that are indefinitely reinvested, and we may be required to pay additional taxes under current tax laws, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Our future revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate.Our future revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors, including:•the effects of adverse economic conditions in the markets in which we sell our products;•changes in customer demand or order patterns for our products and/or for end products that incorporate our products;•the timing, delay, reduction or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability to manage inventory;•our ability to accurately forecast distributor demand for our products;•our ability to accurately estimate future distributor pricing credits and/or stock rotation rights;•our ability to effectively manage our cost structure in both the short term and over a longer duration;•changes in geographic, product or customer mix;•changes in our effective tax rates or new or revised tax legislation in the United States, Ireland or worldwide; •the effects of issued, threatened or retaliatory government sanctions, trade barriers or economic restrictions, changes in law, regulations or other restrictions, including executive orders, changes in import and export regulations, export classifications or changes in duties and tariffs, particularly with respect to China; •the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us, our customers or our competitors and the market acceptance of such products;•pricing decisions and competitive pricing pressures;•fluctuations in manufacturing yields, adequate availability of wafers and other raw materials, and manufacturing, assembly and test capacity;•the ability of our third-party suppliers, subcontractors and manufacturers to supply us with sufficient quantities of raw materials, products and/or components;•a decline in infrastructure spending by foreign governments, including China;•a decline in the U.S. government defense budget, changes in spending or budgetary priorities, a prolonged U.S. government shutdown or delays in contract awards;•any significant decline in our backlog;•our ability to recruit, hire, retain and motivate adequate numbers of engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of our customers;•our ability to generate new design opportunities and win competitive bid selection processes;•the increasing costs of providing employee benefits worldwide, including health insurance, retirement plan and pension plan contributions and retirement benefits; 11•our ability to utilize our manufacturing facilities at efficient levels;•potential significant litigation-related costs or product liability, warranty and/or indemnity claims, including those not covered by our suppliers or insurers;•the difficulties inherent in forecasting future operating expense levels, including with respect to costs associated with labor, utilities, transportation and raw materials;•the costs related to compliance with increasing worldwide government, environmental and social responsibility standards; •new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting standards and practices; and•the effects of public health emergencies, natural disasters, widespread travel disruptions, security risks, terrorist activities, international conflicts and other events beyond our control.In addition, the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic upturns and downturns. Our business and certain of the end markets we serve are also subject to rapid technological changes and material fluctuations in demand based on end-user preferences.  There can be no assurance (i) that products stocked in our inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them, or (ii) that we will be able to design, develop and produce products in a timely fashion to accommodate changing customer demand. As a result of these and other factors, we may experience material fluctuations in future revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share on a quarterly or annual basis.  Our historical financial performance and results of operations should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance or results.  In addition, if our revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share results or expectations do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the market price of our common stock may decline. Increases in our effective tax rate and exposure to additional tax liabilities may adversely impact our results of operations.Our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned.  Our effective tax rate for the fiscal year ended November 2, 2019 was below our U.S. federal statutory rate of 21%.  It was also below our blended U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 23.4% for the fiscal year ended November 3, 2018.  This is primarily due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income. A number of factors may increase our future effective tax rate, including: new or revised tax laws or legislation or the interpretation of such laws or legislation by governmental authorities; increases in tax rates in various jurisdictions; variation in the mix of jurisdictions in which our profits are earned and taxed; deferred taxes arising from basis differences in investments in foreign subsidiaries; any adverse resolution of ongoing tax audits or adverse rulings from taxing authorities worldwide, including our current transfer pricing appeal in Ireland; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including executive compensation subject to the limitations of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code and amortization of assets acquired in connection with strategic transactions; decreased availability of tax deductions for stock-based compensation awards worldwide; and changes in available tax credits. In addition, we have a partial tax holiday through July 2025 in Malaysia. The ability to extend such tax holiday beyond its expiration date cannot be assured. In addition, if we fail to meet certain conditions of the tax holiday, we may lose the benefit of the tax holiday and/or be subject to additional taxes and/or penalties. Any significant increase in our future effective tax rate could adversely impact our net income during future periods.Compliance with the Tax Legislation may require the collection of information not regularly produced within the Company, and therefore necessitate the use of estimates in our Consolidated Financial Statements and the exercise of significant judgment in accounting for its provisions. As regulations and guidance evolve with respect to the Tax Legislation, and as more information is gathered and analyzed, our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our Consolidated Financial Statements.We are also subject to laws and regulations in various jurisdictions that determine how much profit has been earned and when it is subject to taxation in that jurisdiction. Changes in these laws and regulations, including those that align to or are associated with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Actions Plans, could impact the jurisdictions where we are deemed to earn income, which could in turn adversely affect our tax liability and results of operations.12We may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary intellectual property rights, which may limit our ability to compete effectively.Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We primarily rely on patent, mask work, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure agreements, information security practices, and other methods, to protect our proprietary information, technologies and processes. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain or disclose our confidential information, reverse engineer or copy our technologies, products or processes, or otherwise misappropriate our intellectual property. Moreover, the laws of foreign countries in which we design, manufacture, market and sell our products may afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property.There can be no assurance that the claims allowed in our issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. In addition, any of our existing or future patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. As such, any rights granted under these patents may not prevent others from exploiting our proprietary technology. We may not be able to obtain foreign patents or pending applications corresponding to our U.S. patents and applications. Even if patents are granted, we may not be able to effectively enforce our rights. If our patents and mask works do not adequately protect our technology, or if our registrations expire prior to end of life of our products, our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours. Our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents.We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and strategic partners. We also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies, documentation and other proprietary information. Despite these efforts, internal or external parties may attempt to copy, disclose, obtain or use our products or technology without our authorization. Also, former employees may seek employment with our business partners, customers or competitors, and there can be no assurance that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment.A significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems or certain of our products could materially and adversely affect our business or reputation.We rely on information technology systems throughout our company to keep financial records and customer data, process orders, manage inventory, coordinate shipments to customers, maintain confidential and proprietary information, assist in semiconductor engineering and other technical activities and operate other critical functions such as Internet connectivity, network communications and email.  Our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, employee malfeasance, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events.   We also rely upon external cloud providers for certain infrastructure activities. If we were to experience a prolonged disruption in the information technology systems that involve our internal communications or our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business. We may also be subject to security breaches of our information technology systems and certain of our products caused by viruses, illegal break-ins or hacking, sabotage, or acts of vandalism by third parties or our employees or contractors.  Our security measures or those of our third party service providers may not detect or prevent security breaches, defects, bugs or errors.  In addition, we provide our confidential and proprietary information to our strategic partners in certain cases where doing so is necessary to conduct our business.  While we employ confidentiality agreements to protect such information, those third parties may nonetheless also be subject to security breaches or otherwise compromise the protection of such information.  Security breaches of our information technology systems or those of our partners could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential and proprietary information belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers, suppliers, or other third parties which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage.Our customers typically do not make long-term product purchase commitments and incorrect forecasts or reductions, cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results.We typically do not have sales contracts with our customers that include long-term product purchase commitments. In certain markets where end-user demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict, some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment, even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all, or even any, of the product. In other instances, we manufacture product based on non-binding forecasts of customer demands, which may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis and at times may prove to be inaccurate. Additionally, our U.S. government contracts and subcontracts may be funded in increments over a number of government budget periods and typically can be terminated by the government for its convenience.  As a result, we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales, and we are subject to the risk of lower than expected orders or cancellations of orders, leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog. Further, if orders or forecasts for products that meet a customer’s unique requirements  are canceled or unrealized we may be left with an inventory of unsaleable products, causing potential inventory write-offs, and hindering our ability to recover our costs. As a result of lengthy manufacturing 13cycles for certain of the products that are subject to these uncertainties, the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial. Incorrect forecasts, or reductions, cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results.Our future success depends upon our ability to execute our business strategy, continue to innovate, improve our existing products, design, develop, produce and market new products, and identify and enter new markets.Our future success significantly depends on our ability to execute our business strategy, continue to innovate, improve our existing products and design, develop, produce and market innovative new products and system-level solutions. Product design, development, innovation and enhancement is often a complex, time-consuming and costly process involving significant investment in research and development, with no assurance of return on investment. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new and improved products in a timely or efficient manner or that new and improved products, if developed, will achieve market acceptance. Our products generally must conform to various evolving and sometimes competing industry standards, which may adversely affect our ability to compete in certain markets or require us to incur significant costs. In addition, our customers generally impose very high quality and reliability standards on our products, which often change and may be difficult or costly to satisfy. Any inability to satisfy customer quality and reliability standards or comply with industry standards and technical requirements may adversely affect demand for our products and our results of operations. Our growth is also dependent on our ability to identify and penetrate new markets where we have limited experience yet require significant investments, resources and technological advancements in order to compete effectively and there can be no assurance that we will achieve success in these markets.  There can be no assurance that the markets we serve and/or target based on our business strategy will grow in the future, that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets, that our products, or the end-products in which our products are used, will achieve customer acceptance in these markets, that competitors will not force price reductions or take market share from us, or that we can achieve or maintain adequate gross margins or profits in these markets.  We may not be able to compete successfully in markets within the semiconductor industry in the future.We face intense competition in the semiconductor industry, and we expect this competition to increase in the future, including from companies located outside of the United States. Competition is generally based on innovation, design, quality and reliability of products, product performance, features and functionality, product pricing, availability and capacity, technological service and support, and the availability of integrated system solutions, with the relative importance of these factors varying among products, markets and customers. Many companies have sufficient financial, manufacturing, technical, sales and marketing resources to develop and market products that compete with our products. Some of our competitors may have more advantageous supply or development relationships with our current and potential customers or suppliers. Our competitors also include both emerging companies selling specialized products in markets we serve and companies outside of the U.S., including entities associated with well-funded efforts by foreign governments to create indigenous semiconductor industries.  Existing or new competitors may develop products or technologies that more effectively address the demands of our customers and markets with enhanced performance, features and functionality, lower power requirements, greater levels of integration or lower cost. In addition, as we seek to expand our business, including the design and production of products and services for developing and emerging markets, we may encounter increased competition from our current competitors and/or new competitors.  Increased competition in certain markets has resulted in and may continue to result in declining average selling prices, reduced gross margins and loss of market share in those markets. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors, or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased competition.  In addition, the semiconductor industry has experienced significant consolidation over the past several years.  Consolidation among our competitors could lead to a changing competitive landscape, which could negatively impact our competitive position and market share and harm our results of operations.We rely on third-parties for supply of raw materials and parts, semiconductor wafer foundry services, assembly and test services, and transportation, among other things, and we generally cannot control their availability or conditions of supply or services.We rely, and plan to continue to rely, on third-party suppliers and service providers, including raw material and components suppliers, semiconductor wafer foundries, assembly and test contractors, and freight carriers (collectively, vendors) in manufacturing our products. This reliance involves several risks, including reduced control over availability, capacity utilization, delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, and costs. We currently source approximately half of our wafer requirements annually from third-party wafer foundries, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and others.  These foundries often provide wafer foundry services to our competitors and therefore periods of increased industry demand may result in capacity constraints. In addition, in certain instances, one of our vendors may be the sole source of highly specialized processing services or materials. If such vendor is unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver components to us on the time schedule and of the quality or quantity that we require, we may be forced to seek to engage an additional or replacement vendor, which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our 14customers. If additional or replacement vendors are not available, we may also experience delays in product development or shipment which could, in turn, result in the temporary or permanent loss of customers.A prolonged disruption of our internal manufacturing operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.In addition to leveraging an outsourcing model for manufacturing operations, we also rely on our internal manufacturing operations located in the United States, Ireland, the Philippines, Singapore and Malaysia. A prolonged disruption at, or inability to utilize, one or more of our manufacturing facilities, loss of raw materials or damage to our manufacturing equipment for any reason, including due to natural or man-made disasters, civil unrest or other events outside of our control, such as widespread outbreaks of illness or the failure to maintain our labor force at one or more of these facilities, may disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in us being unable to timely satisfy customer demand. As a result, we could forgo revenue opportunities, potentially lose market share and damage our customer relationships, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow, we may not be able to service our debt obligations, including making payments on our outstanding indebtedness.Our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness when due depends upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our outstanding debt, we may be required to, among other things:•seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets;•refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness;•borrow under our revolving credit facility;•divert funds that would otherwise be invested in growing our business operations;•repatriate earnings as dividends from foreign locations with potential for negative tax consequences; or•sell selected assets. Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt, which could negatively impact our financial results. In addition, we may not be able to obtain any such financing, refinancing or complete a sale of assets on economically favorable terms. In the case of financing or refinancing, favorable interest rates will depend on the health of the debt capital markets.The markets for semiconductor products are cyclical, and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices, and conversely, we may not be able to satisfy unexpected demand for our products.The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly.  The demand for our products is subject to the strength of our four major end markets of Industrial, Communications, Automotive and Consumer.  If we expand our operations and workforce too rapidly or procure excessive resources in anticipation of increased demand for our products, and that demand does not materialize at the pace at which we expect, or declines, or if we overbuild inventory in a period of decreased demand, our operating results may be adversely affected as a result of increased operating expenses, reduced margins, underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges. These capacity expansions by us and other semiconductor manufacturers could also lead to overcapacity in our target markets which could lead to price erosion that would adversely impact our operating results. Conversely, during periods of rapid increases in demand, our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy the demand. In addition, we may not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner, procure adequate resources and raw materials, locate suitable third-party suppliers, or respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to demand for new products requested by our customers, and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected.Our semiconductor products are complex and we may be subject to warranty, indemnity and/or product liability claims, which could result in significant costs and damage to our reputation and adversely affect customer relationships, the market acceptance of our products and our operating results.Semiconductor products are highly complex and may contain defects that affect their quality or performance. Failures in our products and services or in the products of our customers could result in damage to our reputation for reliability and increase our legal or financial exposure to third parties. Certain of our products and services could also contain security vulnerabilities, defects, bugs and errors, which could also result in significant data losses, security breaches and theft of intellectual property. We generally warrant that our products will meet their published specifications, and that we will repair or replace defective products, for one year from the date title passes from us to the customer. We invest significant resources in the 15testing of our products; however, if any of our products contain defects, we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders. These problems may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or others, including liability for costs and expenses associated with product defects, including recalls, which may adversely impact our operating results. We may also be subject to customer intellectual property indemnity claims. Our customers have on occasion been sued, and may be sued in the future, by third parties alleging infringement of intellectual property rights, or damages resulting from use of our products. Those customers may seek indemnification from us under the terms and conditions of our sales contracts with them. In certain cases, our potential indemnification liability may be significant. Further, we sell to customers in industries such as automotive (including autonomous vehicles), aerospace, defense, and healthcare, where failure of the systems in which our products are integrated could cause damage to property or persons. We may be subject to product liability claims if our products, or the integration of our products, cause system failures. Any product liability claim, whether or not determined in our favor, could result in significant expense, divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, and harm our business.  In addition, if any of our products contain defects, or have reliability, quality or compatibility problems not capable of being resolved, our reputation may be damaged, which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to customers and which could also adversely affect our operating results.The fabrication of integrated circuits is highly complex and precise, and our manufacturing processes utilize a substantial amount of technology. Minute impurities, contaminants in the manufacturing environment, difficulties in the fabrication process, defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process, manufacturing equipment failures, wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional. While we have significant expertise in semiconductor manufacturing, it is possible that some processes could become unstable. This instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.We are occasionally involved in litigation, including claims regarding intellectual property rights, which could be costly to litigate and could require us to redesign products or pay significant royalties.The semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights. Other companies or individuals have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes, and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling infringing products, if those patents are found to be valid and infringed by us. In the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property, and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement, and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel. We could also be subject to litigation or arbitration disputes arising under our contractual obligations, as well as customer indemnity, warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant costs and expenses as we defend those claims or pay damage awards. There can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities, and we may elect to self-insure with respect to certain matters. An adverse outcome in litigation or arbitration could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or on our operating results or cash flows in the period in which the dispute is resolved.If we are unable to recruit or retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our business strategy will be adversely affected.Our continued success depends to a significant extent upon the recruitment, retention and effective succession of our key personnel, including our leadership team, management and technical personnel, particularly our experienced engineers. The competition for these employees is intense. The loss of key personnel or the inability to attract, hire and retain key employees with critical technical skills to achieve our strategy, including as a result of changes to immigration policies, could also have a material adverse effect on our business. We do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or other employees.16To remain competitive, we may need to invest in or acquire other companies, purchase or license technology from third parties, or enter into other strategic transactions in order to introduce new products or enhance our existing products.An element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisitions of businesses, assets, products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings, diversify our product portfolio, expand our market coverage, increase our engineering workforce, expand our technical skill sets or enhance our technological capabilities. We may not be able to find businesses that have the technology or resources we need and, if we find such businesses, we may not be able to invest in, purchase or license the technology or resources on commercially favorable terms or at all. Acquisitions, investments and technology licenses are challenging to complete for a number of reasons, including difficulties in identifying potential targets, the cost of potential transactions, competition among prospective buyers and licensees, the need for regulatory approvals, and difficulties related to integration efforts.  In addition, investments in private companies are subject to a risk of a partial or total loss of our investment.  Both in the U.S. and abroad, governmental regulation of acquisitions, including antitrust and other regulatory reviews and approvals, has become more complex, increasing the costs and risks of undertaking and consummating significant acquisitions. In order to finance a potential transaction, we may need to raise additional funds by issuing securities or borrowing money. We may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms, and the sale of our stock may result in the dilution of our existing shareholders or the issuance of securities with rights that are superior to the rights of our common shareholders.Acquisitions also involve a number of challenges and risks, including:•diversion of management’s attention in connection with both negotiating the transaction and integrating the acquired assets and businesses;•difficulty or delay integrating acquired technologies, operations, systems and infrastructure, and personnel with our existing businesses;•strain on managerial and operational resources as management tries to oversee larger or more complex operations;•the future funding requirements for acquired companies, including research and development costs, employee compensation and benefits, and operating expenses, which may be significant;•servicing significant debt that may be incurred in connection with acquisitions; •potential loss of key employees;•exposure to unforeseen liabilities or regulatory compliance issues of acquired companies; •higher than expected or unexpected costs relating to or associated with an acquisition and integration of assets and businesses;•difficulty realizing expected cost savings, operating synergies and growth prospects of an acquisition in a timely manner or at all; and•increased risk of costly and time-consuming legal proceedings.If we are unable to successfully address these risks, we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of our acquisitions, which may have an adverse effect on our business strategy, plans and operating results.We rely on supplies, services and manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable areas, which could affect our ability to produce products.We, like many companies in the semiconductor industry, rely on supplies, services, internal manufacturing capacity, wafer fabrication foundries and other subcontractors in geologically unstable locations around the world. Earthquakes, tsunamis, flooding or other natural disasters may disrupt local semiconductor-related businesses and adversely affect manufacturing capacity, availability and cost of key raw materials, utilities and equipment, and availability of key services, including transport of our products worldwide.  Our insurance may not adequately cover losses resulting from such disruptions.  Any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities, or those of our subcontractors or third-party wafer fabrication foundries, as a result of fire, flood, natural disaster, unavailability of utilities or otherwise, could result in a temporary or permanent loss of customers for affected products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Our operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors.A significant portion of our sales are through independent global and regional distributors that are not under our control. Arrow Electronics is currently our largest distributor. These independent distributors generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts for our products or they could terminate their representation of us. We generally do not require letters of credit from our distributors, including our largest distributor, and are not protected against accounts receivable default or declarations of bankruptcy by these distributors. Our inability to collect open accounts 17receivable could adversely affect our operating results. Termination of a significant distributor or a group of distributors, whether at our initiative or the distributor’s initiative or through consolidation in the distribution industry, could disrupt our current business, and if we are unable to find suitable replacements with the appropriate scale and resources, our operating results could be adversely affected.Effective November 4, 2018, all distributor sales are recognized upon shipment to the distributor under Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09). We are now required to estimate the effects of returns and allowances provided to distributors and record revenue at the time of sale to the distributor.   If our estimates of such credits and rights are materially understated, it could cause subsequent adjustments that negatively impact our revenues and gross profits in a future period.We are subject to environmental, health and safety (EHS) regulations, which could increase our expenses and affect our operating results.Our industry is subject to EHS requirements, particularly those that control and restrict the sourcing, use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage and disposal of certain substances, and materials used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process. Public attention to environmental sustainability and social responsibility concerns continues to increase, and our customers routinely include stringent environmental and other standards in their contract with us. Changes in EHS laws or regulations may require us to invest in costly equipment or make manufacturing process changes and may adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products. In addition, we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability for damages caused by potential or actual releases of such materials. Any failure to control such materials adequately or to comply with existing or future EHS statutory or regulatory standards, requirements or contractual obligations could result in any of the following, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results:•liability for damages and remediation; •the imposition of regulatory penalties and civil and criminal fines; •the suspension or termination of the development, manufacture, sale or use of certain of our products; •changes to our manufacturing processes or a need to substitute materials that may cost more or be less available;•damage to our reputation; and/or •increased expenses associated with compliance.Restrictions in our revolving credit facility, term loan and outstanding debt instruments may limit our activities.Our current revolving credit facility, term loan and outstanding debt instruments impose, and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may impose, restrictions that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our Company, including to undertake certain transactions, to create certain liens on our assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness. Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as changes in technology, government regulations and the level of competition in our markets. In addition, our revolving credit facility and term loan require us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. If we breach any of the covenants under our revolving credit facility, the indentures governing our outstanding senior unsecured notes, the term loan facility or any future debt instruments to which we may become subject and do not obtain appropriate waivers, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness thereunder could be declared immediately due and payable and/or we may be restricted from further borrowing under our revolving credit facility.If we fail to comply with government contracting regulations, we could suffer a loss of revenue or incur price adjustments or other penalties.Some of our revenue is derived from contracts with agencies of the United States government and subcontracts with its prime contractors. As a United States government contractor or subcontractor, we are subject to federal contracting regulations, including the Federal Acquisition Regulations, which govern the allowability of costs incurred by us in the performance of United States government contracts. Certain contract pricing is based on estimated direct and indirect costs, which are subject to change. Additionally, the United States government is entitled after final payment on certain negotiated contracts to examine all of our cost records with respect to such contracts and to seek a downward adjustment to the price of the contract if it determines that we failed to furnish complete, accurate and current cost or pricing data in connection with the negotiation of the price of the contract.In connection with our United States government business, we are also subject to government audits and to review and approval of our policies, procedures, and internal controls for compliance with procurement regulations and applicable laws. In certain circumstances, if we do not comply with the terms of a contract or with regulations or statutes, we could be subject to 18downward contract price adjustments or refund obligations or could in extreme circumstances be assessed civil and criminal penalties or be debarred or suspended from obtaining future contracts for a specified period of time. Any such suspension or debarment or other sanction could have an adverse effect on our business.Under some of our government subcontracts, we are required to maintain secure facilities and to obtain security clearances for personnel involved in performance of the contract, in compliance with applicable federal standards. If we were unable to comply with these requirements, or if personnel critical to our performance of these contracts were unable to obtain or maintain their security clearances, we might be unable to perform these contracts or compete for other projects of this nature, which could adversely affect our revenue.Our stock price may be volatile.The market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future, as it may be significantly affected by factors including:•global economic conditions generally;•crises in global credit, debt and financial markets;•actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and operating results;•changes in financial estimates or other statements made by securities analysts or others in analyst reports or other publications or our failure to perform in line with those estimates or statements or our published guidance;•financial results and prospects of our customers;•U.S. and foreign government actions, including with respect to trade, travel, export and taxation;•changes in market valuations of other semiconductor companies;•rumors and speculation in the press, investment community or on social media about us, our customers or other companies in our industry;•announcements by us, our customers or our competitors of significant new products, technical innovations, material transactions, acquisitions or dispositions, litigation, capital commitments or revised earnings estimates;•departures of key personnel;•alleged noncompliance with laws, regulations or ethics standards by us or any of our employees, officers or directors; and•negative media publicity targeting us or our suppliers, customers or competitors.The stock market has historically experienced volatility, especially within the semiconductor industry, that often has been unrelated to the performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless of our operating results.Our directors and executive officers periodically sell shares of our common stock in the market, including pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans.  Regardless of the individual's reasons for such sales, securities analysts and investors could view such sales as a negative indicator and our stock price could be adversely affected as a result"
4,ADI,ANALOG DEVICES,2018-11-27,"ITEM 1A.     RISK FACTORSSet forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the SEC are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report.Disruptions in global credit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.Continuing uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets may lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending, which may cause our customers to cancel, decrease or delay their existing and future orders for our products and make it difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities.  Significant disruption to global credit and financial markets may also adversely affect our ability to access external financing sources on acceptable terms.  Financial difficulties experienced by our customers could result in nonpayment or payment delays for previously purchased products, thereby increasing our credit risk exposure.  Uncertainty regarding the future stability of the global credit and financial markets could cause the value of the currency in the affected markets to deteriorate, thus reducing the purchasing power of those customers. In addition, financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers, distributors or customers could result in product delays, increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges. If economic conditions deteriorate, we may record additional charges relating to restructuring costs or the impairment of assets and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.Our future revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate.Our future revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors, including:•the effects of adverse economic conditions in the markets in which we sell our products;•changes in customer demand for our products and/or for end products that incorporate our products;•the timing, delay, reduction or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability to manage inventory;•fluctuations in customer order patterns and seasonality;•our ability to accurately forecast distributor demand for our products;•our ability to accurately estimate future distributor pricing credits and/or stock rotation rights;•our ability to effectively manage our cost structure in both the short term and over a longer duration;•changes in geographic, product or customer mix;•changes in our effective tax rates or new or revised tax legislation in the United States, Ireland or worldwide; •the effects of issued, threatened or retaliatory government sanctions, trade barriers or economic restrictions, changes in law, regulations or other restrictions, including executive orders, changes in import and export regulations or changes in duties and tariffs, particularly with respect to China; •the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us, our customers or our competitors and the market acceptance of such products;•pricing decisions and competitive pricing pressures;•fluctuations in manufacturing yields, adequate availability of wafers and other raw materials, and manufacturing, assembly and test capacity;•the ability of our third-party suppliers, subcontractors and manufacturers to supply us with sufficient quantities of raw materials, products and/or components;•a decline in infrastructure spending by foreign governments, including China;•a decline in the U.S. government defense budget, changes in spending or budgetary priorities, a prolonged U.S. government shutdown or delays in contract awards;•any significant decline in our backlog;•our ability to recruit, hire, retain and motivate adequate numbers of engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of our customers;10•our ability to generate new design opportunities and win competitive bid selection processes;•the increasing costs of providing employee benefits worldwide, including health insurance, retirement plan and pension plan contributions and retirement benefits; •our ability to utilize our manufacturing facilities at efficient levels;•potential significant litigation-related costs or product warranty and/or indemnity claims, including those not covered by our suppliers or insurers;•the difficulties inherent in forecasting future operating expense levels, including with respect to costs associated with labor, utilities, transportation and raw materials;•the costs related to compliance with increasing worldwide government, environmental and social responsibility regulations; •new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting standards and practices; and•the effects of public health emergencies, natural disasters, widespread travel disruptions, security risks, terrorist activities, international conflicts and other events beyond our control.In addition, the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic upturns and downturns. Our business and certain of the end markets we serve are also subject to rapid technological changes and material fluctuations in demand based on end-user preferences.  There can be no assurance (i) that products stocked in our inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them, or (ii) that we will be able to design, develop and produce products in a timely fashion to accommodate changing customer demand. As a result of these and other factors, we may experience material fluctuations in future revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share on a quarterly or annual basis.  Our historical financial performance and results of operations should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance or results.  In addition, if our revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share results or expectations do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the market price of our common stock may decline.Our acquisition of Linear Technology Corporation (Linear) and the integration of its business, operations and employees with our own may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected, and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the acquisition may not be fully realized, which could adversely impact our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.          We completed the acquisition of Linear, which we refer to as the Acquisition, on March 10, 2017.  The success of the Acquisition, including the achievement of anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Acquisition, is subject to a number of uncertainties and will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine and integrate Linear's business into our business in an efficient and effective manner. Potential difficulties the combined company may encounter in the integration process include the following: •the inability to successfully integrate Linear's business into our own in a manner that permits the combined company to achieve the cost savings and operating synergies anticipated to result from the Acquisition, which could result in the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition not being realized partly or wholly in the time frame currently anticipated or at all;•integrating personnel, IT systems and corporate, finance and administrative infrastructures of the two companies while maintaining focus on providing consistent, high quality products and services;•coordinating and integrating our internal operations, compensation and benefits programs, policies and procedures, and corporate structures; and•servicing the substantial debt that we have incurred in connection with the Acquisition.Any of these factors could result in the combined company failing to realize the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition, on the expected timeline or at all, and could adversely impact our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.Increases in our effective tax rate and exposure to additional tax liabilities may adversely impact our results of operations.Our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned.  Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was below our blended U.S. federal statutory rate of 23.4% calculated under the provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Legislation) enacted on December 22, 2017. It was also below the U.S. statutory tax rate of 35% for fiscal 2017 under the previous tax laws.  This is primarily due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income. A number of factors may increase our future 11effective tax rate, including: new or revised tax laws or legislation or the interpretation of such laws or legislation by governmental authorities; increases in tax rates in various jurisdictions; variation in the mix of jurisdictions in which our profits are earned and taxed; deferred taxes arising from basis differences in investments in foreign subsidiaries; any adverse resolution of ongoing tax audits or adverse rulings from taxing authorities worldwide, including our current transfer pricing appeal in Ireland; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including executive compensation subject to the limitations of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code and amortization of assets acquired in connection with strategic transactions; decreased availability of tax deductions for stock-based compensation awards worldwide; and changes in available tax credits. In addition, we have a partial tax holiday through July 2025 in Malaysia. The ability to extend such tax holiday beyond its expiration date cannot be assured. In addition, if we fail to meet certain conditions of the tax holiday, we may lose the benefit of the tax holiday and/or be subject to additional taxes and/or penalties. Any significant increase in our future effective tax rate could adversely impact our net income during future periods.             In addition, any changes in tax legislation and further interpretation of certain aspects of the U.S. Tax Legislation, which become effective in the fiscal year ending November 2, 2019, may result in changes to long-standing tax principles, which could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities.  On October 5, 2015, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, an international association of thirty-five countries, including the United States, Ireland and UK, released the final reports from its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action Plans. The BEPS recommendations covered a number of issues, including country-by-country reporting, permanent establishment rules, transfer pricing rules and tax treaties.  We continue to monitor these developments.  Additionally, as a result of the Tax Legislation described above, we recorded provisional estimates of the one-time adjustments for the re-measurement of deferred tax assets (liabilities) and the deemed repatriation tax on unremitted foreign earnings and profits.  The final impact of the new Tax Legislation may differ from these estimates, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations and assumptions made, additional guidance that may be issued, unexpected negative changes in business and market conditions that could reduce certain tax benefits, and actions we take as a result of this new tax law.We may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary intellectual property rights, which may limit our ability to compete effectively.Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We primarily rely on patent, mask work, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietary technologies and processes. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain, copy, reverse engineer, use or disclose our technologies, products and processes. Moreover, the laws of foreign countries in which we design, manufacture, market and sell our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary intellectual property. There can be no assurance that the claims allowed in our issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. In addition, any of our existing or future patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. As such, any rights granted under these patents may not provide us with adequate protection. We may not be able to obtain foreign patents or pending applications corresponding to our U.S. patents and applications. Even if patents are granted, enforcement may not be available or achieved under the circumstances. If our patents and mask works do not adequately protect our technology, our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours. Our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents.We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and strategic partners. We also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies, documentation and other proprietary information. Despite these efforts, internal or external parties may attempt to copy, disclose, obtain or use our products or technology without our authorization. Also, former employees may seek employment with our business partners, customers or competitors, and there can be no assurance that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment.A significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems or certain of our products could materially and adversely affect our business or reputation.  We rely on information technology systems throughout our company to keep financial records and customer data, process orders, manage inventory, coordinate shipments to customers, maintain confidential and proprietary information, assist in semiconductor engineering and other technical activities and operate other critical functions such as Internet connectivity, network communications and email.  Our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, employee malfeasance, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events.   We also rely upon external cloud providers for certain infrastructure activities. If we were to experience a prolonged disruption in the information technology systems that involve our internal communications or our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, 12which could adversely affect our business. We may also be subject to security breaches of our information technology systems and certain of our products caused by viruses, illegal break-ins or hacking, sabotage, or acts of vandalism by third parties or our employees or contractors.  Our security measures or those of our third party service providers may not detect or prevent security breaches, defects, bugs or errors.  In addition, we provide our confidential and proprietary information to our strategic partners in certain cases where doing so is necessary to conduct our business.  While we employ confidentiality agreements to protect such information, nonetheless those third parties may also be subject to security breaches or otherwise compromise the protection of such information.  Security breaches of our information technology systems or those of our partners could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential and proprietary information belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage.Long-term contracts are not typical for us, and incorrect forecasts or reductions, cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results.We typically do not have long-term sales contracts with our customers. In certain markets where end-user demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict, some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment, even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all, or even any, of the product. In other instances, we manufacture product based on forecasts of customer demands, which may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis. Additionally, our U.S. government contracts and subcontracts may be funded in increments over a number of government budget periods and typically can be terminated by the government for its convenience.  As a result, we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales, and we are subject to the risk of lower than expected orders or cancellations of orders, leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog. Further, orders or forecasts for products that meet the customer’s unique requirements and that are canceled or unrealized orders would, in addition, result in an inventory of unsaleable products, causing potential inventory write-offs, and we may be unable to recover all of our costs incurred or committed. As a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the products that are subject to these uncertainties, the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial. Incorrect forecasts, or reductions, cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results.Our future success depends upon our ability to execute our business strategy, continue to innovate, improve our existing products, design, develop, produce and market new products, and identify and enter new markets.Our future success significantly depends on our continued ability to execute our business strategy, continue to improve our existing products and design, develop, produce and market innovative new products and system-level solutions. Product design, development, innovation and enhancement is often a complex, time-consuming and costly process involving significant investment in research and development, with no assurance of return on investment. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new and improved products in a timely or efficient manner or that new and improved products, if developed, will achieve market acceptance. Our products generally must conform to various evolving and sometimes competing industry standards, which may adversely affect our ability to compete in certain markets or require us to incur significant costs. In addition, our customers generally impose very high quality and reliability standards on our products, which often change and may be difficult or costly to satisfy. Any inability to satisfy customer quality and reliability standards or comply with industry standards and technical requirements may adversely affect demand for our products and our results of operations. In addition, our growth is dependent on our ability to generate new design opportunities and win competitive bid selection processes.  Failure to obtain or maintain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining or maintaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product and could also weaken our position in future competitive selection processes.  Our growth is also dependent on our ability to identify and penetrate new markets where we have limited experience and competition is intense. Some of our customers in new markets are less established, which could subject us to increased credit risk. There can be no assurance that the markets we serve and/or target based on our business strategy will grow in the future, that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets, that our products, or the products in which our products are used, will achieve customer acceptance in these markets, that competitors will not force price reductions or take market share from us, or that we can achieve or maintain adequate gross margins or profits in these markets. Additionally, developing markets, such as the Industry 4.0, autonomous driving, artificial intelligence and 5G, require significant investments, resources and technological advancements in order to compete effectively and there can be no assurance that we will achieve success in these markets.  Furthermore, a decline in demand in one or several of our end-user markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations.We may not be able to compete successfully in markets within the semiconductor industry in the future.We face intense competition in the semiconductor industry, and we expect this competition to increase in the future, including from companies located outside of the United States. Competition is generally based on innovation, design, quality and reliability of products, product performance, features and functionality, product pricing, availability and capacity, technological service and support, and the availability of integrated system solutions, with the relative importance of these factors varying among products, markets and customers. Many companies have sufficient financial, manufacturing, technical, sales and marketing resources to develop and market products that compete with our products. Some of our competitors may 13have more advantageous supply or development relationships with our current and potential customers or suppliers. Our competitors also include emerging companies selling specialized products in markets we serve and entities outside of the U.S., including entities associated with well-funded efforts by foreign governments to create indigenous semiconductor industries.  Existing or new competitors may develop products or technologies that more effectively address the demands of our customers and markets with enhanced performance, features and functionality, lower power requirements, greater levels of integration or lower cost. In addition, as we seek to expand our business, including the design and production of products and services for developing and emerging markets, we may encounter increased competition from our current competitors and/or new competitors.  Increased competition in certain markets has resulted in and may continue to result in declining average selling prices, reduced gross margins and loss of market share in those markets. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors, or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased competition.  In addition, the semiconductor industry has experienced significant consolidation over the past several years.  Consolidation among our competitors could lead to a changing competitive landscape, which could negatively impact our competitive position and market share and harm our results of operations.We rely on third-party suppliers, subcontractors and manufacturers for some industry-standard wafers, manufacturing processes, assembly and test services, and transportation, and we generally cannot control their availability or conditions of supply.We rely, and plan to continue to rely, on third-party suppliers, assembly and test subcontractors, freight carriers and wafer fabricators (collectively, suppliers) to supply most of our products that can be manufactured using industry-standard processes. This reliance involves several risks, including reduced control over availability, capacity utilization, delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, and costs. We currently source approximately half of our wafer requirements annually from third-party wafer fabrication foundries, primarily Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. In addition, these suppliers often provide manufacturing services to our competitors and therefore periods of increased industry demand may result in capacity constraints. In certain instances, the third-party supplier is the sole source of highly specialized processing services. If our suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver components to us on the time schedule and of the quality or quantity that we require or provide us with required manufacturing processes, we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers, which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers. If additional or replacement suppliers or manufacturing processes are not available, we may also experience delays in product development or shipment which could, in turn, result in the temporary or permanent loss of customers.A prolonged disruption of our internal manufacturing operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.In addition to leveraging an outsourcing model for manufacturing operations, we also rely on our internal manufacturing operations located in the United States, Ireland, the Philippines, Singapore and Malaysia. A prolonged disruption at, or inability to utilize, one or more of our manufacturing facilities, loss of raw materials or damage to our manufacturing equipment for any reason, including due to natural or man-made disasters, civil unrest or other events outside of our control, such as widespread outbreaks of illness or the failure to maintain our labor force at one or more of these facilities, may disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in us being unable to timely satisfy customer demand. As a result, we could forgo revenue opportunities, potentially lose market share and damage our customer relationships, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow, we may not be able to service our debt obligations, including making payments on our outstanding term loans and senior unsecured notes.Our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness when due, including the significant indebtedness that we have incurred in connection with the Acquisition, depends upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our outstanding debt, we may be required to, among other things:•seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets;•refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness;•borrow under our revolving credit facility;•divert funds that would otherwise be invested in our operations;•repatriate earnings as dividends from foreign locations, attracting foreign withholding and state and local income taxes;•sell selected assets; or14•reduce or delay planned capital expenditures or operating expenditures.Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt, which could negatively impact our financial results. In addition, we may not be able to obtain any such financing, refinancing or complete a sale of assets on economically favorable terms. In the case of financing or refinancing, favorable interest rates will depend on the health of the debt capital markets.Our significant existing indebtedness could also have the effect, among other things, of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions, reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes or creating competitive disadvantages relative to other companies with lower debt levels.The markets for semiconductor products are cyclical, and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices, and conversely, we may not be able to satisfy unexpected demand for our products.The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly.  The demand for our products is subject to the strength of our four major end markets of Industrial, Communications, Automotive and Consumer.  If we expand our operations and workforce too rapidly or procure excessive resources in anticipation of increased demand for our products, and that demand does not materialize at the pace at which we expect, or declines, or if we overbuild inventory in a period of decreased demand, our operating results may be adversely affected as a result of increased operating expenses, reduced margins, underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges. These capacity expansions by us and other semiconductor manufacturers could also lead to overcapacity in our target markets which could lead to price erosion that would adversely impact our operating results. Conversely, during periods of rapid increases in demand, our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy the demand. In addition, we may not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner, procure adequate resources and raw materials, locate suitable third-party suppliers, or respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to demand for new products requested by our customers, and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected.Our semiconductor products are complex and we may be subject to product warranty and indemnity claims, which could result in significant costs and damage to our reputation and adversely affect customer relationships, the market acceptance of our products and our operating results.Semiconductor products are highly complex and may contain defects when they are first introduced or as new versions are developed. Failures in our products and services or in the products of customers could result in damage to our reputation for reliability and increase our legal or financial exposure to third parties.  Certain of our products and services could also contain security vulnerabilities, defects, bugs and errors, which could also result in significant data losses, security breaches and theft of intellectual property.  We generally warrant our products to our customers for one year from the date title passes from us. We invest significant resources in the testing of our products; however, if any of our products contain defects, we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders. These problems may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or others, including liability for costs and expenses associated with product recalls, which may adversely impact our operating results. We may also be subject to customer indemnity claims. Our customers have on occasion been sued, and may be sued in the future, by third parties alleging infringement of intellectual property rights, or damages resulting from use of our products. Those customers may seek indemnification from us under the terms and conditions of our sales contracts with them. In certain cases, our potential indemnification liability may be significant. If any of our products contain defects, or have reliability, quality or compatibility problems, our reputation may be damaged, which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to customers and could also adversely affect our operating results.The fabrication of integrated circuits is highly complex and precise, and our manufacturing processes utilize a substantial amount of technology. Minute impurities, contaminants in the manufacturing environment, difficulties in the fabrication process, defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process, manufacturing equipment failures, wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional. While we have significant expertise in semiconductor manufacturing, it is possible that some processes could become unstable. This instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.We are occasionally involved in litigation, including claims regarding intellectual property rights, which could be costly to litigate and could require us to redesign products or pay significant royalties.The semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights. Other companies or individuals have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes, and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling infringing products, if those patents are found to be valid and infringed by us.  In the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we could 15be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property, and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement, and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel. We could also be subject to litigation or arbitration disputes arising under our contractual obligations, as well as customer indemnity, warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant costs and expenses as we defend those claims or pay damage awards. There can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities, and we may elect to self-insure with respect to certain matters. An adverse outcome in litigation or arbitration could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or on our operating results or cash flows in the period in which the dispute is resolved.If we are unable to recruit or retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our business strategy will be adversely affected.Our continued success depends to a significant extent upon the recruitment, retention and effective succession of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel, particularly our experienced engineers. The competition for these employees is intense. The loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. The inability to attract, hire and retain key employees with critical technical skills to achieve our strategy, including as a result of changes to immigration policies, could also have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, there could be a material adverse effect on our business should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel. We do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or employees.To remain competitive, we may need to invest in or acquire other companies, purchase or license technology from third parties, or enter into other strategic transactions in order to introduce new products or enhance our existing products.An element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisitions of businesses, assets, products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings, diversify our product portfolio, expand our market coverage, increase our engineering workforce, expand our technical skill sets or enhance our technological capabilities. We may not be able to find businesses that have the technology or resources we need and, if we find such businesses, we may not be able to invest in, purchase or license the technology or resources on commercially favorable terms or at all. Acquisitions, investments and technology licenses are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons, including the cost of potential transactions, competition among prospective buyers and licensees, the need for regulatory approvals, and difficulties related to integration efforts.  In addition, investments in private companies are subject to a risk of a partial or total loss of our investment.  Both in the U.S. and abroad, governmental regulation of acquisitions, including antitrust reviews and approvals, has become more complex, increasing the costs and risks of undertaking and consummating significant acquisitions. In order to finance a potential transaction, we may need to raise additional funds by issuing securities or borrowing money. We may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms, and the sale of our stock may result in the dilution of our existing shareholders or the issuance of securities with rights that are superior to the rights of our common shareholders.Acquisitions also involve a number of challenges and risks, including:•difficulty or delay integrating acquired technologies, operations and personnel with our existing businesses;•diversion of management's attention in connection with both negotiating the transaction and integrating the assets;•strain on managerial and operational resources as management tries to oversee larger or more complex operations;•the future funding requirements for acquired companies, which may be significant;•potential loss of key employees;•exposure to unforeseen liabilities or regulatory compliance issues of acquired companies; •higher than expected or unexpected costs relating to or associated with an acquisition and integration of assets;•difficulty realizing synergies and growth prospects of an acquisition in a timely manner or at all; and•increased risk of costly and time-consuming legal proceedings.If we are unable to successfully address these risks, we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of the acquisition, which may have an adverse effect on our business strategy, plans and operating results.We rely on supplies, services and manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable areas, which could affect our ability to produce products.We, like many companies in the semiconductor industry, rely on supplies, services, internal manufacturing capacity, wafer fabrication foundries and other subcontractors in geologically unstable locations around the world. Earthquakes, tsunamis, flooding or other natural disasters may disrupt local semiconductor-related businesses and adversely affect 16manufacturing capacity, availability and cost of key raw materials, utilities and equipment, and availability of key services, including transport of our products worldwide.  Our insurance may not adequately cover losses resulting from such disruptions.  Any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities, or those of our subcontractors or third-party wafer fabrication foundries, as a result of fire, flood, natural disaster, unavailability of utilities or otherwise, could result in a temporary or permanent loss of customers for affected products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.We are exposed to business, economic, political, legal, regulatory and other risks through our significant worldwide operations, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We have significant operations and manufacturing facilities outside the United States, including in Ireland, the Philippines, Singapore and Malaysia. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from customers in international markets, and we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the future.  Risks associated with our international business operations include the following:  •political, legal and economic changes, crises or instability and civil unrest in foreign markets;•currency conversion risks and exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations;•trade policy, trade, travel, export or taxation disputes or restrictions, government sanctions, import or export tariffs or other restrictions imposed by the U.S. government or by the governments of the countries in which we do business, particularly in China; •complex, varying and changing government regulations and legal standards and requirements, particularly with respect to price protection, competition practices, export control regulations and restrictions, customs and tax requirements, immigration, anti-boycott regulations, data privacy, intellectual property, anti-corruption and environmental compliance, including U.S. customs and export regulations and restrictions, International Traffic in Arms Regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;•economic disruption from terrorism and threats of terrorism and the response to them by the U.S. and its allies;•increased managerial complexities, including different employment practices and labor issues;•changes in immigration laws, regulations and procedures and enforcement practices of various government agencies;•greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting such rights;•natural disasters or pandemics;•transportation disruptions and delays and increases in labor and transportation costs;•changes to foreign taxes, tariffs and freight rates;•fluctuations in raw material costs and energy costs;•greater difficulty in accounts receivable collections and longer collection periods; and•costs associated with our foreign defined benefit pension plans.Any of these risks, or any other risks related to international business operations, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Many of these risks are present in China.  While we expect to continue to expand our business and operations in China, our success in the Chinese markets may be adversely affected by China’s continuously evolving policies, laws and regulations, including those relating to trade, taxation, import and export tariffs or restrictions, currency controls, antitrust, cybersecurity and data protection, the environment, indigenous innovation and the promotion of a domestic semiconductor industry, and intellectual property rights and enforcement and protection of those rights. Enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be inconsistent. In addition, changes in the political environment, governmental policies, international trade policies and relations, or U.S.-China relations could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, exposure of our proprietary intellectual property, increased taxation, trade sanctions, the imposition of import duties or tariffs, restrictions on imports or exports, currency revaluations, or retaliatory actions by China in response to U.S. actions, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results. At November 3, 2018, our principal source of liquidity was $816.6 million of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, of which approximately $383.5 million was held in the United States and the remaining balance was held outside the United States in various foreign subsidiaries.  We continue to assert our intent to reinvest substantially all of our foreign earnings indefinitely, however we are in the process of analyzing the impact that the Tax Legislation has on this indefinite 17reinvestment assertion. As we intend to reinvest substantially all of our foreign earnings indefinitely, certain cash held outside the United States may not be available for repatriation as dividends to the United States in the future. We require a substantial amount of cash in the United States for operating requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends and acquisitions. If we are unable to address our U.S. cash requirements through operations, borrowings under our current revolving credit facility, future debt or equity offerings or other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost, it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of earnings that are indefinitely reinvested, and we may be required to pay additional taxes under current tax laws, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Our operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors.A significant portion of our sales are through independent distributors that are not under our control. These independent distributors generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts applied to our products or they could terminate their representation of us. We generally do not require letters of credit from our distributors and are not protected against accounts receivable default or declarations of bankruptcy by these distributors. Our inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our operating results. Termination of a significant distributor or a group of distributors, whether at our initiative or the distributor’s initiative or through consolidation in the distribution industry, could disrupt our current business, and if we are unable to find suitable replacements, our operating results could be adversely affected.  We have also recently reduced the number of distributors we use, which may exacerbate the foregoing risks.Effective November 4, 2018, all distributor sales will be recognized upon shipment to the distributor under Accounting Standards Update 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASU 2014-09). Upon adoption of ASU 2014-09, we will no longer be permitted to defer revenue until sale by the distributor to the end customer, but rather, will be required to estimate the effects of returns and allowances provided to distributors and record revenue at the time of sale to the distributor.   If our estimates of such credits and rights are materially understated it could cause subsequent adjustments that negatively impact our revenues and gross profits in a future period.We are subject to environmental, health and safety (EHS) regulations, which could increase our expenses and affect our operating results.Our industry is subject to EHS requirements, particularly those environmental requirements that control and restrict the sourcing, use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage and disposal of certain chemicals, and materials used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process. Public attention to environmental, sustainability and social responsibility concerns continues to increase, and our customers routinely include stringent environmental and other standards in their contracts with us. Changes in EHS laws or regulations may require us to invest in costly equipment or make manufacturing process changes and may adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products. In addition, we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability for damages caused by potential or actual releases of such materials. Any failure to control such materials adequately or to comply with existing or future EHS statutory or regulatory standards, requirements or contractual obligations could result in any of the following, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results:•liability for damages and remediation; •the imposition of regulatory penalties and civil and criminal fines; •the suspension or termination of the development, manufacture, sale or use of certain of our products; •changes to our manufacturing processes or a need to substitute materials that may cost more or be less available;•damage to our reputation; and/or increased expenses associated with compliance.If we fail to comply with government contracting regulations, we could suffer a loss of revenue or incur price adjustments or other penalties.Some of our revenue is derived from contracts with agencies of the United States government and subcontracts with its prime contractors. As a United States government contractor or subcontractor, we are subject to federal contracting regulations, including the Federal Acquisition Regulations, which govern the allowability of costs incurred by us in the performance of United States government contracts. Certain contract pricing is based on estimated direct and indirect costs, which are subject to change. Additionally, the United States government is entitled after final payment on certain negotiated contracts to examine all of our cost records with respect to such contracts and to seek a downward adjustment to the price of the contract if it determines that we failed to furnish complete, accurate and current cost or pricing data in connection with the negotiation of the price of the contract.In connection with our United States government business, we are also subject to government audits and to review and approval of our policies, procedures, and internal controls for compliance with procurement regulations and applicable laws. In 18certain circumstances, if we do not comply with the terms of a contract or with regulations or statutes, we could be subject to downward contract price adjustments or refund obligations or could in extreme circumstances be assessed civil and criminal penalties or be debarred or suspended from obtaining future contracts for a specified period of time. Any such suspension or debarment or other sanction could have an adverse effect on our business.Under some of our government subcontracts, we are required to maintain secure facilities and to obtain security clearances for personnel involved in performance of the contract, in compliance with applicable federal standards. If we were unable to comply with these requirements, or if personnel critical to our performance of these contracts were unable to obtain or maintain their security clearances, we might be unable to perform these contracts or compete for other projects of this nature, which could adversely affect our revenue.Restrictions in our revolving credit facility, term loans and outstanding debt instruments may limit our activities.Our current revolving credit facility, term loans and outstanding debt instruments impose, and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may impose, restrictions that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our Company, including to undertake certain transactions, to create certain liens on our assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness. Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and changes in technology, government regulations and the level of competition. In addition, our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. If we breach any of the covenants under our revolving credit facility, the indentures governing our outstanding senior unsecured notes, the term loans or any future debt instruments to which we may become subject and do not obtain appropriate waivers, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness thereunder could be declared immediately due and payable or we may be restricted from further borrowing under our revolving credit facility.Our stock price may be volatile.The market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future, as it may be significantly affected by factors including:•global economic conditions generally;•crises in global credit, debt and financial markets;•actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and operating results;•changes in financial estimates or other statements made by securities analysts or others in analyst reports or other publications or our failure to perform in line with those estimates or statements or our published guidance;•financial results and prospects of our customers;•U.S. and foreign government actions, including with respect to trade, travel, export and taxation;•changes in market valuations of other semiconductor companies;•rumors and speculation in the press, investment community or on social media about us, our customers or other companies in our industry;•announcements by us, our customers or our competitors of significant new products, technical innovations, material transactions, acquisitions or dispositions, litigation, capital commitments or revised earnings estimates;•departures of key personnel;•alleged noncompliance with laws, regulations or ethics standards by us or any of our employees, officers or directors; and•negative media publicity targeting us or our suppliers, customers or competitors.The stock market has historically experienced volatility, especially within the semiconductor industry, that often has been unrelated to the performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless of our operating results.Our directors and executive officers periodically sell shares of our common stock in the market, including pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans.  Regardless of the individual's reasons for such sales, securities analysts and investors could view such sales as a negative indicator and our stock price could be adversely affected as a result.19"
0,ADI,ANALOG DEVICES,2017-11-22,"ITEM 1A.     RISK FACTORSSet forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the SEC are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report.Our acquisition of Linear Technology Corporation (Linear) and the integration of its business, operations and employees with our own may be more difficult, costly or time consuming than expected, and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the acquisition may not be fully realized, which could adversely impact our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.          We completed the acquisition of Linear, which we refer to as the Acquisition, on March 10, 2017.  The success of the Acquisition, including the achievement of anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Acquisition, is subject to a number of uncertainties and will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine and integrate Linear's business into our business in an efficient and effective manner. Potential difficulties the combined company may encounter in the integration process include the following: •the inability to successfully integrate Linear's business into our own in a manner that permits the combined company to achieve the cost savings and operating synergies anticipated to result from the Acquisition, which could result in the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition not being realized partly or wholly in the time frame currently anticipated or at all;•lost sales and customers as a result of certain customers of either or both of the two companies deciding not to do business with the combined company, or deciding to decrease their amount of business in order to reduce their reliance on a single company; •loss of key management and technical personnel, particularly our experienced engineers;•integrating personnel, IT systems and corporate, finance and administrative infrastructures of the two companies while maintaining focus on providing consistent, high quality products and services;•coordinating and integrating our internal operations, compensation programs, policies and procedures, and corporate structures;•potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen or increased costs and expenses;•the possibility of faulty assumptions underlying expectations regarding potential synergies and the integration process;•incurring significant Acquisition-related costs and expenses associated with combining our operations; •performance shortfalls at one or both of the two companies as a result of the diversion of management’s attention caused by integrating the companies’ operations; and•servicing the substantial debt that we have incurred in connection with the Acquisition.Any of these factors could result in the combined company failing to realize the anticipated benefits of the Acquisition, on the expected timeline or at all, and could adversely impact our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.Disruptions in global credit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.Continuing uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets may lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending, which may cause our customers to cancel, decrease or delay their existing and future orders for our products and make it difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities.  Significant disruption to global credit and financial markets may also adversely affect our ability to access external financing sources on acceptable terms.  Financial difficulties experienced by our customers could result in nonpayment or payment delays for previously purchased products, thereby increasing our credit risk exposure.  Uncertainty regarding the future stability of the global credit and financial markets could cause the value of the currency in the affected markets to deteriorate, thus reducing the purchasing power of those customers. In addition, financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or distributors could result in product delays, increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges. If economic conditions deteriorate, we may record additional charges relating to restructuring costs or the impairment of assets and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.Our future revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate.Our future revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors, including:•the effects of adverse economic conditions in the markets in which we sell our products;•changes in customer demand for our products and/or for end products that incorporate our products;•the timing, delay, reduction or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability to manage inventory;11•fluctuations in customer order patterns and seasonality;•our ability to effectively manage our cost structure in both the short term and over a longer duration;•changes in geographic, product or customer mix;•changes in our effective tax rates or new or revised tax legislation in the United States, Ireland or worldwide; •the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us, our customers or our competitors and the market acceptance of such products;•pricing decisions and competitive pricing pressures;•fluctuations in manufacturing yields, adequate availability of wafers and other raw materials, and manufacturing, assembly and test capacity;•the ability of our third-party suppliers, subcontractors and manufacturers to supply us with sufficient quantities of raw materials, products and/or components;•a decline in infrastructure spending by foreign governments, including China;•a decline in the U.S. Government defense budget, changes in spending or budgetary priorities, a prolonged U.S. Government shutdown or delays in contract awards;•any significant decline in our backlog;•our ability to recruit, hire, retain and motivate adequate numbers of engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of our customers;•our ability to generate new design opportunities and win competitive bid selection processes;•the increasing costs of providing employee benefits, including health insurance, retirement plan and pension plan contributions and retirement benefits; •our ability to utilize our manufacturing facilities at efficient levels;•potential significant litigation-related costs or product warranty and/or indemnity claims, including those not covered by our suppliers or insurers;•the difficulties inherent in forecasting future operating expense levels, including with respect to costs associated with labor, utilities, transportation and raw materials;•the costs related to compliance with increasing worldwide government, environmental and social responsibility regulations; •new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting standards and practices; and•the effects of public health emergencies, natural disasters, widespread travel disruptions, security risks, terrorist activities, international conflicts, government sanctions, changes in law, including executive orders, changes in import and export regulations and other events beyond our control.In addition, the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic upturns and downturns. Our business and certain of the end markets we serve are also subject to rapid technological changes and material fluctuations in demand based on end-user preferences.  There can be no assurance (i) that products stocked in our inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them, or (ii) that we will be able to design, develop and produce products in a timely fashion to accommodate changing customer demand. As a result of these and other factors, we may experience material fluctuations in future revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share on a quarterly or annual basis.  Our historical financial performance and results of operations should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance or results.  In addition, if our revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share results or expectations do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the market price of our common stock may decline.Increases in our effective tax rate and exposure to additional tax liabilities may adversely impact our results of operations.Our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned.  Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was below the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35%, primarily due to 12lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income.  A number of factors may increase our future effective tax rate, including: new or revised tax laws or legislation or the interpretation of such laws or legislation by governmental authorities; increases in tax rates in various jurisdictions; variation in the mix of jurisdictions in which our profits are earned and taxed; repatriation of non-U.S. earnings; any adverse resolution of ongoing tax audits or adverse rulings from taxing authorities worldwide; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including executive compensation subject to the limitations of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code and amortization of assets acquired in connection with strategic transactions; decreased availability of tax deductions for stock-based compensation awards worldwide; and changes in available tax credits. In addition, we have a partial tax holiday through July 2025 in Malaysia and a partial tax holiday in Singapore through August 2019. The ability to extend such tax holidays beyond their date of expiration cannot be assured; if we fail to meet certain conditions to the tax holidays, we may lose the benefit of the tax holdings and/or be subject to additional taxes and/or penalties. Any significant increase in our future effective tax rate could adversely impact our net income during future periods.  On October 5, 2015, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), an international association of thirty-five countries, including the United States, Ireland and UK, released the final reports from its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action Plans. The BEPS recommendations covered a number of issues, including country-by-country reporting, permanent establishment rules, transfer pricing rules and tax treaties. Future tax reform resulting from such recommendations may result in changes to long-standing tax principles, which could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities.Long-term contracts are not typical for us, and incorrect forecasts or reductions, cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results.We typically do not have long-term sales contracts with our customers. In certain markets where end-user demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict, some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment, even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all, or even any, of the product. In other instances, we manufacture product based on forecasts of customer demands, which may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis. Additionally, our U.S. government contracts and subcontracts may be funded in increments over a number of government budget periods and typically can be terminated by the government for its convenience.  As a result, we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales, and we are subject to the risk of lower than expected orders or cancellations of orders, leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog. Further, orders or forecasts for products that meet the customer’s unique requirements and that are canceled or unrealized orders would, in addition, result in an inventory of unsaleable products, causing potential inventory write-offs, and we may be unable to recover all of our costs incurred or committed. As a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the products that are subject to these uncertainties, the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial. Incorrect forecasts, or reductions, cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results.Our future success depends upon our ability to execute our business strategy, continue to innovate, improve our existing products, design, develop, produce and market new products, and identify and enter new markets.Our future success significantly depends on our continued ability to execute our business strategy, continue to improve our existing products and design, develop, produce and market innovative new products. Product design, development, innovation and enhancement is often a complex, time-consuming and costly process involving significant investment in research and development, with no assurance of return on investment. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new and improved products in a timely or efficient manner or that new and improved products, if developed, will achieve market acceptance. Our products generally must conform to various evolving and sometimes competing industry standards, which may adversely affect our ability to compete in certain markets or require us to incur significant costs. In addition, our customers generally impose very high quality and reliability standards on our products, which often change and may be difficult or costly to satisfy. Any inability to satisfy customer quality and reliability standards or comply with industry standards and technical requirements may adversely affect demand for our products and our results of operations. In addition, our growth is dependent on our ability to generate new design opportunities and win competitive bid selection processes.  Failure to obtain or maintain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining or maintaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product and could also weaken our position in future competitive selection processes.  Our growth is also dependent on our ability to identify and penetrate new markets where we have limited experience and competition is intense. Some of our customers in new markets are less established, which could subject us to increased credit risk. There can be no assurance that the markets we serve and/or target based on our business strategy will grow in the future, that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets, that our products, or the products in which our products are used, will achieve customer acceptance in these markets, that competitors will not force price reductions or take market share from us, or that we can achieve or maintain adequate gross margins or profits in these markets. Additionally, developing markets, such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and autonomous driving, require significant investments, resources and technological advancements in order to compete effectively and there can be no assurance that we 13will achieve success in these markets.  Furthermore, a decline in demand in one or several of our end-user markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations.We may not be able to compete successfully in markets within the semiconductor industry in the future.We face intense competition in the semiconductor industry, and we expect this competition to increase in the future, including from companies located outside of the United States. Competition is generally based on innovation, design, quality and reliability of products, product performance, features and functionality, product pricing, availability and capacity, technological service and support, and the availability of integrated system solutions, with the relative importance of these factors varying among products, markets and customers. Many companies have sufficient financial, manufacturing, technical, sales and marketing resources to develop and market products that compete with our products. Some of our competitors may have more advantageous supply or development relationships with our current and potential customers or suppliers. Our competitors also include emerging companies selling specialized products in markets we serve and entities outside of the U.S., including entities associated with efforts by foreign governments to create indigenous semiconductor industries.  Existing or new competitors may develop products or technologies that more effectively address the demands of our customers and markets with enhanced performance, features and functionality, lower power requirements, greater levels of integration or lower cost. In addition, as we seek to expand our business, including the design and production of products and services for the IoT market, we may encounter increased competition from our current competitors and/or new competitors.  Increased competition in certain markets has resulted in and may continue to result in declining average selling prices, reduced gross margins and loss of market share in those markets. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors, or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased competition.  In addition, the semiconductor industry has experienced significant consolidation over the past several years.  Consolidation among our competitors could lead to a changing competitive landscape, which could negatively impact our competitive position and market share and harm our results of operations.We rely on third-party suppliers, subcontractors and manufacturers for some industry-standard wafers, manufacturing processes, assembly and test services, and transportation, and we generally cannot control their availability or conditions of supply.We rely, and plan to continue to rely, on third-party suppliers, assembly and test subcontractors, freight carriers and wafer fabricators (collectively, suppliers) to supply most of our products that can be manufactured using industry-standard processes. This reliance involves several risks, including reduced control over availability, capacity utilization, delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, and costs. We currently source approximately 45% of our wafer requirements annually from third-party wafer fabrication foundries, primarily Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. In addition, these suppliers often provide manufacturing services to our competitors and therefore periods of increased industry demand may result in capacity constraints. In certain instances, the third-party supplier is the sole source of highly specialized processing services. If our suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver components to us on the time schedule and of the quality or quantity that we require or provide us with required manufacturing processes, we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers, which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers. If additional or replacement suppliers or manufacturing processes are not available, we may also experience delays in product development or shipment which could, in turn, result in the temporary or permanent loss of customers.A prolonged disruption of our internal manufacturing operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.In addition to leveraging an outsourcing model for manufacturing operations, we also rely on our internal manufacturing operations located in the United States, Ireland, the Philippines, Singapore and Malaysia. A prolonged disruption at, or inability to utilize, one or more of our manufacturing facilities, loss of raw materials or damage to our manufacturing equipment for any reason, including due to natural or man-made disasters or other events outside of our control, such as widespread outbreaks of illness or the failure to maintain our labor force at one or more of these facilities, may disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenue and result in us being unable to timely satisfy customer demand. As a result, we could forgo revenue opportunities, potentially lose market share and damage our customer relationships, all of which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow, we may not be able to service our debt obligations, including making payments on our outstanding term loans and senior unsecured notes.Our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness when due, including the significant indebtedness that we have incurred in connection with the Acquisition, depends upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our outstanding debt, we may be required to, among other things:•seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets;14•refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness;•borrow under our revolving credit facility;•divert funds that would otherwise be invested in our operations;•repatriate earnings at higher tax rates that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign locations;•sell selected assets; or•reduce or delay planned capital expenditures or operating expenditures.Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt, which could negatively impact our financial results. In addition, we may not be able to obtain any such financing, refinancing or complete a sale of assets on economically favorable terms. In the case of financing or refinancing, favorable interest rates will be dependent on the health of the debt capital markets.Our significant existing indebtedness could also have the effect, among other things, of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions, reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes or creating competitive disadvantages relative to other companies with lower debt levels.The markets for semiconductor products are cyclical, and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices, and conversely, we may not be able to satisfy unexpected demand for our products.The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly.  The demand for our products is subject to the strength of our four major end markets of Industrial, Communications, Automotive and Consumer.  If we expand our operations and workforce too rapidly or procure excessive resources in anticipation of increased demand for our products, and that demand does not materialize at the pace at which we expect, or declines, or if we overbuild inventory in a period of decreased demand, our operating results may be adversely affected as a result of increased operating expenses, reduced margins, underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges. These capacity expansions by us and other semiconductor manufacturers could also lead to overcapacity in our target markets which could lead to price erosion that would adversely impact our operating results. Conversely, during periods of rapid increases in demand, our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy the demand. In addition, we may not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner, procure adequate resources and raw materials, locate suitable third-party suppliers, or respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to demand for new products requested by our customers, and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected.Our semiconductor products are complex and we may be subject to product warranty and indemnity claims, which could result in significant costs and damage to our reputation and adversely affect customer relationships, the market acceptance of our products and our operating results.Semiconductor products are highly complex and may contain defects when they are first introduced or as new versions are developed. Failures in our products and services or in the products of customers could result in damage to our reputation for reliability and increase our legal or financial exposure to third parties.  Certain of our products and services could also contain security vulnerabilities, defects, bugs and errors, which could also result in significant data losses, security breaches and theft of intellectual property.  We generally warrant our products to our customers for one year from the date title passes from us. We invest significant resources in the testing of our products; however, if any of our products contain defects, we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders. These problems may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or others, including liability for costs and expenses associated with product recalls, which may adversely impact our operating results. We may also be subject to customer indemnity claims. Our customers have on occasion been sued, and may be sued in the future, by third parties alleging infringement of intellectual property rights, or damages resulting from use of our products. Those customers may seek indemnification from us under the terms and conditions of our sales contracts with them. In certain cases, our potential indemnification liability may be significant. If any of our products contain defects, or have reliability, quality or compatibility problems, our reputation may be damaged, which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to customers and could also adversely affect our operating results.The fabrication of integrated circuits is highly complex and precise, and our manufacturing processes utilize a substantial amount of technology. Minute impurities, contaminants in the manufacturing environment, difficulties in the fabrication process, defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process, manufacturing equipment failures, wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional. While we have significant expertise in semiconductor manufacturing, it is possible that some processes could become unstable. 15This instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.We are occasionally involved in litigation, including claims regarding intellectual property rights, which could be costly to litigate and could require us to redesign products or pay significant royalties.The semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights, including claims arising under our contractual obligations to indemnify our customers. Other companies or individuals have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes, and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling infringing products, if those patents are found to be valid and infringed by us.  In the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property, and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement, and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel. We could also be subject to litigation or arbitration disputes arising under our contractual obligations, as well as indemnity, warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant costs and expenses as we defend those claims or pay damage awards. There can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities, and we may elect to self-insure with respect to certain matters. An adverse outcome in litigation or arbitration could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or on our operating results or cash flows in the period in which the dispute is resolved.We may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary intellectual property rights, which may limit our ability to compete effectively.Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We primarily rely on patent, mask work, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietary technologies and processes. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain, copy, reverse engineer, use or disclose our technologies, products and processes. Moreover, the laws of foreign countries in which we design, manufacture, market and sell our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary intellectual property. There can be no assurance that the claims allowed in our issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. In addition, any of our existing or future patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. As such, any rights granted under these patents may not provide us with adequate protection. We may not be able to obtain foreign patents or pending applications corresponding to our U.S. patents and applications. Even if patents are granted, enforcement may not be available or achieved under the circumstances. If our patents and mask works do not adequately protect our technology, our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours. Our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents.We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and strategic partners. We also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies, documentation and other proprietary information. Despite these efforts, internal or external parties may attempt to copy, disclose, obtain or use our products or technology without our authorization. Also, former employees may seek employment with our business partners, customers or competitors, and there can be no assurance that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment.A significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems could materially and adversely affect our business or reputation.  We rely on information technology systems throughout our company to keep financial records and customer data, process orders, manage inventory, coordinate shipments to customers, maintain confidential and proprietary information, assist in semiconductor engineering and other technical activities and operate other critical functions such as Internet connectivity, network communications and email.  Our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events.   We also utilize external cloud providers for certain infrastructure activities. If we were to experience a prolonged disruption in the information technology systems that involve our internal communications or our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business. We may also be subject to security breaches caused by computer viruses, illegal break-ins or hacking, sabotage, or acts of vandalism by third parties or our employees or contractors.  Our security measures or those of our third party service providers may not detect or prevent security breaches, defects, bugs or errors.  In addition, we provide our confidential and proprietary information to our strategic partners in certain cases where doing so is necessary to conduct our business.  While we employ confidentiality agreements to protect such information, nonetheless those third parties may also be subject to security breaches or otherwise compromise the protection of such information.  Security breaches of our information technology 16systems or those of our partners could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential and proprietary information belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage.If we are unable to recruit or retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our business strategy will be adversely affected.Our continued success depends to a significant extent upon the recruitment, retention and effective succession of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel, particularly our experienced engineers. The competition for these employees is intense. The loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. The inability to attract and retain key employees with critical technical skills to achieve our strategy could also have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, there could be a material adverse effect on our business should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel. We do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or employees.To remain competitive, we may need to invest in or acquire other companies, purchase or license technology from third parties, or enter into other strategic transactions in order to introduce new products or enhance our existing products.An element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisitions of businesses, assets, products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings, diversify our product portfolio, expand our market coverage, increase our engineering workforce, expand our technical skill sets or enhance our technological capabilities. We may not be able to find businesses that have the technology or resources we need and, if we find such businesses, we may not be able to invest in, purchase or license the technology or resources on commercially favorable terms or at all. Acquisitions, investments and technology licenses are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons, including the cost of potential transactions, competition among prospective buyers and licensees, the need for regulatory approvals, and difficulties related to integration efforts.  In addition, investments in private companies are subject to a risk of a partial or total loss of our investment.  Both in the U.S. and abroad, governmental regulation of acquisitions, including antitrust reviews and approvals, has become more complex, increasing the costs and risks of undertaking and consummating significant acquisitions. In order to finance a potential transaction, we may need to raise additional funds by issuing securities or borrowing money. We may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms, and the sale of our stock may result in the dilution of our existing shareholders or the issuance of securities with rights that are superior to the rights of our common shareholders.Acquisitions also involve a number of challenges and risks, including:•difficulty or delay integrating acquired technologies, operations and personnel with our existing businesses;•diversion of management's attention in connection with both negotiating the transaction and integrating the assets;•strain on managerial and operational resources as management tries to oversee larger or more complex operations;•the future funding requirements for acquired companies, which may be significant;•potential loss of key employees;•exposure to unforeseen liabilities or regulatory compliance issues of acquired companies; •higher than expected or unexpected costs relating to or associated with an acquisition and integration of assets;•difficulty realizing synergies and growth prospects of an acquisition in a timely manner or at all; and•increased risk of costly and time-consuming legal proceedings.If we are unable to successfully address these risks, we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of the acquisition, which may have an adverse effect on our business strategy, plans and operating results.We rely on supplies, services and manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable areas, which could affect our ability to produce products.We, like many companies in the semiconductor industry, rely on supplies, services, internal manufacturing capacity, wafer fabrication foundries and other subcontractors in geologically unstable locations around the world. Earthquakes, tsunamis, flooding or other natural disasters may disrupt local semiconductor-related businesses and adversely affect manufacturing capacity, availability and cost of key raw materials, utilities and equipment, and availability of key services, including transport of our products worldwide.  Our insurance may not adequately cover losses resulting from such disruptions.  Any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities, or those of our subcontractors or third-party wafer fabrication foundries, as a result of fire, flood, natural disaster, unavailability of utilities or otherwise, could result in a temporary or permanent loss of customers for affected products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.17We are exposed to business, economic, political, legal, regulatory and other risks through our significant worldwide operations, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We have significant operations and manufacturing facilities outside the United States, including in Ireland, the Philippines, Singapore and Malaysia. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from customers in international markets, and we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the future.  Risks associated with our international business operations include the following:  •political, legal and economic changes or instability and civil unrest in foreign markets;•currency conversion risks and exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations;•limitations on the repatriation of earnings;•trade and travel restrictions or government sanctions, including import or export tariffs or restrictions imposed by the U.S. government on trading with parties in foreign countries; •complex, varying and changing government regulations and legal standards and requirements, particularly with respect to price protection, competition practices, export control regulations and restrictions, customs and tax requirements, immigration, anti-boycott regulations, data privacy, intellectual property, anti-corruption and environmental compliance, including U.S. customs and export regulations and restrictions, International Traffic in Arms Regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;•economic disruption from terrorism and threats of terrorism and the response to them by the U.S. and its allies;•increased managerial complexities, including different employment practices and labor issues;•greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting such rights;•natural disasters or pandemics;•transportation disruptions and delays and increases in labor and transportation costs;•changes to foreign taxes, tariffs and freight rates;•fluctuations in raw material costs and energy costs;•greater difficulty in accounts receivable collections and longer collection periods; and•costs associated with our foreign defined benefit pension plans.Any of these risks, or any other risks related to international business operations, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Many of these risks are present in China.  While we expect to continue to expand our business and operations in China, our success in the Chinese markets may be adversely affected by China’s continuously evolving policies, laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs or restrictions, currency controls, antitrust, cybersecurity and data protection, the environment, indigenous innovation and the promotion of a domestic semiconductor industry, and intellectual property rights and enforcement and protection of those rights. Enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be inconsistent. In addition, changes in the political environment, governmental policies, international trade policies and relations, or U.S.-China relations could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, exposure of our proprietary intellectual property, increased taxation, and restrictions on imports, import duties or currency revaluations, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results. At October 28, 2017, our principal source of liquidity was $1.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, of which approximately $379.2 million was held in the United States and the remaining balance was held outside the United States in various foreign subsidiaries. As we intend to reinvest substantially all of our foreign earnings indefinitely, this cash held outside the United States is not available to meet certain aspects of our cash requirements in the United States. We require a substantial amount of cash in the United States for operating requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends and acquisitions. If we are unable to address our U.S. cash requirements through operations, borrowings under our current revolving credit facility, future debt or equity offerings or other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost, it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of earnings that are indefinitely reinvested, and we may be required to pay additional taxes under current tax laws, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Our operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors.A significant portion of our sales are through independent distributors that are not under our control. These independent distributors generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts applied to 18our products or they could terminate their representation of us. We generally do not require letters of credit from our distributors and are not protected against accounts receivable default or declarations of bankruptcy by these distributors. Our inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our operating results. Termination of a significant distributor or a group of distributors, whether at our initiative or the distributor’s initiative or through consolidation in the distribution industry, could disrupt our current business, and if we are unable to find suitable replacements, our operating results could be adversely affected.  We have also recently reduced the number of distributors we use, which may exacerbate the foregoing risks.We are subject to environmental, health and safety (EHS) regulations, which could increase our expenses and affect our operating results.Our industry is subject to EHS requirements, particularly those environmental requirements that control and restrict the sourcing, use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage and disposal of certain chemicals, and materials used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process. Public attention to environmental, sustainability and social responsibility concerns continues to increase, and our customers routinely include stringent environmental and other standards in their contracts with us. Changes in EHS laws or regulations may require us to invest in costly equipment or make manufacturing process changes and may adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products. In addition, we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability for damages caused by potential or actual releases of such materials. Any failure to control such materials adequately or to comply with existing or future EHS statutory or regulatory standards, requirements or contractual obligations could result in any of the following, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results:•liability for damages and remediation; •the imposition of regulatory penalties and civil and criminal fines; •the suspension or termination of the development, manufacture, sale or use of certain of our products; •changes to our manufacturing processes or a need to substitute materials that may cost more or be less available;•damage to our reputation; and/or •increased expenses associated with compliance.If we fail to comply with government contracting regulations, we could suffer a loss of revenue or incur price adjustments or other penalties.Some of our revenue is derived from contracts with agencies of the United States government and subcontracts with its prime contractors. As a United States government contractor or subcontractor, we are subject to federal contracting regulations, including the Federal Acquisition Regulations, which govern the allowability of costs incurred by us in the performance of United States government contracts. Certain contract pricing is based on estimated direct and indirect costs, which are subject to change. Additionally, the United States government is entitled after final payment on certain negotiated contracts to examine all of our cost records with respect to such contracts and to seek a downward adjustment to the price of the contract if it determines that we failed to furnish complete, accurate and current cost or pricing data in connection with the negotiation of the price of the contract.In connection with our United States government business, we are also subject to government audits and to review and approval of our policies, procedures, and internal controls for compliance with procurement regulations and applicable laws. In certain circumstances, if we do not comply with the terms of a contract or with regulations or statutes, we could be subject to downward contract price adjustments or refund obligations or could in extreme circumstances be assessed civil and criminal penalties or be debarred or suspended from obtaining future contracts for a specified period of time. Any such suspension or debarment or other sanction could have an adverse effect on our business.Under some of our government subcontracts, we are required to maintain secure facilities and to obtain security clearances for personnel involved in performance of the contract, in compliance with applicable federal standards. If we were unable to comply with these requirements, or if personnel critical to our performance of these contracts were unable to obtain or maintain their security clearances, we might be unable to perform these contracts or compete for other projects of this nature, which could adversely affect our revenue.Restrictions in our revolving credit facility, term loans and outstanding debt instruments may limit our activities.Our current revolving credit facility, term loans and outstanding debt instruments impose, and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may impose, restrictions that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our Company, including to undertake certain transactions, to create certain liens on our assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness. Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and changes in technology, government regulations and the level of competition. In 19addition, our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. If we breach any of the covenants under our revolving credit facility, the indentures governing our outstanding senior unsecured notes, the term loans or any future debt instruments to which we may become subject and do not obtain appropriate waivers, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness thereunder could be declared immediately due and payable or we may be restricted from further borrowing under our revolving credit facility.Our stock price may be volatile.The market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future, as it may be significantly affected by factors including:•global economic conditions generally;•crises in global credit, debt and financial markets;•actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and operating results;•changes in financial estimates or other statements made by securities analysts or others in analyst reports or other publications or our failure to perform in line with those estimates or statements or our published guidance;•financial results and prospects of our customers;•U.S. and foreign government actions;•changes in market valuations of other semiconductor companies;•rumors and speculation in the press, investment community or on social media about us, our customers or other companies in our industry;•announcements by us, our customers or our competitors of significant new products, technical innovations, material transactions, acquisitions or dispositions, litigation, capital commitments or revised earnings estimates;•departures of key personnel;•alleged noncompliance with laws, regulations or ethics standards by us or any of our employees, officers or directors; and•negative media publicity targeting us or our suppliers, customers or competitors.The stock market has historically experienced volatility, especially within the semiconductor industry, that often has been unrelated to the performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless of our operating results.Our directors and executive officers periodically sell shares of our common stock in the market, including pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans.  Regardless of the individual's reasons for such sales, securities analysts and investors could view such sales as a negative indicator and our stock price could be adversely affected as a result"
12,ADI,ANALOG DEVICES,2016-11-22,"ITEM 1A.     RISK FACTORSSet forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the SEC are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report.Risks Related to the Proposed Acquisition of Linear Technology CorporationOur ability to complete the acquisition of Linear Technology Corporation (Linear) is subject to various closing conditions, including the receipt of consents and approvals from governmental authorities, which may impose conditions that could adversely affect us or cause the acquisition to be abandoned.          We and Linear must make certain filings with, and obtain certain consents and approvals from, various governmental and regulatory authorities.  We have not yet obtained all regulatory consents and approvals required to complete the acquisition. Governmental or regulatory agencies could seek to block or challenge the acquisition. Even if these regulatory consents and approvals are obtained, the governmental authorities from which these approvals are required may impose conditions on the completion of the acquisition, including requiring significant divestitures or placing restrictions on the conduct of the combined company’s business, which could have an adverse effect on the combined company following the acquisition. The merger agreement may require us to accept certain conditions from these regulators that could adversely impact the combined company. If we agree to undertake divestitures or comply with operating restrictions in order to obtain any approvals required to complete the acquisition, we may be less able to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, and the business and results of operations of the combined company after the acquisition may be adversely affected. If all required regulatory consents and approvals are not received, or they are not received on terms that satisfy the conditions set forth in the merger agreement, then neither we nor Linear will be obligated to complete the acquisition.  Under the merger agreement, we could be required, under certain circumstances, to pay Linear a termination fee of $700 million. If such a termination fee is payable, the payment of this fee could have material and adverse consequences to our financial condition and operations. The applicable waiting period for the acquisition under the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, expired on October 19, 2016, and as a result, the acquisition has been cleared for U.S. antitrust purposes. In addition, we have received clearances for the acquisition from antitrust regulators in Germany, Japan and Israel.         We can provide no assurance that the various closing conditions will be satisfied and that the necessary approvals will be obtained, or that any required conditions will not materially adversely affect the combined company following the acquisition. In addition, we can provide no assurance that these conditions will not result in the abandonment or delay of the acquisition. The occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and the trading price of our common stock.We will incur significant acquisition-related costs in connection with the Linear acquisition and the combined company could incur substantial expenses related to the integration of Linear.          We expect to incur costs associated with combining our operations with Linear’s operations, as well as transaction fees and other costs related to the acquisition. Many of these costs will be borne by us even if the acquisition is not completed. We will incur through completion of the acquisition, and the combined company will incur following the completion of the acquisition, substantial expenses in connection with integrating each company’s respective businesses, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems. These integration expenses may result in significant charges taken against earnings by us prior to completion of the acquisition and by the combined company following the completion of the acquisition. We will incur significant indebtedness in connection with the merger, which could reduce our flexibility to operate our business and increase our interest expense. In connection with the planned acquisition, we entered into a commitment letter, dated as of July 26, 2016 (the “Commitment Letter”), with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Bank of America, N.A., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated, Credit Suisse AG, and Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC, which was subsequently joined on August 10, 2016 by The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd. (together, the Commitment Parties), pursuant to which the Commitment Parties committed to arrange and provide, subject to the terms and conditions of the Commitment Letter, a 364-day senior unsecured bridge facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $7.5 billion and a 90-day senior unsecured bridge facility in an aggregate principal amount of up to $4.1 billion.  On September 23, 2016, we entered into a term loan facility composed of a $2.5 billion three-year unsecured term loan facility and $2.5 billion five-year unsecured term loan facility (collectively, the Term Loan Facility) and an amended and restated revolving credit agreement (Revolving Credit Facility), which expires on July 10, 2020.  Borrowings under the Term Loan Facility are available upon consummation of the planned acquisition of Linear.  Additionally, upon the consummation of the planned acquisition of Linear, the aggregate commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility will increase from $750 million to $1 billion, and certain other amendments to the Revolving Credit 11Facility will become effective.   As a result of our entry into the Term Loan Facility, the commitments under the 364-day senior unsecured bridge facility were reduced from $7.5 billion to $2.5 billion.  Upon consummation of the merger, our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness when due depends upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations, many of which are beyond our control.  In addition, the amount of cash required to make principal and interest payments on our increased indebtedness levels following completion of the merger, and thus the demands on our cash resources, will be greater than the amount of cash flows required to service our indebtedness prior to the completion of the merger.  This increased indebtedness could also have the effect, among other things, of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes and may create competitive disadvantages relative to other companies with lower debt levels. If we do not achieve the expected benefits and cost savings from the merger, or if the financial performance of the combined company does not meet current expectations, then our ability to service our indebtedness may be adversely impacted.The market value of our common stock could decline if large amounts of our common stock are sold following the Linear acquisition.            Following the acquisition, our shareholders and former Linear stockholders will own interests in a combined company operating an expanded business with more assets and a different mix of liabilities. Our current shareholders and the current Linear stockholders may not wish to continue to invest in the combined company, or may wish to reduce their investment in the combined company, in order to comply with institutional investing guidelines, to increase diversification or to track any rebalancing of stock indices in which our or Linear’s common stock is or was included. If, following the acquisition, large amounts of our common stock are sold, the price of our common stock could decline. The pendency of the Linear acquisition could adversely affect us.          In connection with the pending acquisition, some of our suppliers and customers may delay or defer sales and purchasing decisions, which could negatively impact revenues, earnings and cash flows regardless of whether the acquisition is completed.           Following the Linear acquisition, the combined company may encounter difficulties in integrating our and Linear’s businesses and realizing the anticipated benefits of the acquisition.          The acquisition involves the combination of two companies which currently operate as independent public companies. The combined company will be required to devote management attention and resources to integrating its business practices and operations, and prior to the acquisition, management attention and resources will be required to plan for such integration. Potential difficulties the combined company may encounter in the integration process include the following: •the inability to successfully integrate the respective businesses of the two companies in a manner that permits the combined company to achieve the cost savings and operating synergies anticipated to result from the acquisition, which could result in the anticipated benefits of the acquisition not being realized partly or wholly in the time frame currently anticipated or at all;•lost sales and customers as a result of certain customers of either or both of the two companies deciding not to do business with the combined company, or deciding to decrease their amount of business in order to reduce their reliance on a single company; •integrating personnel and IT systems from the two companies while maintaining focus on providing consistent, high quality products and services;•potential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with the acquisition; and•performance shortfalls at one or both of the two companies as a result of the diversion of management’s attention caused by completing the acquisition and integrating the companies’ operations.Any of these factors could result in the combined company failing to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, on the expected timeline or at all.Risks Relating to the BusinessDisruptions in global credit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.There is significant continuing uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets. These economic uncertainties may lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending, which may cause our customers to cancel, decrease or delay their existing and future orders for our products and make it difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities.  Significant disruption to global credit and financial markets may also adversely affect our ability to access 12external financing sources on acceptable terms.  Financial difficulties experienced by our customers could result in nonpayment or payment delays for previously purchased products, thereby increasing our credit risk exposure.  Uncertainty regarding the future stability of the global credit and financial markets could cause the value of the currency in the affected markets to deteriorate, thus reducing the purchasing power of those customers. In addition, financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or distributors could result in product delays, increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges. During the past few years, many governments adopted stimulus or spending programs designed to ease the economic impact of the crisis. Some of our businesses benefited from these stimulus programs but there can be no assurance that such programs will continue in the future. If economic conditions deteriorate, we may record additional charges relating to restructuring costs or the impairment of assets and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.Our future revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate.Our future revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors, including:•the effects of adverse economic conditions in the markets in which we sell our products;•changes in customer demand for our products and/or for end products that incorporate our products;•the timing, delay, reduction or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability to manage inventory;•fluctuations in customer order patterns and seasonality;•our ability to effectively manage our cost structure in both the short term and over a longer duration;•changes in geographic, product or customer mix;•changes in our effective tax rates in the United States, Ireland or worldwide; •the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us, our customers or our competitors and the market acceptance of such products;•competitive pricing pressures;•fluctuations in manufacturing yields, adequate availability of wafers and other raw materials, and manufacturing, assembly and test capacity;•the ability of our third-party suppliers, subcontractors and manufacturers to supply us with sufficient quantities of raw materials, products and/or components;•a decline in infrastructure spending by foreign governments, including China;•a decline in the U.S. Government defense budget, changes in spending or budgetary priorities, a prolonged U.S. Government shutdown or delays in contract awards;•any significant decline in our backlog;•our ability to recruit, hire, retain and motivate adequate numbers of engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of our customers;•our ability to generate new design opportunities and win competitive bid selection processes;•the increasing costs of providing employee benefits, including health insurance, retirement plan and pension plan contributions and retirement benefits; •our ability to utilize our manufacturing facilities at efficient levels;•potential significant litigation-related costs or product warranty and/or indemnity claims, including those not covered by our suppliers or insurers;•the difficulties inherent in forecasting future operating expense levels, including with respect to costs associated with labor, utilities, transportation and raw materials;•the costs related to compliance with increasing worldwide government, environmental and social responsibility regulations; •new accounting pronouncements or changes in existing accounting standards and practices; and13•the effects of public health emergencies, natural disasters, widespread travel disruptions, security risks, terrorist activities, international conflicts, government sanctions and other events beyond our control.In addition, the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic upturns and downturns. Our business and certain of the end markets we serve are also subject to rapid technological changes and material fluctuations in demand based on end-user preferences.  There can be no assurance (i) that products stocked in our inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them, or (ii) that we will be able to design, develop and produce products in a timely fashion to accommodate changing customer demand. As a result of these and other factors, we may experience material fluctuations in future revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share on a quarterly or annual basis.  Our historical financial performance and results of operations should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance or results.  In addition, if our revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share results or expectations do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the market price of our common stock may decline.Increases in our effective tax rate and exposure to additional tax liabilities may adversely impact our results of operations.Our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned.  Our effective tax rate in 2016 was below the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35%, primarily due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income.  A number of factors may increase our future effective tax rate, including: new or revised tax laws or legislation or the interpretation of such laws or legislation by governmental authorities; increases in tax rates in various jurisdictions; variation in the mix of jurisdictions in which our profits are earned and taxed; repatriation of non-U.S. earnings; any adverse resolution of ongoing tax audits or adverse rulings from taxing authorities worldwide; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including executive compensation subject to the limitations of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code and amortization of assets acquired in connection with strategic transactions; decreased availability of tax deductions for stock-based compensation awards worldwide; and changes in available tax credits. Any significant increase in our future effective tax rate could adversely impact our net income during future periods.  On October 5, 2015, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), an international association of thirty four countries, including the U.S. and UK, released the final reports from its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action Plans. The BEPS recommendations covered a number of issues, including country-by-country reporting, permanent establishment rules, transfer pricing rules and tax treaties. Future tax reform resulting from this development may result in changes to long-standing tax principles, which could adversely affect our effective tax rate or result in higher cash tax liabilities.Long-term contracts are not typical for us and incorrect forecasts or reductions, cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results.We typically do not have long-term sales contracts with our customers. In certain markets where end-user demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict, some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment, even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all, or even any, of the product. In other instances, we manufacture product based on forecasts of customer demands, which may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis. Additionally, our U.S. government contracts and subcontracts may be funded in increments over a number of government budget periods and typically can be terminated by the government for its convenience.  As a result, we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales, and we are subject to the risk of lower than expected orders or cancellations of orders, leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog. Further, orders or forecasts for products that meet the customer’s unique requirements and that are canceled or unrealized orders would, in addition, result in an inventory of unsaleable products, causing potential inventory write-offs, and we may be unable to recover all of our costs incurred or committed. As a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the products that are subject to these uncertainties, the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial. Incorrect forecasts, or reductions, cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results.Our future success depends upon our ability to execute our business strategy, continue to innovate, improve our existing products, design, develop, produce and market new products, and identify and enter new markets.Our future success significantly depends on our continued ability to execute our business strategy, continue to improve our existing products and design, develop, produce and market innovative new products. Product design, development, innovation and enhancement is often a complex, time-consuming and costly process involving significant investment in research and development, with no assurance of return on investment. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new and improved products in a timely or efficient manner or that new and improved products, if developed, will achieve market acceptance. Our products generally must conform to various evolving and sometimes competing industry standards, which may adversely affect our ability to compete in certain markets or require us to incur 14significant costs. In addition, our customers generally impose very high quality and reliability standards on our products, which often change and may be difficult or costly to satisfy. Any inability to satisfy customer quality and reliability standards or comply with industry standards and technical requirements may adversely affect demand for our products and our results of operations. In addition, our growth is dependent on our ability to generate new design opportunities and win competitive bid selection processes.  Failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product, which could weaken our position in future competitive selection processes.  Our growth is also dependent on our ability to identify and penetrate new markets where we have limited experience and competition is intense. Some of our customers in new markets are less established, which could subject us to increased credit risk. There can be no assurance that the markets we serve and/or target based on our business strategy will grow in the future, that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets, that our products, or the products in which our products are used, will achieve customer acceptance in these markets, that competitors will not force price reductions or take market share from us, or that we can achieve or maintain adequate gross margins or profits in these markets. Additionally, developing markets, such as the developing Internet of Things (IoT) market, require significant investments, resources and technological advancement in order to compete effectively and there can be no assurance that we will achieve success in these markets.  Furthermore, a decline in demand in one or several of our end-user markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations.We may not be able to compete successfully in markets within the semiconductor industry in the future.We face intense competition in the semiconductor industry, and we expect this competition to increase in the future, including from companies located outside of the United States. Competition is generally based on innovation, design, quality and reliability of products, product performance, features and functionality, product pricing, availability and capacity, technological service and support, and the availability of integrated system solutions, with the relative importance of these factors varying among products, markets and customers. Many companies have sufficient financial, manufacturing, technical, sales and marketing resources to develop and market products that compete with our products. Some of our competitors may have more advantageous supply or development relationships with our current and potential customers or suppliers. Our competitors also include emerging companies selling specialized products in markets we serve and entities outside of the U.S., including entities associated with efforts by foreign governments to create indigenous semiconductor industries.  Existing or new competitors may develop products or technologies that more effectively address the demands of our customers and markets with enhanced performance, features and functionality, lower power requirements, greater levels of integration or lower cost. In addition, as we seek to expand our business, including the design and production of products and services for the IoT market, we may encounter increased competition from our current competitors and/or new competitors.  Increased competition in certain markets has resulted in and may continue to result in declining average selling prices, reduced gross margins and loss of market share in those markets. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors, or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased competition.  In addition, the semiconductor industry has experienced significant consolidation over the past several years.  Consolidation among our competitors could lead to a changing competitive landscape, which could negatively impact our competitive position and market share and harm our results of operations.We rely on third-party suppliers, subcontractors and manufacturers for some industry-standard wafers, manufacturing processes, assembly and test services, and transportation, and we generally cannot control their availability or conditions of supply.We rely, and plan to continue to rely, on third-party suppliers, assembly and test subcontractors, freight carriers and  wafer fabricators (collectively, suppliers) to supply most of our wafers that can be manufactured using industry-standard submicron processes. This reliance involves several risks, including reduced control over availability, capacity utilization, delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, and costs. We currently source approximately 60% of our wafer requirements annually from third-party wafer fabrication foundries, primarily Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, TSMC. In addition, these suppliers often provide manufacturing services to our competitors and therefore periods of increased industry demand may result in capacity constraints. In certain instances, the third-party supplier is the sole source of highly specialized processing services. If our suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver components to us on the time schedule and of the quality or quantity that we require or provide us with required manufacturing processes, we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers, which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers. If additional or replacement suppliers or manufacturing processes are not available, we may also experience delays in product development or shipment which could, in turn, result in the temporary or permanent loss of customers.The markets for semiconductor products are cyclical, and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices, and conversely, we may not be able to satisfy unexpected demand for our products.15The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly.  The demand for our products is subject to the strength of our four major end markets of Industrial, Communications Infrastructure, Automotive and Consumer.  If we expand our operations and workforce too rapidly or procure excessive resources in anticipation of increased demand for our products, and that demand does not materialize at the pace at which we expect, or declines, or if we overbuild inventory in a period of decreased demand, our operating results may be adversely affected as a result of increased operating expenses, reduced margins, underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges. These capacity expansions by us and other semiconductor manufacturers could also lead to overcapacity in our target markets which could lead to price erosion that would adversely impact our operating results. Conversely, during periods of rapid increases in demand, our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy the demand. In addition, we may not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner, procure adequate resources and raw materials, locate suitable third-party suppliers, or respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to demand for new products requested by our customers, and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected.Our semiconductor products are complex and we may be subject to product warranty and indemnity claims, which could result in significant costs and damage to our reputation and adversely affect the market acceptance of our products.Semiconductor products are highly complex and may contain defects when they are first introduced or as new versions are developed. We generally warrant our products to our customers for one year from the date title passes from us. We invest significant resources in the testing of our products; however, if any of our products contain defects, we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs, pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders. These problems may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or others, including liability for costs associated with product recalls, which may adversely impact our operating results. We may also be subject to customer indemnity claims. Our customers have on occasion been sued, and may be sued in the future, by third parties alleging infringement of intellectual property rights, or damages resulting from use of our products. Those customers may seek indemnification from us under the terms and conditions of our sales contracts with them. In certain cases, our potential indemnification liability may be significant. If any of our products contains defects, or has reliability, quality or compatibility problems, our reputation may be damaged, which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could also adversely affect our operating results.We have manufacturing processes that utilize a substantial amount of technology as the fabrication of integrated circuits is a highly complex and precise process. Minute impurities, contaminants in the manufacturing environment, difficulties in the fabrication process, defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process, manufacturing equipment failures, wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional. While we have significant expertise in semiconductor manufacturing, it is possible that some processes could become unstable. This instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.We are involved in frequent litigation, including claims regarding intellectual property rights, which could be costly to bring or defend and could require us to redesign products or pay significant royalties.The semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights, including claims arising under our contractual obligations to indemnify our customers. Other companies or individuals have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes, and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling infringing products, if those patents are found to be valid and infringed by us.  In the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property, and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement, and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel. We could also be subject to litigation or arbitration disputes arising under our contractual obligations, as well as indemnity, warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant costs and expenses as we defend those claims or pay damage awards. There can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities, and we may elect to self-insure with respect to certain matters. We may incur costs and expenses relating to a recall of our customers’ products due to an alleged failure of components we supply. An adverse outcome in litigation or arbitration could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or on our operating results or cash flows in the period in which the dispute is resolved.We may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary intellectual property rights, which may limit our ability to compete effectively.16Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We primarily rely on patent, mask work, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietary technologies and processes. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain, copy, reverse engineer, use or disclose our technologies, products and processes. Moreover, the laws of foreign countries in which we design, manufacture, market and sell our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary intellectual property. There can be no assurance that the claims allowed in our issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. In addition, any of our existing or future patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. As such, any rights granted under these patents may not provide us with adequate protection. We may not be able to obtain foreign patents or pending applications corresponding to our U.S. patents and applications. Even if foreign patents are granted, effective enforcement in foreign countries may not be available. If our patents and mask works do not adequately protect our technology, our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours. Our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents.We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and strategic partners. We also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies, documentation and other proprietary information. Despite these efforts, internal or external parties may attempt to copy, disclose, obtain or use our products or technology without our authorization. Also, former employees may seek employment with our business partners, customers or competitors, and there can be no assurance that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment.A significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems could materially and adversely affect our business or reputation.  We rely on information technology systems throughout our Company to keep financial records and customer data, process orders, manage inventory, coordinate shipments to customers, maintain confidential and proprietary information, assist in semiconductor engineering and other technical activities and operate other critical functions such as Internet connectivity, network communications and email.  Our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events.   If we were to experience a prolonged disruption in the information technology systems that involve our internal communications or our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business. We may also be subject to security breaches caused by computer viruses, illegal break-ins or hacking, sabotage, or acts of vandalism by third parties.  Our security measures or those of our third party service providers may not detect or prevent security breaches.  In addition, we provide our confidential and proprietary information to our strategic partners in certain cases where doing so is necessary to conduct our business.  While we employ confidentiality agreements to protect such information, nonetheless those third parties may also be subject to security breaches or otherwise compromise the protection of such information.  Security breaches of our information technology systems or those of our partners could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential and proprietary information belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage.If we do not retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our business strategy will be adversely affected.Our continued success depends to a significant extent upon the recruitment, retention and effective succession of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel, particularly our experienced engineers. The competition for these employees is intense. The loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, there could be a material adverse effect on our business should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel. We do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or employees.To remain competitive, we may need to invest in or acquire other companies, purchase or license technology from third parties, or enter into other strategic transactions in order to introduce new products or enhance our existing products.An element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisitions of businesses, assets, products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings, diversify our product portfolio, expand our market coverage, increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities. We may not be able to find businesses that have the technology or resources we need and, if we find such businesses, we may not be able to invest in, purchase or license the technology or resources on commercially favorable terms or at all. Acquisitions, investments and technology licenses are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons, including the cost of potential transactions, competition among prospective buyers and licensees, the need for regulatory approvals, and difficulties related to integration efforts.  In addition, investments in early-to-late stage private companies are subject to a risk of a partial or total loss of our investment.  17Both in the U.S. and abroad, governmental regulation of acquisitions, including antitrust reviews and approvals, has become more complex, increasing the costs and risks of undertaking and consummating significant acquisitions. In order to finance a potential transaction, we may need to raise additional funds by issuing securities or borrowing money. We may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms, and the sale of our stock may result in the dilution of our existing shareholders or the issuance of securities with rights that are superior to the rights of our common shareholders.Acquisitions also involve a number of risks, including:•difficulty or delay integrating acquired technologies, operations and personnel with our existing businesses;•diversion of management's attention in connection with both negotiating the transaction and integrating the assets;•strain on managerial and operational resources as management tries to oversee larger or more complex operations;•the future funding requirements for acquired companies, which may be significant;•potential loss of key employees;•exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies; •higher than expected or unexpected costs relating to or associated with an acquisition and integration of assets;•difficulty realizing synergies and growth prospects of an acquisition in a timely manner or at all; and•increased risk of costly and time-consuming litigation.If we are unable to successfully address these risks, we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of the acquisition, which may have an adverse effect on our business strategy, plans and operating results.We rely on supplies, services and manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable areas, which could affect our ability to produce products.We, like many companies in the semiconductor industry, rely on supplies, services, internal manufacturing capacity, wafer fabrication foundries and other subcontractors in geologically unstable locations around the world. Earthquakes, tsunamis, flooding or other natural disasters may disrupt local semiconductor-related businesses and adversely affect manufacturing capacity, availability and cost of key raw materials, utilities and equipment, and availability of key services, including transport of our products worldwide.  Our insurance may not adequately cover losses resulting from such disruptions.  Any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities, or those of our subcontractors or third-party wafer fabrication foundries, as a result of fire, flood, natural disaster, unavailability of utilities or otherwise, could result in a temporary or permanent loss of customers for affected products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.We are exposed to business, economic, political, legal, regulatory and other risks through our significant worldwide operations, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We have significant operations and manufacturing facilities outside the United States, including in Ireland and the Philippines. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from customers in international markets, and we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the future.  Risks associated with our international business operations include the following:  •political, legal and economic changes or instability and civil unrest in foreign markets;•currency conversion risks and exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations;•limitations on the repatriation of earnings;•trade and travel restrictions or government sanctions, including restrictions imposed by the U.S. government on trading with parties in foreign countries; •complex and varying government regulations and legal standards, particularly with respect to price protection, competition practices, export control regulations and restrictions, customs and tax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, data privacy, intellectual property, anti-corruption and environmental compliance, including U.S. customs and export regulations and restrictions, including International Traffic in Arms Regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;•economic disruption from terrorism and threats of terrorism and the response to them by the U.S. and its allies;•increased managerial complexities, including different employment practices and labor issues;18•greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting such rights;•natural disasters or pandemics;•transportation disruptions and delays and increases in labor and transportation costs;•changes to foreign taxes, tariffs and freight rates;•fluctuations in raw material costs and energy costs;•greater difficulty in accounts receivable collections and longer collection periods; and•costs associated with our foreign defined benefit pension plans.Any of these risks, or any other risks related to international business operations, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Many of these risks are present in China.  While we expect to continue to expand our business and operations in China, our success in the Chinese markets may be adversely affected by China’s continuously evolving policies, laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs or restrictions, currency controls, antitrust, the environment, indigenous innovation and the promotion of a domestic semiconductor industry, and intellectual property rights and enforcement and protection of those rights. Enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be inconsistent. In addition, changes in the political environment, governmental policies, international trade policies and relations, or U.S.-China relations could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, exposure of our proprietary intellectual property, increased taxation, and restrictions on imports, import duties or currency revaluations, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results. At October 29, 2016, our principal source of liquidity was $4.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, of which approximately $725.8 million was held in the United States and the remaining balance was held outside the United States in various foreign subsidiaries. As we intend to reinvest substantially all of our foreign earnings indefinitely, this cash held outside the United States is not available to meet certain aspects of our cash requirements in the United States. We require a substantial amount of cash in the United States for operating requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends and acquisitions. If we are unable to address our U.S. cash requirements through operations, borrowings under our current credit facility, future debt or equity offerings or other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost, it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of earnings that are indefinitely reinvested, and we may be required to pay additional taxes under current tax laws, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Our operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors.A significant portion of our sales are through independent distributors that are not under our control. These independent distributors generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts applied to our products or they could terminate their representation of us. We generally do not require letters of credit from our distributors and are not protected against accounts receivable default or declarations of bankruptcy by these distributors. Our inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our operating results. Termination of a significant distributor or a group of distributors, whether at our initiative or the distributor’s initiative or through consolidation in the distribution industry, could disrupt our current business, and if we are unable to find suitable replacements, our operating results could be adversely affected.We are subject to environmental, health and safety (EHS) regulations, which could increase our expenses and affect our operating results.Our industry is subject to EHS requirements, particularly those environmental requirements that control and restrict the sourcing, use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage and disposal of certain chemicals, minerals, elements and materials used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process. Public attention to environmental, sustainability and social responsibility concerns continues to increase, and our customers routinely include stringent environmental and other standards in their contracts with us. Changes in EHS laws or regulations may require us to invest in costly equipment or alter the way our products are made and may adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products. In addition, we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability for damages caused by potential or actual releases of such materials. Any failure to control such materials adequately or to comply with existing or future EHS statutory or regulatory standards, requirements or contractual obligations could result in liability for damages and remediation; the imposition of regulatory penalties and civil and criminal fines; the suspension or termination of the development, manufacture, sale or use of certain of our products; changes to our manufacturing processes or a need to substitute materials that may cost more or be less available; damage to our reputation; and/or increased expenses associated with compliance, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.19If we fail to comply with government contracting regulations, we could suffer a loss of revenue or incur price adjustments or other penalties.Some of our revenue is derived from contracts with agencies of the United States government and subcontracts with its prime contractors. As a United States government contractor or subcontractor, we are subject to federal contracting regulations, including the Federal Acquisition Regulations, which govern the allowability of costs incurred by us in the performance of United States government contracts. Certain contract pricing is based on estimated direct and indirect costs, which are subject to change. Additionally, the United States government is entitled after final payment on certain negotiated contracts to examine all of our cost records with respect to such contracts and to seek a downward adjustment to the price of the contract if it determines that we failed to furnish complete, accurate and current cost or pricing data in connection with the negotiation of the price of the contract.In connection with our United States government business, we are also subject to government audits and to review and approval of our policies, procedures, and internal controls for compliance with procurement regulations and applicable laws. In certain circumstances, if we do not comply with the terms of a contract or with regulations or statutes, we could be subject to downward contract price adjustments or refund obligations or could in extreme circumstances be assessed civil and criminal penalties or be debarred or suspended from obtaining future contracts for a specified period of time. Any such suspension or debarment or other sanction could have an adverse effect on our business.Under some of our government subcontracts, we are required to maintain secure facilities and to obtain security clearances for personnel involved in performance of the contract, in compliance with applicable federal standards. If we were unable to comply with these requirements, or if personnel critical to our performance of these contracts were unable to obtain or maintain their security clearances, we might be unable to perform these contracts or compete for other projects of this nature, which could adversely affect our revenue.If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow, we may not be able to service our debt obligations, including making payments on our outstanding senior unsecured notes.In June 2013, we issued in a public offering $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.875% senior unsecured notes due June 1, 2023 (the 2023 Notes).  In December 2015, we issued in a public offering $850.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.9% senior unsecured notes due December 15, 2025 (the 2025 Notes) and $400.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.3% senior unsecured notes due December 15, 2045 (the 2045 Notes, and together with the 2023 Notes and the 2025 Notes, the Notes).  Our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness when due depends upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our outstanding debt, we may be required to, among other things:•seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets;•refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness, including the Notes;•borrow under our existing revolving credit facility;•divert funds that would otherwise be invested in our operations;•repatriate earnings at higher tax rates that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign locations;•sell selected assets; or•reduce or delay planned capital expenditures or operating expenditures.Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt, including the Notes, which could negatively impact our financial results. In addition, any such financing, refinancing or sale of assets might not be possible on economically favorable terms.Restrictions in our revolving credit facility and outstanding debt instruments may limit our activities.Our current revolving credit facility and the Notes impose, and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may impose, restrictions that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our Company, including to undertake certain transactions, to create certain liens on our assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness. Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, changes in technology and changes in the level of competition. In addition, our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. If we breach any of the covenants under our revolving credit facility, the indentures governing the Notes, the Term Loan Facility or any future debt instruments to which we may become subject and do 20not obtain appropriate waivers, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness thereunder could be declared immediately due and payable or we may be restricted from further borrowing under our revolving credit facility.Our stock price may be volatile.The market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future, as it may be significantly affected by factors including:•global economic conditions generally;•crises in global credit, debt and financial markets;•actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and operating results;•changes in financial estimates or other statements made by securities analysts or others in analyst reports or other publications or our failure to perform in line with those estimates or statements or our published guidance;•changes in market valuations of other semiconductor companies;•rumors and speculation in the press, investment community or on social media about us or other companies in our industry;•announcements by us or our competitors of significant new products, technical innovations, material transactions, acquisitions or dispositions, litigation, capital commitments or revised earnings estimates;•departures of key personnel;•alleged noncompliance with laws, regulations or ethics standards by us or any of our employees, officers or directors; and•negative media publicity targeting us or our suppliers, customers or competitors.The stock market has historically experienced volatility, especially within the semiconductor industry, that often has been unrelated to the performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless of our operating results.Our directors and executive officers periodically sell shares of our common stock in the market, including pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans.  Regardless of the individual's reasons for such sales, securities analysts and investors could view such sales as a negative indicator and our stock price could be adversely affected as a result"
10,ADI,ANALOG DEVICES,2015-11-24,"ITEM 1A.     RISK FACTORSSet forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the SEC are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report.Disruptions in global credit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.There is significant continuing uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets. These economic uncertainties may lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending, which may cause our customers to cancel, decrease or delay their existing and future orders for our products and make it difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities.  Significant disruption to global credit and financial markets may also adversely affect our ability to access external financing sources on acceptable terms.  Financial difficulties experienced by our customers could result in nonpayment or payment delays for previously purchased products, thereby increasing our credit risk exposure.  Uncertainty regarding the future stability of the global credit and financial markets could cause the value of the currency in the affected markets to deteriorate, thus reducing the purchasing power of those customers. In addition, financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or distributors could result in product delays, increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges. During the past few years, many governments adopted stimulus or spending programs designed to ease the economic impact of the crisis. Some of our businesses benefited from these stimulus programs but there can be no assurance that such programs will continue in the future. If economic conditions deteriorate, we may record additional charges relating to restructuring costs or the impairment of assets and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.Our future revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate.Our future revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors, including:•the effects of adverse economic conditions in the markets in which we sell our products;•changes in customer demand for our products and/or for end products that incorporate our products;•our ability to effectively manage our cost structure in both the short term and over a longer duration;•changes in geographic, product or customer mix;•changes in our effective tax rates in the United States, Ireland or worldwide; •the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us, our customers or our competitors;•competitive pricing pressures;•fluctuations in manufacturing yields, adequate availability of wafers and other raw materials, and manufacturing, assembly and test capacity;•the ability of our third-party suppliers, subcontractors and manufacturers to supply us with sufficient quantities of raw materials, products and/or components;•a decline in infrastructure spending by foreign governments, including China;•a decline in the U.S. Government defense budget, changes in spending or budgetary priorities, a prolonged U.S. Government shutdown or delays in contract awards;•any significant decline in our backlog;•the timing, delay, reduction or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability to manage inventory;•our ability to recruit, hire, retain and motivate adequate numbers of engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of our customers;•the increasing costs of providing employee benefits, including health insurance, pension plan and retirement plan contributions and retirement benefits; •our ability to utilize our manufacturing facilities at efficient levels;•potential significant litigation-related costs or product warranty and/or indemnity claims, including those not covered by our suppliers or insurers;11•the difficulties inherent in forecasting future operating expense levels, including with respect to costs associated with labor, utilities, transportation and raw materials;•the costs related to compliance with increasing worldwide government, environmental and social responsibility regulations; and•the effects of public health emergencies, natural disasters, widespread travel disruptions, security risks, terrorist activities, international conflicts, government sanctions and other events beyond our control.In addition, the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic upturns and downturns. Our business and certain of the end markets we serve are also subject to rapid technological changes and material fluctuations in demand based on end-user preferences.  There can be no assurance (i) that products stocked in our inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them, or (ii) that we will be able to design, develop and produce products in a timely fashion to accommodate changing customer demand. As a result of these and other factors, we may experience material fluctuations in future revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share on a quarterly or annual basis.  Our historical financial performance and results of operations should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance or results.  In addition, if our revenue, gross margins, operating results, net income and earnings per share do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the market price of our common stock may decline.Increases in our effective tax rate and exposure to additional tax liabilities may adversely impact our results of operations.Our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned.  Our effective tax rate in 2015 was below the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35%, primarily due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income.  A number of factors may increase our future effective tax rate, including: new or revised tax laws or legislation (including proposed revisions to Irish tax laws) or the interpretation of such laws or legislation by governmental authorities; increases in tax rates in various jurisdictions; variation in the mix of jurisdictions in which our profits are earned and taxed; repatriation of non-U.S. earnings; any adverse resolution of ongoing tax audits or adverse rulings from taxing authorities worldwide; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including executive compensation subject to the limitations of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code and amortization of assets acquired in connection with strategic transactions; decreased availability of tax deductions for stock-based compensation awards worldwide; and changes in available tax credits. Any significant increase in our future effective tax rate could adversely impact our net income during future periods.Long-term contracts are not typical for us and incorrect forecasts or reductions, cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results.We typically do not have long-term sales contracts with our customers. In certain markets where end-user demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict, some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment, even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all, or even any, of the product. In other instances, we manufacture product based on forecasts of customer demands, which may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis. Additionally, our U.S. government contracts and subcontracts may be funded in increments over a number of government budget periods and typically can be terminated by the government for its convenience.  As a result, we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales, and we are subject to the risk of lower than expected orders or cancellations of orders, leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog. Further, orders or forecasts for products that meet the customer’s unique requirements and that are canceled or unrealized orders would, in addition, result in an inventory of unsaleable products, causing potential inventory write-offs, and we may be unable to recover all of our costs incurred or committed. As a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the products that are subject to these uncertainties, the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial. Incorrect forecasts, or reductions, cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results.Our future success depends upon our ability to execute our business strategy, continue to innovate, improve our existing products, design, develop, produce and market new products, and identify and enter new markets.Our future success significantly depends on our continued ability to execute our business strategy, continue to improve our existing products and design, develop, produce and market innovative new products. Product design, development, innovation and enhancement is often a complex, time-consuming and costly process involving significant investment in research and development, with no assurance of return on investment. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new and improved products in a timely or efficient manner or that new and improved products, if developed, will achieve market acceptance. Our products generally must conform to various evolving and sometimes 12competing industry standards, which may adversely affect our ability to compete in certain markets or require us to incur significant costs. In addition, our customers generally impose very high quality and reliability standards on our products, which often change and may be difficult or costly to satisfy. Any inability to satisfy customer quality and reliability standards or comply with industry standards and technical requirements may adversely affect demand for our products and our results of operations. In addition, our growth is dependent on our continued ability to identify and penetrate new markets where we have limited experience and competition is intense. Some of our customers in these markets are less established, which could subject us to increased credit risk. There can be no assurance that the markets we serve and/or target based on our business strategy will grow in the future, that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets, that our products, or the products in which our products are used, will achieve customer acceptance in these markets, that competitors will not force price reductions or take market share from us, or that we can achieve or maintain adequate gross margins or profits in these markets. Furthermore, a decline in demand in one or several of our end-user markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations.We may not be able to compete successfully in markets within the semiconductor industry in the future.We face intense technological and pricing competition in the semiconductor industry, and we expect this competition to increase in the future, including from companies located outside of the United States. Many companies have sufficient financial, manufacturing, technical, sales and marketing resources to develop and market products that compete with our products. Some of our competitors may have more advantageous supply or development relationships with our current and potential customers or suppliers. Our competitors also include emerging companies selling specialized products in markets we serve and entities outside of the U.S., including entities associated with efforts by foreign governments to create indigenous semiconductor industries.  Competition is generally based on design and quality of products, product performance, features and functionality, and product pricing, availability and capacity, with the relative importance of these factors varying among products, markets and customers. Existing or new competitors may develop products or technologies that more effectively address the demands of our customers and markets with enhanced performance, features and functionality, lower power requirements, greater levels of integration or lower cost. Increased competition in certain markets has resulted in and may continue to result in declining average selling prices, reduced gross margins and loss of market share in those markets. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors, or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased competition.  In addition, the semiconductor industry has experienced significant consolidation over the past several years.  Consolidation among our competitors could lead to a changing competitive landscape, which could negatively impact our competitive position and market share and harm our results of operations.We rely on third-party suppliers, subcontractors and manufacturers for some industry-standard wafers, manufacturing processes, assembly and test services, and transportation, and we generally cannot control their availability or conditions of supply.We rely, and plan to continue to rely, on suppliers, assembly and test subcontractors, freight carriers, and third-party wafer fabricators to supply most of our wafers that can be manufactured using industry-standard submicron processes. This reliance involves several risks, including reduced control over availability, capacity utilization, delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, and costs. We currently source approximately 60% of our wafer requirements annually from third-party wafer fabrication foundries, primarily Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC. In addition, these suppliers often provide manufacturing services to our competitors and therefore periods of increased industry demand may result in capacity constraints. In certain instances, the third-party supplier is the sole source of highly specialized processing services. If our suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver components to us on the time schedule and of the quality or quantity that we require or provide us with required manufacturing processes, we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers, which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers. If additional or replacement suppliers or manufacturing processes are not available, we may also experience delays in product development or shipment which could, in turn, result in the temporary or permanent loss of customers.The markets for semiconductor products are cyclical, and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices, and conversely, we may not be able to satisfy unexpected demand for our products.The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly. If we expand our operations and workforce too rapidly or procure excessive resources in anticipation of increased demand for our products, and that demand does not materialize at the pace at which we expect, or declines, or if we overbuild inventory in a period of decreased demand, our operating results may be adversely affected as a result of increased operating expenses, reduced margins, underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges. These capacity expansions by us and other semiconductor manufacturers could also lead to overcapacity in our target markets which could lead to price erosion that would adversely impact our operating results. Conversely, during periods of rapid increases in demand, our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy the demand. In addition, we may not be able to expand our workforce and 13operations in a sufficiently timely manner, procure adequate resources and raw materials, or locate suitable third-party suppliers, to respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products requested by our customers, and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected.Our semiconductor products are complex and we may be subject to product warranty and indemnity claims, which could result in significant costs and damage to our reputation and adversely affect the market acceptance of our products.Semiconductor products are highly complex and may contain defects when they are first introduced or as new versions are developed. We generally warrant our products to our customers for one year from the date title passes from us. We invest significant resources in the testing of our products; however, if any of our products contain defects, we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs, pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders. These problems may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or others, including liability for costs associated with product recalls, which may adversely impact our operating results. We may also be subject to customer indemnity claims. Our customers have on occasion been sued, and may be sued in the future, by third parties alleging infringement of intellectual property rights, or damages resulting from use of our products. Those customers may seek indemnification from us under the terms and conditions of our sales contracts with them. In certain cases, our potential indemnification liability may be significant. If any of our products contains defects, or has reliability, quality or compatibility problems, our reputation may be damaged, which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could also adversely affect our operating results.We have manufacturing processes that utilize a substantial amount of technology as the fabrication of integrated circuits is a highly complex and precise process. Minute impurities, contaminants in the manufacturing environment, difficulties in the fabrication process, defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process, manufacturing equipment failures, wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional. While we have significant expertise in semiconductor manufacturing, it is possible that some processes could become unstable. This instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.We are involved in frequent litigation, including claims regarding intellectual property rights, which could be costly to bring or defend and could require us to redesign products or pay significant royalties.The semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights, including claims arising under our contractual obligations to indemnify our customers. Other companies or individuals have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes, and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling infringing products, if those patents are found to be valid and infringed by us.  In the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property, and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement, and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel. We could also be subject to litigation or arbitration disputes arising under our contractual obligations, as well as indemnity, warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant costs and expenses as we defend those claims or pay damage awards. There can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities, and we may elect to self-insure with respect to certain matters. We may incur costs and expenses relating to a recall of our customers’ products due to an alleged failure of components we supply. An adverse outcome in litigation or arbitration could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or on our operating results or cash flows in the period in which the dispute is resolved.We may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary intellectual property rights, which may limit our ability to compete effectively.Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We primarily rely on patent, mask work, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietary technologies and processes. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain, copy, reverse engineer, use or disclose our technologies, products and processes. Moreover, the laws of foreign countries in which we design, manufacture, market and sell our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary intellectual property. There can be no assurance that the claims allowed in our issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. In addition, any of our existing or future patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. As such, any rights granted under these patents may not provide us with adequate protection. We may not be able to obtain foreign patents or 14pending applications corresponding to our U.S. patents and applications. Even if foreign patents are granted, effective enforcement in foreign countries may not be available. If our patents and mask works do not adequately protect our technology, our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours. Our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents.We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and strategic partners. We also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies, documentation and other proprietary information. Despite these efforts, internal or external parties may attempt to copy, disclose, obtain or use our products or technology without our authorization. Also, former employees may seek employment with our business partners, customers or competitors, and there can be no assurance that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment.A significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems could materially and adversely affect our business or reputation.  We rely on information technology systems throughout our Company to keep financial records and customer data, process orders, manage inventory, coordinate shipments to customers, maintain confidential and proprietary information, assist in semiconductor engineering and other technical activities and operate other critical functions such as internet connectivity, network communications and email.  Our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events.   If we were to experience a prolonged disruption in the information technology systems that involve our internal communications or our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business. We may also be subject to security breaches caused by computer viruses, illegal break-ins or hacking, sabotage, or acts of vandalism by third parties.  Our security measures or those of our third party service providers may not detect or prevent security breaches.  In addition, we provide our confidential and proprietary information to our strategic partners in certain cases where doing so is necessary to conduct our business.  While we employ confidentiality agreements to protect such information, nonetheless those third parties may also be subject to security breaches or otherwise compromise the protection of such information.  Security breaches of our information technology systems or those of our partners could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential and proprietary information belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage.If we do not retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our business strategy will be adversely affected.Our continued success depends to a significant extent upon the recruitment, retention and effective succession of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel, particularly our experienced engineers. The competition for these employees is intense. The loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, there could be a material adverse effect on our business should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel. We do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or employees.To remain competitive, we may need to invest in or acquire other companies, purchase or license technology from third parties, or enter into other strategic transactions in order to introduce new products or enhance our existing products.An element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisitions of businesses, assets, products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings, diversify our product portfolio, expand our market coverage, increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities. We may not be able to find businesses that have the technology or resources we need and, if we find such businesses, we may not be able to invest in, purchase or license the technology or resources on commercially favorable terms or at all. Acquisitions, investments and technology licenses are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons, including the cost of potential transactions, competition among prospective buyers and licensees, the need for regulatory approvals, and difficulties related to integration efforts. Both in the U.S. and abroad, governmental regulation of acquisitions, including antitrust reviews and approvals, has become more complex, increasing the costs and risks of undertaking and consummating significant acquisitions. In order to finance a potential transaction, we may need to raise additional funds by issuing securities or borrowing money. We may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms, and the sale of our stock may result in the dilution of our existing shareholders or the issuance of securities with rights that are superior to the rights of our common shareholders.Acquisitions also involve a number of risks, including:•difficulty or delay integrating acquired technologies, operations and personnel with our existing businesses;•diversion of management's attention in connection with both negotiating the transaction and integrating the assets;15•strain on managerial and operational resources as management tries to oversee larger or more complex operations;•the future funding requirements for acquired companies, which may be significant;•potential loss of key employees;•exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies; •higher than expected or unexpected costs relating to or associated with an acquisition;•difficulty realizing synergies and growth prospects of an acquisition in a timely manner or at all; and•increased risk of costly and time-consuming litigation.If we are unable to successfully address these risks, we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of the acquisition, which may have an adverse effect on our business strategy, plans and operating results.We rely on supplies, services and manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable areas, which could affect our ability to produce products.We, like many companies in the semiconductor industry, rely on supplies, services, internal manufacturing capacity, wafer fabrication foundries and other subcontractors in geologically unstable locations around the world. Earthquakes, tsunamis, flooding or other natural disasters may disrupt local semiconductor-related businesses and adversely affect manufacturing capacity, availability and cost of key raw materials, utilities and equipment, and availability of key services, including transport of our products worldwide.  Our insurance may not adequately cover losses resulting from such disruptions.  Any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities, or those of our subcontractors or third-party wafer fabrication foundries, as a result of fire, flood, natural disaster, unavailability of utilities or otherwise, could result in a temporary or permanent loss of customers for affected products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.We are exposed to business, economic, political, legal, regulatory and other risks through our significant worldwide operations, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We have significant operations and manufacturing facilities outside the United States, including in Ireland and the Philippines. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from customers in international markets, and we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the future.  Risks associated with our international business operations include the following:  •political, legal and economic changes or instability and civil unrest in foreign markets;•currency conversion risks and exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations;•limitations on the repatriation of earnings;•economic disruption from terrorism and threats of terrorism and the response to them by the U.S. and its allies;•increased managerial complexities, including different employment practices and labor issues;•greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting such rights;•complex and varying government regulations and legal standards, particularly with respect to price protection, competition practices, export control regulations, customs and tax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, data privacy, intellectual property, anti-corruption and environmental compliance, including U.S. customs and export regulations, including International Traffic in Arms Regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;•natural disasters or pandemics;•transportation disruptions and delays and increases in labor and transportation costs;•changes to foreign taxes, tariffs and freight rates;•trade and travel restrictions or government sanctions, including restrictions imposed by the U.S. government on trading with parties in foreign countries; •fluctuations in raw material costs and energy costs;•greater difficulty in accounts receivable collections and longer collection periods; and•costs associated with our foreign defined benefit pension plans.16Any of these risks, or any other risks related to international business operations, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Many of these risks are present in China.  While we expect to continue to expand our business and operations in China, our success in the Chinese markets may be adversely affected by China’s continuously evolving policies, laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, currency controls, antitrust,  the environment, indigenous innovation and the promotion of a domestic semiconductor industry, and intellectual property rights and enforcement and protection of those rights. Enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be inconsistent. In addition, changes in the political environment, governmental policies or U.S.-China relations could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, exposure of our proprietary intellectual property, increased taxation, and restrictions on imports, import duties or currency revaluations, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results.At October 31, 2015, our principal source of liquidity was $3.0 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, of which approximately $657.8 million was held in the United States and the remaining balance was held outside the United States in various foreign subsidiaries. As we intend to reinvest our foreign earnings indefinitely, this cash held outside the United States is not readily available to meet our cash requirements in the United States. We require a substantial amount of cash in the United States for operating requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends and acquisitions. If we are unable to address our U.S. cash requirements through operations, borrowings under our current credit facility, future debt or equity offerings or other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost, it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of earnings that are permanently reinvested, and we may be required to pay additional taxes under current tax laws, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Our operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors.A significant portion of our sales are through independent distributors that are not under our control. These independent distributors generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts applied to our products or they could terminate their representation of us. We generally do not require letters of credit from our distributors and are not protected against accounts receivable default or declarations of bankruptcy by these distributors. Our inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our operating results. Termination of a significant distributor or a group of distributors, whether at our initiative or the distributor’s initiative or through consolidation in the distribution industry, could disrupt our current business, and if we are unable to find suitable replacements, our operating results could be adversely affected.We are subject to environmental, health and safety (EHS) regulations, which could increase our expenses and affect our operating results.Our industry is subject to EHS requirements, particularly those environmental requirements that control and restrict the sourcing, use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage and disposal of certain chemicals, minerals, elements and materials used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process. Public attention to environmental, sustainability and social responsibility concerns continues to increase, and our customers routinely include stringent environmental and other standards in their contracts with us. Changes in EHS laws or regulations may require us to invest in costly equipment or alter the way our products are made and may adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products. In addition, we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability for damages caused by potential or actual releases of such materials. Any failure to control such materials adequately or to comply with existing or future EHS statutory or regulatory standards, requirements or contractual obligations could result in liability for damages and remediation; the imposition of regulatory penalties and civil and criminal fines; the suspension or termination of the development, manufacture, sale or use of certain of our products; changes to our manufacturing processes or a need to substitute materials that may cost more or be less available; damage to our reputation; and/or increased expenses associated with compliance, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.If we fail to comply with government contracting regulations, we could suffer a loss of revenue or incur price adjustments or other penalties.Some of our revenue is derived from contracts with agencies of the United States government and subcontracts with its prime contractors. As a United States government contractor or subcontractor, we are subject to federal contracting regulations, including the Federal Acquisition Regulations, which govern the allowability of costs incurred by us in the performance of United States government contracts. Certain contract pricing is based on estimated direct and indirect costs, which are subject to change. Additionally, the United States government is entitled after final payment on certain negotiated contracts to examine all of our cost records with respect to such contracts and to seek a downward adjustment to the price of the contract if it determines that we failed to furnish complete, accurate and current cost or pricing data in connection with the negotiation of the price of the contract.17In connection with our United States government business, we are also subject to government audits and to review and approval of our policies, procedures, and internal controls for compliance with procurement regulations and applicable laws. In certain circumstances, if we do not comply with the terms of a contract or with regulations or statutes, we could be subject to downward contract price adjustments or refund obligations or could in extreme circumstances be assessed civil and criminal penalties or be debarred or suspended from obtaining future contracts for a specified period of time. Any such suspension or debarment or other sanction could have an adverse effect on our business.Under some of our government subcontracts, we are required to maintain secure facilities and to obtain security clearances for personnel involved in performance of the contract, in compliance with applicable federal standards. If we were unable to comply with these requirements, or if personnel critical to our performance of these contracts were unable to obtain or maintain their security clearances, we might be unable to perform these contracts or compete for other projects of this nature, which could adversely affect our revenue.If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow, we may not be able to service our debt obligations, including making payments on our outstanding senior unsecured notes.In April 2011, we issued in a public offering $375.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.0% senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2016 (the 2016 Notes).  In June 2013, we issued in a public offering $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.875% senior unsecured notes due June 1, 2023 (the 2023 Notes and together with the 2016 Notes, the Notes).  Our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness when due depends upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our outstanding debt, we may be required to, among other things:•seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets;•refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness, including the Notes;•borrow under our existing revolving credit facility;•divert funds that would otherwise be invested in our operations;•repatriate earnings at higher tax rates that are permanently reinvested in foreign locations;•sell selected assets; or•reduce or delay planned capital expenditures or operating expenditures.Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt, including the Notes, which could negatively impact our financial results. In addition, any such financing, refinancing or sale of assets might not be possible on economically favorable terms.Restrictions in our revolving credit facility and outstanding debt instruments may limit our activities.Our current revolving credit facility and the Notes impose, and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may impose, restrictions that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our Company, including to undertake certain transactions, to create certain liens on our assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness. Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, changes in technology and changes in the level of competition. In addition, our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. If we breach any of the covenants under our revolving credit facility or the indentures governing the Notes and do not obtain appropriate waivers, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness thereunder could be declared immediately due and payable or we may be restricted from further borrowing under our revolving credit facility.Our stock price may be volatile.The market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future, as it may be significantly affected by factors including:•global economic conditions generally;•crises in global credit, debt and financial markets;•actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and operating results;18•changes in financial estimates or other statements made by securities analysts or others in analyst reports or other publications or our failure to perform in line with those estimates or statements or our published guidance;•changes in market valuations of other semiconductor companies;•rumors and speculation in the press, investment community or on social media about us or other companies in our industry;•announcements by us or our competitors of significant new products, technical innovations, material transactions, acquisitions or dispositions, litigation, capital commitments or revised earnings estimates;•departures of key personnel;•alleged noncompliance with laws, regulations or ethics standards by us or any of our employees, officers or directors; and•negative media publicity targeting us or our suppliers, customers or competitors.The stock market has historically experienced volatility, especially within the semiconductor industry, that often has been unrelated to the performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless of our operating results.Our directors and executive officers periodically sell shares of our common stock in the market, including pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans.  Regardless of the individual's reasons for such sales, securities analysts and investors could view such sales as a negative indicator and our stock price could be adversely affected as a result"
8,ADI,ANALOG DEVICES,2014-12-10,"ITEM 1A.     RISK FACTORSSet forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the SEC are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report.Disruptions in global credit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.There is significant continuing uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets. These economic uncertainties may lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending, which may cause our customers to cancel, decrease or delay their existing and future orders for our products and make it difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities.  Significant disruption to global credit and financial markets may also adversely affect our ability to access external financing sources on acceptable terms.  Financial difficulties experienced by our customers could result in nonpayment or payment delays for previously purchased products, thereby increasing our credit risk exposure.  Uncertainty regarding the future stability of the global credit and financial markets could cause the value of the currency in the affected markets to deteriorate, thus reducing the purchasing power of those customers. In addition, financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or distributors could result in product delays, increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges. During the past few years, many governments adopted stimulus or spending programs designed to ease the economic impact of the crisis. Some of our businesses benefited from these stimulus programs but there can be no assurance that such programs will continue in the future. If economic conditions deteriorate, we may record additional charges relating to restructuring costs or the impairment of assets and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.Our future revenue, gross margins, operating results and net income are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate.      Our future revenue, gross margins, operating results and net income are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors, including:•the effects of adverse economic conditions in the markets in which we sell our products;•changes in customer demand for our products and for end products that incorporate our products;•our ability to effectively manage our cost structure in both the short term and over a longer duration;•the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us, our customers or our competitors;•competitive pricing pressures;•fluctuations in manufacturing yields, adequate availability of wafers and other raw materials, and manufacturing, assembly and test capacity;•the ability of our third-party suppliers, subcontractors and manufacturers to supply us with sufficient quantities of raw materials, products and/or components;•a decline in the U.S. Government defense budget, changes in spending or budgetary priorities, a prolonged U.S. Government shutdown or delays in contract awards;•a decline in infrastructure spending by foreign governments, including China;•any significant decline in our backlog;•the timing, delay, reduction or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability to manage inventory;•our ability to recruit, hire, retain and motivate adequate numbers of engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of our customers;•the increasing costs of providing employee benefits, including health insurance, pension plan contributions and retirement benefits;  •changes in geographic, product or customer mix;•our ability to utilize our manufacturing facilities at efficient levels;•potential significant litigation-related costs or product warranty and/or indemnity claims, including those not covered by our suppliers or insurers;•the difficulties inherent in forecasting future operating expense levels, including with respect to costs associated with labor, utilities, transportation and raw materials;11•the costs related to compliance with increasing worldwide government, environmental and social responsibility regulations;•changes in our effective tax rates in the United States, Ireland or worldwide; and•the effects of public health emergencies, natural disasters, widespread travel disruptions, security risks, terrorist activities, international conflicts and other events beyond our control.In addition, the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic upturns and downturns. Our business is also subject to rapid technological changes and there can be no assurance (i) that products stocked in our inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them, or (ii) that we will be able to design, develop and produce products in a timely fashion to accommodate changing customer demand. As a result of these and other factors, there can be no assurance that we will not experience material fluctuations in future revenue, gross margins, operating results and net income on a quarterly or annual basis.  Our historical financial performance and results of operations should not be relied upon as indicators of future performance or results.  In addition, if our revenue, gross margins, operating results and net income do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the market price of our common stock may decline.Increases in our effective tax rate and exposure to additional tax liabilities may adversely impact our results of operations.Our effective tax rate reflects the applicable tax rate in effect in the various tax jurisdictions around the world where our income is earned.  Our effective tax rate in 2014 was below the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35%, primarily due to lower statutory tax rates applicable to our operations in the foreign jurisdictions in which we earn income.  A number of factors may increase our future effective tax rate, including: new or revised tax laws or legislation (including proposed revisions to Irish tax laws), or the interpretation of such laws or legislation by governmental authorities; increases in tax rates in various jurisdictions; variation in the mix of jurisdictions in which our profits are earned and taxed; repatriation of non-U.S. earnings; any adverse resolution of ongoing tax audits or adverse rulings from taxing authorities worldwide; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including executive compensation subject to the limitations of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code and amortization of assets acquired in connection with strategic transactions; decreased availability of tax deductions for stock-based compensation awards worldwide; and changes in available tax credits. Any significant increase in our future effective tax rate could adversely impact our net income during future periods.Long-term contracts are not typical for us, some contracts may be terminated for convenience of the customer, and incorrect forecasts or reductions, cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results.We typically do not have long-term sales contracts with our customers. In certain markets where end-user demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict, some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment, even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all, or even any, of the product. In other instances, we manufacture product based on forecasts of customer demands. Additionally, our U.S. Government contracts and subcontracts may be funded in increments over a number of government budget periods and typically can be terminated by the government for its convenience.  As a result, we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales, and we are subject to the risk of lower than expected orders or cancellations of orders, leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog. Further, orders or forecasts for products that meet the customer’s unique requirements and that are canceled or unrealized orders would, in addition, result in an inventory of unsaleable products, causing potential inventory write-offs, and we may be unable to recover all of our costs incurred or committed. As a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the products that are subject to these uncertainties, the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial. Incorrect forecasts, or reductions, cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results.Our future success depends upon our ability to execute our business strategy, continue to innovate, improve our existing products, design, develop, produce and market new products, and identify and enter new markets.Our future success significantly depends on our continued ability to execute our business strategy, continue to improve our existing products and design, develop, produce and market innovative new products. Product design, development, innovation and enhancement is often a complex, time-consuming and costly process involving significant investment in research and development, with no assurance of return on investment. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new and improved products in a timely or efficient manner or that new and improved products, if developed, will achieve market acceptance. Our products generally must conform to various evolving and sometimes competing industry standards, which may adversely affect our ability to compete in certain markets or require us to incur significant costs. In addition, our customers generally impose very high quality and reliability standards on our products, which 12often change and may be difficult or costly to satisfy. Any inability to satisfy customer quality and reliability standards or comply with industry standards and technical requirements may adversely affect demand for our products and our results of operations. In addition, our growth is dependent on our continued ability to identify and penetrate new markets where we have limited experience and competition is intense. Some of our customers in these markets are less established, which could subject us to increased credit risk. There can be no assurance that the markets we serve and/or target based on our business strategy will grow in the future, that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets, that our products will achieve customer acceptance in these markets, that competitors will not force price reductions or take market share from us, or that we can achieve or maintain adequate gross margins or profits in these markets. Furthermore, a decline in demand in one or several of our end-user markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations.We may not be able to compete successfully in markets within the semiconductor industry in the future.We face intense technological and pricing competition in the semiconductor industry, and we expect this competition to increase in the future, including from companies located outside the United States. Many companies have sufficient financial, manufacturing, technical, sales and marketing resources to develop and market products that compete with our products. Some of our competitors may have more advantageous supply or development relationships with our current and potential customers or suppliers. Our competitors also include emerging companies selling specialized products in markets we serve and entities outside of the U.S.  Competition is generally based on design and quality of products, product performance, features and functionality, and product pricing, availability and capacity, with the relative importance of these factors varying among products, markets and customers. Existing or new competitors may develop products or technologies that more effectively address the demands of our customers and markets with enhanced performance, features and functionality, lower power requirements, greater levels of integration or lower cost. Increased competition in certain markets has resulted in and may continue to result in declining average selling prices, reduced gross margins and loss of market share in those markets. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors, or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased competition.We rely on third-party suppliers, subcontractors and manufacturers for some industry-standard wafers, manufacturing processes, assembly and test services, and transportation, and we generally cannot control their availability or conditions of supply.We rely, and plan to continue to rely, on suppliers, assembly and test subcontractors, freight carriers, and third-party wafer fabricators to supply most of our wafers that can be manufactured using industry-standard submicron processes. This reliance involves several risks, including reduced control over availability, capacity utilization, delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, and costs. We currently source approximately 50% of our wafer requirements annually from third-party wafer fabrication foundries, primarily Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC. In addition, these suppliers often provide manufacturing services to our competitors and therefore periods of increased industry demand may result in capacity constraints. In certain instances, the third-party supplier is the sole source of highly specialized processing services. Additionally, our recently acquired Hittite business utilizes foundries that provide the advanced gallium arsenide, or GaAs, processes that currently account for most of its wafer purchases.  The number of foundries that can provide the GaAs process is limited, and Hittite is currently in the process of transitioning away from one of its principal GaAs foundries.  If our suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver components to us on the time schedule and of the quality or quantity that we require or provide us with required manufacturing processes, we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers, which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers. If additional or replacement suppliers or manufacturing processes are not available, we may also experience delays in product development or shipment which could, in turn, result in the temporary or permanent loss of customers.The markets for semiconductor products are cyclical, and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices, and conversely, we may not be able to satisfy unexpected demand for our products.The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly. If we expand our operations and workforce too rapidly or procure excessive resources in anticipation of increased demand for our products, and that demand does not materialize at the pace at which we expect, or declines, or if we overbuild inventory in a period of decreased demand, our operating results may be adversely affected as a result of increased operating expenses, reduced margins, underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges. These capacity expansions by us and other semiconductor manufacturers could also lead to overcapacity in our target markets which could lead to price erosion that would adversely impact our operating results. Conversely, during periods of rapid increases in demand, our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy the demand. In addition, we may not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner, procure adequate resources and raw materials, or locate suitable third-party suppliers, to respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products requested by our customers, and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected.13Our semiconductor products are complex and we may be subject to product warranty and indemnity claims, which could result in significant costs and damage to our reputation and adversely affect the market acceptance of our products.Semiconductor products are highly complex and may contain defects when they are first introduced or as new versions are developed. We generally warrant our products to our customers for one year from the date title passes from us. We invest significant resources in the testing of our products; however, if any of our products contain defects, we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs, pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders. These problems may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or others, including liability for costs associated with product recalls, which may adversely impact our operating results. We may also be subject to customer indemnity claims. Our customers have on occasion been sued, and may be sued in the future, by third parties alleging infringement of intellectual property rights, or damages resulting from use of our products. Those customers may seek indemnification from us under the terms and conditions of our sales contracts with them. In certain cases, our potential indemnification liability may be significant. If any of our products contains defects, or has reliability, quality or compatibility problems, our reputation may be damaged, which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could also adversely affect our operating results.We have manufacturing processes that utilize a substantial amount of technology as the fabrication of integrated circuits is a highly complex and precise process. Minute impurities, contaminants in the manufacturing environment, difficulties in the fabrication process, defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process, manufacturing equipment failures, wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional. While we have significant expertise in semiconductor manufacturing, it is possible that some processes could become unstable. This instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.We are involved in frequent litigation, including claims regarding intellectual property rights, which could be costly to bring or defend and could require us to redesign products or pay significant royalties.The semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights, including claims arising under our contractual obligations to indemnify our customers. Other companies or individuals have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes, and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling infringing products, if those patents are found to be valid and infringed by us.  In the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property, and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement, and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel. We could also be subject to litigation or arbitration disputes arising under our contractual obligations, as well as indemnity, warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant costs and expenses as we defend those claims or pay damage awards. There can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities. We may incur costs and expenses relating to a recall of our customers’ products due to an alleged failure of components we supply. An adverse outcome in litigation or arbitration could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or on our operating results or cash flows in the period in which the dispute is resolved.We may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary intellectual property rights, which may limit our ability to compete effectively.Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We primarily rely on patent, mask work, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietary technologies and processes. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain, copy, reverse engineer, use or disclose our technologies, products and processes. Moreover, the laws of foreign countries in which we design, manufacture, market and sell our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary intellectual property. There can be no assurance that the claims allowed in our issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. In addition, any of our existing or future patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. As such, any rights granted under these patents may not provide us with adequate protection. We may not be able to obtain foreign patents or pending applications corresponding to our U.S. patents and applications. Even if foreign patents are granted, effective enforcement in foreign countries may not be available. If our patents and mask works do not adequately protect our technology, our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours. Our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents.14We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and strategic partners. We also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies, documentation and other proprietary information. Despite these efforts, internal or external parties may attempt to copy, disclose, obtain or use our products or technology without our authorization. Also, former employees may seek employment with our business partners, customers or competitors, and there can be no assurance that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment.A significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems could materially and adversely affect our business or reputation.  We rely on information technology systems throughout our Company to keep financial records and customer data, process orders, manage inventory, coordinate shipments to customers, maintain confidential and proprietary information, assist in semiconductor engineering and other technical activities and operate other critical functions such as internet connectivity, network communications and email.  Our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events.   If we were to experience a prolonged disruption in the information technology systems that involve our internal communications or our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business. We may also be subject to security breaches caused by computer viruses, illegal break-ins or hacking, sabotage, or acts of vandalism by third parties.  Our security measures or those of our third party service providers may not detect or prevent security breaches.  In addition, we provide our confidential and proprietary information to our third-party business partners in certain cases where doing so is necessary to conduct our business.  While we employ confidentiality agreements to protect such information, nonetheless those third parties may also be subject to security breaches or otherwise compromise the protection of such information.  Security breaches of our information technology systems or those of our partners could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential and proprietary information belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage.If we do not retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our business strategy will be adversely affected.Our continued success depends to a significant extent upon the recruitment, retention and effective succession of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel, particularly our experienced engineers. The competition for these employees is intense. The loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, there could be a material adverse effect on our business should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel. We do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or employees.To remain competitive, we may need to invest in or acquire other companies, purchase or license technology from third parties, or enter into other strategic transactions in order to introduce new products or enhance our existing products.An element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisitions of businesses, assets, products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings, diversify our product portfolio, expand our market coverage, increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities. We may not be able to find businesses that have the technology or resources we need and, if we find such businesses, we may not be able to invest in, purchase or license the technology or resources on commercially favorable terms or at all. Acquisitions, investments and technology licenses are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons, including the cost of potential transactions, competition among prospective buyers and licensees, the need for regulatory approvals, and difficulties related to integration efforts. Both in the U.S. and abroad, governmental regulation of acquisitions has become more complex, increasing the costs and risks of undertaking significant acquisitions. In order to finance a potential transaction, we may need to raise additional funds by issuing securities or borrowing money. We may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms, and the sale of our stock may result in the dilution of our existing shareholders or the issuance of securities with rights that are superior to the rights of our common shareholders.Acquisitions also involve a number of risks, including:•difficulty or delay integrating acquired technologies, operations and personnel with our existing businesses;•diversion of management's attention in connection with both negotiating the transaction and integrating the assets;•strain on managerial and operational resources as management tries to oversee larger or more complex operations;•the future funding requirements for acquired companies, which may be significant;•potential loss of key employees;•exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies; 15•higher than expected or unexpected costs relating to or associated with an acquisition;•difficulty realizing synergies and growth prospects of an acquisition in a timely manner or at all; and•increased risk of costly and time-consuming litigation.If we are unable to successfully address these risks, we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of the acquisition, which may have an adverse effect on our business strategy, plans and operating results.We rely on supplies, services and manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable areas, which could affect our ability to produce products.We, like many companies in the semiconductor industry, rely on supplies, services, internal manufacturing capacity, wafer fabrication foundries and other subcontractors in geologically unstable locations around the world. Earthquakes, tsunamis, flooding or other natural disasters may disrupt local semiconductor-related businesses and adversely affect manufacturing capacity, availability and cost of key raw materials, utilities and equipment, and availability of key services, including transport of our products worldwide.  Our insurance may not adequately cover losses resulting from such disruptions.  Any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities, or those of our subcontractors or third-party wafer fabrication foundries, as a result of fire, flood, natural disaster, unavailability of utilities or otherwise, could result in a temporary or permanent loss of customers for affected products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.We are exposed to business, economic, political, legal, regulatory and other risks through our significant worldwide operations, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.We have significant operations and manufacturing facilities outside the United States, including in Ireland and the Philippines. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from customers in international markets, and we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue in the future.  Risks associated with our international business operations include the following:  •political, legal and economic changes or instability and civil unrest in foreign markets;•currency conversion risks and exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations;•limitations on the repatriation of earnings;•economic disruption from terrorism and threats of terrorism and the response to them by the U.S. and its allies;•increased managerial complexities, including different employment practices and labor issues;•greater difficulty enforcing intellectual property rights and weaker laws protecting such rights;•complex and varying government regulations and legal standards, particularly with respect to price protection, competition practices, export control regulations, customs and tax requirements, anti-boycott regulations, data privacy, intellectual property, anti-corruption and environmental compliance, including U.S. customs and export regulations, including International Traffic in Arms Regulations and the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;•natural disasters or pandemics;•transportation disruptions and delays and increases in labor and transportation costs;•changes to foreign taxes, tariffs and freight rates;•trade and travel restrictions, including restrictions imposed by the U.S. government on trading with parties in foreign countries; •fluctuations in raw material costs and energy costs;•greater difficulty in accounts receivable collections and longer collection periods; and•costs associated with our foreign defined benefit pension plans.Any of these risks, or any other risks related to international business operations, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.     Many of these risks are present in China.  While we expect to continue to expand our business and operations in China, our success in the Chinese markets may be adversely affected by China’s continuously evolving laws and regulations, 16including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, currency controls, the environment, indigenous innovation, and intellectual property rights and enforcement and protection of those rights. Enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be inconsistent. In addition, changes in the political environment, governmental policies or U.S.-China relations could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, exposure of our proprietary intellectual property, increased taxation, and restrictions on imports, import duties or currency revaluations, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results.At November 1, 2014, our principal source of liquidity was $2.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, of which approximately $856.5 million was held in the United States and the remaining balance was held outside the United States in various foreign subsidiaries. As we intend to reinvest our foreign earnings indefinitely, this cash held outside the United States is not readily available to meet our cash requirements in the United States. We require a substantial amount of cash in the United States for operating requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends and acquisitions. If we are unable to address our U.S. cash requirements through operations, through borrowings under our current credit facility, through future debt or equity offerings or from other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost, it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of earnings that are permanently reinvested, and we may be required to pay additional taxes under current tax laws, which could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition.Our operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors.A significant portion of our sales are through independent distributors that are not under our control. These independent distributors generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts applied to our products or they could terminate their representation of us. We generally do not require letters of credit from our distributors and are not protected against accounts receivable default or declarations of bankruptcy by these distributors. Our inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our operating results. Termination of a significant distributor or a group of distributors, whether at our initiative or the distributor’s initiative or through consolidation in the distribution industry, could disrupt our current business, and if we are unable to find suitable replacements, our operating results could be adversely affected.We are subject to environmental, health and safety (EHS) regulations, which could increase our expenses and affect our operating results.Our industry is subject to EHS requirements, particularly those environmental requirements that control and restrict the sourcing, use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage and disposal of certain chemicals, minerals, elements and materials used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process. Public attention to environmental, sustainability and social responsibility concerns continues to increase, and our customers routinely include stringent environmental and other standards in their contracts with us. Changes in EHS laws or regulations may require us to invest in costly equipment or alter the way our products are made and may adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products. In addition, we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability for damages caused by potential or actual releases of such materials. Any failure to control such materials adequately or to comply with existing or future EHS statutory or regulatory standards, requirements or contractual obligations could result in liability for damages and remediation; the imposition of regulatory penalties and civil and criminal fines; the suspension or termination of the development, manufacture, sale or use of certain of our products; changes to our manufacturing processes or a need to substitute materials that may cost more or be less available; damage to our reputation; and/or increased expenses associated with compliance, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.If we fail to comply with government contracting regulations, we could suffer a loss of revenue or incur price adjustments or other penalties.Some of our revenue is derived from contracts with agencies of the United States government and subcontracts with its prime contractors. As a United States government contractor or subcontractor, we are subject to federal contracting regulations, including the Federal Acquisition Regulations, which govern the allowability of costs incurred by us in the performance of United States government contracts. Certain contract pricing is based on estimated direct and indirect costs, which are subject to change. Additionally, the United States government is entitled after final payment on certain negotiated contracts to examine all of our cost records with respect to such contracts and to seek a downward adjustment to the price of the contract if it determines that we failed to furnish complete, accurate and current cost or pricing data in connection with the negotiation of the price of the contract. In connection with our United States government business, we are also subject to government audits and to review and approval of our policies, procedures, and internal controls for compliance with procurement regulations and applicable laws. In certain circumstances, if we do not comply with the terms of a contract or with regulations or statutes, we could be subject to downward contract price adjustments or refund obligations or could in extreme circumstances be assessed civil and criminal 17penalties or be debarred or suspended from obtaining future contracts for a specified period of time. Any such suspension or debarment or other sanction could have an adverse effect on our business. Under some of our government subcontracts, we are required to maintain secure facilities and to obtain security clearances for personnel involved in performance of the contract, in compliance with applicable federal standards. If we were unable to comply with these requirements, or if personnel critical to our performance of these contracts were unable to obtain or maintain their security clearances, we might be unable to perform these contracts or compete for other projects of this nature, which could adversely affect our revenue.If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow, we may not be able to service our debt obligations, including making payments on our outstanding senior unsecured notes.In April 2011, we issued in a public offering $375.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.0% senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2016 (the 2016 Notes).  In June 2013, we issued in a public offering $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.875% senior unsecured notes due June 1, 2023 (the 2023 Notes and together with the 2016 Notes, the Notes).  Our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness when due depends upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our outstanding debt, we may be required to, among other things:•seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets;•refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness, including the Notes;•borrow under our existing revolving credit facility;•divert funds that would otherwise be invested in our operations;•repatriate earnings at higher tax rates that are permanently reinvested in foreign locations;•sell selected assets; or•reduce or delay planned capital expenditures or operating expenditures.Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt, including the Notes, which could negatively impact our financial results. In addition, any such financing, refinancing or sale of assets might not be possible on economically favorable terms.Restrictions in our revolving credit facility and outstanding debt instruments may limit our activities.Our current revolving credit facility and our outstanding senior unsecured notes impose, and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may impose, restrictions that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our Company, including to undertake certain transactions, to create certain liens on our assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness. Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, changes in technology and changes in the level of competition. In addition, our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. If we breach any of the covenants under our revolving credit facility or the indenture governing our outstanding notes and do not obtain appropriate waivers, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness thereunder could be declared immediately due and payable or we may be restricted from further borrowing under our revolving credit facility.Our stock price may be volatile.The market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future, as it may be significantly affected by factors including:•global economic conditions generally;•crises in global credit, debt and financial markets;•actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and operating results;•changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or our failure to perform in line with those estimates or our published guidance;•changes in market valuations of other semiconductor companies;18•announcements by us or our competitors of significant new products, technical innovations, material transactions, acquisitions or dispositions, litigation or capital commitments;•departures of key personnel;•alleged noncompliance with laws, regulations or ethics standards by us or any of our employees, officers or directors; and•negative media publicity targeting us or our suppliers, customers or competitors.The stock market has historically experienced volatility, especially within the semiconductor industry, that often has been unrelated to the performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless of our operating results.Our directors and executive officers periodically sell shares of our common stock in the market, including pursuant to Rule 10b5-1 trading plans.  Regardless of the individual's reasons for such sales, securities analysts and investors could view such sales as a negative indicator and our stock price could be adversely affected as a result"
16,ADI,ANALOG DEVICES,2013-11-26,"ITEM 1A.     RISK FACTORSSet forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the SEC are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report.Disruptions in global credit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.There is significant continuing uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets. These economic uncertainties may lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending, which may cause our customers to cancel, decrease or delay their existing and future orders for our products and make it difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. Uncertainty regarding the future stability of the Euro Zone could cause the value of the Euro to deteriorate, thus reducing the purchasing power of our European customers. In addition, financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or distributors could result in product delays, increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges. During the past few years, many governments adopted stimulus or spending programs designed to ease the economic impact of the crisis. Some of our businesses benefited from these stimulus programs and there can be no assurance that such programs will continue in the future. If economic conditions deteriorate, we may record additional charges relating to restructuring costs or the impairment of assets and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.Our future revenue, gross margins, operating results and net income are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate.      Our future revenue, gross margins, operating results and net income are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors, including:•the effects of adverse economic conditions in the markets in which we sell our products;•changes in customer demand for our products and for end products that incorporate our products;•our ability to effectively manage our cost structure in both the short term and over a longer duration;•the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us, our customers or our competitors;•competitive pricing pressures;•fluctuations in manufacturing yields, adequate availability of wafers and other raw materials, and manufacturing, assembly and test capacity;•the ability of our third-party suppliers, subcontractors and manufacturers to supply us with sufficient quantities of raw materials, products and/or components;•any significant decline in our backlog;•the timing, delay or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability to manage inventory;•our ability to hire, retain and motivate adequate numbers of engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of our customers;•changes in geographic, product or customer mix;•our ability to utilize our manufacturing facilities at efficient levels;•potential significant litigation-related costs;•the difficulties inherent in forecasting future operating expense levels, including with respect to costs associated with labor, utilities, transportation and raw materials;•the costs related to compliance with increasing worldwide environmental and social responsibility regulations;•changes in our effective tax rates in the United States, Ireland or worldwide; and•the effects of public health emergencies, natural disasters, widespread travel disruptions, security risks, terrorist activities, international conflicts and other events beyond our control.In addition, the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic upturns and downturns. Our business is subject to rapid technological changes and there can be no assurance (i) that products stocked in our inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them, or (ii) that we will be able to produce products in a timely fashion to accommodate changing customer demand. As a result of these and other factors, there can be no assurance that we will not 11experience material fluctuations in future revenue, gross margins, operating results and net income on a quarterly or annual basis. In addition, if our revenue, gross margins, operating results and net income do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the market price of our common stock may decline.Changes in our effective tax rate may impact our results of operations.A number of factors may increase our future effective tax rate, including: changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws; increases in tax rates in various jurisdictions; variation in the jurisdictions in which profits are earned and taxed; any adverse resolution of ongoing tax audits or adverse rulings from taxing authorities worldwide; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including executive compensation subject to the limitations of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code and amortization of assets acquired in connection with strategic transactions; decreased availability of tax deductions for stock-based compensation awards worldwide; and changes in available tax credits. Any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact our net income during future periods.Long-term contracts are not typical for us and reductions, cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results.We typically do not have long-term sales contracts with our customers. In certain markets where end-user demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict, some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment, even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all, or even any, of the product. In other instances, we manufacture product based on forecasts of customer demands. As a result, we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and are subject to the risk of cancellations of orders, leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog. Further, orders or forecasts may be for products that meet the customer’s unique requirements so that those canceled or unrealized orders would, in addition, result in an inventory of unsaleable products, causing potential inventory write-offs. As a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the products that are subject to these uncertainties, the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial. Incorrect forecasts, or reductions, cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results.Our future success depends upon our ability to continue to innovate, improve our products, develop and market new products, and identify and enter new markets.Our future success significantly depends on our continued ability to improve our products and develop and market innovative new products. Product development, innovation and enhancement is often a complex, time-consuming and costly process involving significant investment in research and development, with no assurance of return on investment. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new and improved products in a timely or efficient manner or that new and improved products, if developed, will achieve market acceptance. Our products generally must conform to various evolving and sometimes competing industry standards, which may adversely affect our ability to compete in certain markets or require us to incur significant costs. In addition, our customers generally impose very high quality and reliability standards on our products, which often change and may be difficult or costly to satisfy. Any inability to satisfy customer quality standards or comply with industry standards and technical requirements may adversely affect demand for our products and our results of operations. In addition, our growth is dependent on our continued ability to identify and penetrate new markets where we have limited experience and competition is intense. Also, some of our customers in these markets are less established, which could subject us to increased credit risk. There can be no assurance that the markets we serve will grow in the future, that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets, that our products will achieve customer acceptance in these markets, that competitors will not force price reductions or take market share from us, or that we can achieve or maintain adequate gross margins or profits in these markets. Furthermore, a decline in demand in one or several of our end-user markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations.We may not be able to compete successfully in markets within the semiconductor industry in the future.We face intense technological and pricing competition in the semiconductor industry, and we expect this competition to increase in the future, including from companies located outside the United States. Many companies have sufficient financial, manufacturing, technical, sales and marketing resources to develop and market products that compete with our products. Some of our competitors may have more advantageous supply or development relationships with our current and potential customers or suppliers. Our competitors also include emerging companies selling specialized products in markets we serve.Competition is generally based on design and quality of products, product performance, features and functionality, and product pricing, availability and capacity, with the relative importance of these factors varying among products, markets and customers. Existing or new competitors may develop products or technologies that more effectively address the demands of our customers and markets with enhanced performance, features and functionality, lower power requirements, greater levels of integration or 12lower cost. Increased competition in certain markets has resulted in and may continue to result in declining average selling prices, reduced gross margins and loss of market share in those markets. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors, or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased competition.We rely on third-party suppliers, subcontractors and manufacturers for some industry-standard wafers, manufacturing processes and assembly and test services, and generally cannot control their availability or conditions of supply.We rely, and plan to continue to rely, on suppliers, assembly and test subcontractors, and third-party wafer fabricators to supply most of our wafers that can be manufactured using industry-standard submicron processes. This reliance involves several risks, including reduced control over availability, capacity utilization, delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, and costs. We currently source approximately 50% of our wafer requirements annually from third-party wafer fabrication foundries, primarily Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC. In addition, these suppliers often provide manufacturing services to our competitors and therefore periods of increased industry demand may result in capacity constraints. In certain instances, the third-party supplier is the sole source of highly specialized processing services. If our suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver components to us on the time schedule and of the quality or quantity that we require or provide us with required manufacturing processes, we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers, which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers. If replacement suppliers or manufacturing processes are not available, we may also experience delays in product development or shipment which could, in turn, result in the temporary or permanent loss of customers.The markets for semiconductor products are cyclical, and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices, and conversely, we may not be able to satisfy unexpected demand for our products.The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly. If we expand our operations and workforce too rapidly or procure excessive resources in anticipation of increased demand for our products, and that demand does not materialize at the pace at which we expect, or declines, or if we overbuild inventory in a period of decreased demand, our operating results may be adversely affected as a result of increased operating expenses, reduced margins, underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges. These capacity expansions by us and other semiconductor manufacturers could also lead to overcapacity in our target markets which could lead to price erosion that would adversely impact our operating results. Conversely, during periods of rapid increases in demand, our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy the demand. In addition, we may not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner, procure adequate resources and raw materials, or locate suitable third-party suppliers, to respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products requested by our customers, and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected.Our semiconductor products are complex and we may be subject to product warranty and indemnity claims, which could result in significant costs and damage to our reputation and adversely affect the market acceptance of our products.Semiconductor products are highly complex and may contain defects when they are first introduced or as new versions are developed. We generally warrant our products to our customers for one year from the date title passes from us. We invest significant resources in the testing of our products; however, if any of our products contain defects, we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs, pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders. These problems may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or others, including liability for costs associated with product recalls, which may adversely impact our operating results. We may also be subject to customer indemnity claims. Our customers have on occasion been sued, and may in the future be sued, by third parties alleging infringement of intellectual property rights, or damages resulting from use of our products. Those customers may seek indemnification from us under the terms and conditions of our sales contracts with them. In certain cases, our potential indemnification liability may be significant. If any of our products contains defects, or has reliability, quality or compatibility problems, our reputation may be damaged, which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could adversely affect our operating results.We have manufacturing processes that utilize a substantial amount of technology as the fabrication of integrated circuits is a highly complex and precise process. Minute impurities, contaminants in the manufacturing environment, difficulties in the fabrication process, defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process, manufacturing equipment failures, wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional. While we have significant expertise in semiconductor manufacturing, it is possible that some processes could become unstable. This instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.13We are involved in frequent litigation, including regarding intellectual property rights, which could be costly to bring or defend and could require us to redesign products or pay significant royalties.The semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights, including claims arising under our contractual obligations to indemnify our customers. Other companies or individuals have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes, and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling infringing products, if those patents are found to be valid and infringed by us.  In the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property, and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement, and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel. We could be subject to indemnity, warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant costs and expenses as we defend those claims or pay damage awards. There can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities. We may incur costs and expenses relating to a recall of our customers’ products due to an alleged failure of components we supply. An adverse outcome in litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or on our operating results or cash flows in the period in which the litigation is resolved.We may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary intellectual property rights, which may limit our ability to compete effectively.Our future success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We primarily rely on patent, mask work, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietary technologies and processes. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain, copy, use or disclose our technologies, products and processes. Moreover, the laws of foreign countries in which we design, manufacture, market and sell our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary intellectual property. There can be no assurance that the claims allowed in our issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. In addition, any of our existing or future patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. As such, any rights granted under these patents may not provide us with adequate protection. We may not be able to obtain foreign patents or pending applications corresponding to our U.S. patents and applications. Even if foreign patents are granted, effective enforcement in foreign countries may not be available. If our patents and mask works do not adequately protect our technology, our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours. Our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents.We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and strategic partners. We also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies, documentation and other proprietary information. Despite these efforts, internal or external parties may attempt to copy, disclose, obtain or use our products or technology without our authorization. Also, former employees may seek employment with our business partners, customers or competitors, and there can be no assurance that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment.A significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems could materially and adversely affect our business or reputation.  We rely on information technology systems throughout our Company to keep financial records, process orders, manage inventory, coordinate shipments to customers, and operate other critical functions.  Our information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events.   We may also be subject to security breaches caused by computer viruses, illegal break-ins or hacking, sabotage, or acts of vandalism by third parties.  Our security measures or those of our third party service providers may not detect or prevent security breaches.  If we were to experience a prolonged disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers or suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, security breaches of our information technology systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage.14If we do not retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our business strategy will be adversely affected.Our continued success depends to a significant extent upon the recruitment, retention and effective succession of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel, particularly our experienced engineers. The competition for these employees is intense. The loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, there could be a material adverse effect on our business should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel. We do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or employees.To remain competitive, we may need to acquire other companies, purchase or license technology from third parties, or enter into other strategic transactions in order to introduce new products or enhance our existing products.An element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisitions of businesses, assets, products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings, expand our market coverage, increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities. We may not be able to find businesses that have the technology or resources we need and, if we find such businesses, we may not be able to purchase or license the technology or resources on commercially favorable terms or at all. Acquisitions and technology licenses are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons, including the cost of potential transactions, competition among prospective buyers and licensees, the need for regulatory approvals, and difficulties related to integration efforts. Both in the U.S. and abroad, governmental regulation of acquisitions has become more complex, increasing the costs and risks of undertaking significant acquisitions. In order to finance a potential transaction, we may need to raise additional funds by issuing securities or borrowing money. We may not be able to find financing on favorable terms, and the sale of our stock may result in the dilution of our existing shareholders or the issuance of securities with rights that are superior to the rights of our common shareholders.Acquisitions also involve a number of risks, including:•difficulty integrating acquired technologies, operations and personnel with our existing businesses;•diversion of management attention in connection with both negotiating the acquisitions and integrating the assets;•strain on managerial and operational resources as management tries to oversee larger operations;•the future funding requirements for acquired companies, which may be significant;•potential loss of key employees;•exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies; and•increased risk of costly and time-consuming litigation.If we are unable to successfully address these risks, we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of the acquisition, which may have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results.We rely on supplies, services and manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable areas, which could affect our ability to produce products.We, like many companies in the semiconductor industry, rely on supplies, services, internal manufacturing capacity, wafer fabrication foundries and other sub-contractors in geologically unstable locations around the world. This reliance involves risks associated with the impact of earthquakes on us and the semiconductor industry, including temporary loss of capacity, availability and cost of key raw materials, utilities and equipment and availability of key services, including transport of our products worldwide. For example, in fiscal 2011, our revenue in Japan declined as a result of the severe earthquake and tsunami in that country. In addition, flooding in Thailand and the Philippines in 2012 had disruptive effects on local semiconductor-related businesses. Any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities, or those of our subcontractors or third-party wafer fabrication foundries, as a result of fire, flood, natural disaster, unavailability of utilities or otherwise, could result in a temporary or permanent loss of customers for affected products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.We are exposed to business, economic, political, legal and other risks through our significant worldwide operations.We have significant operations and manufacturing facilities outside the United States, including in Ireland and the Philippines. Approximately 69% of our revenue is derived from customers in international markets. Although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations, there can be no assurance that our competitive position will not be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the United States dollar against other currencies. Potential interest rate increases, as well as high energy costs, could have an adverse impact on industrial and consumer spending patterns and could adversely impact demand for our products. At November 2, 2013, our principal source 15of liquidity was $4,682.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, of which approximately $1,318.9 million was held in the United States and the remaining balance was held outside the United States in various foreign subsidiaries. As we intend to reinvest our foreign earnings indefinitely, this cash held outside the United States is not readily available to meet our cash requirements in the United States. We require a substantial amount of cash in the United States for operating requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends and acquisitions. If we are unable to address our U.S. cash requirements through operations, through borrowings under our current credit facility, through future debt or equity offerings or from other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost, it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of earnings that are permanently reinvested, and we may be required to pay additional taxes under current tax laws, which could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition.In addition to being exposed to the ongoing economic cycles in the semiconductor industry, we are also subject to the economic, political and legal risks inherent in international operations, including the risks associated with the recent crisis in global credit and financial markets, ongoing uncertainties and political and economic instability in many countries around the world, as well as economic disruption from acts of terrorism and the response to them by the United States and its allies. Other business risks associated with global operations include increased managerial complexities, air transportation disruptions, expropriation, currency controls, currency exchange rate movement, additional costs related to foreign taxes, tariffs and freight rate increases, exposure to different business practices and legal standards, particularly with respect to price protection, competition practices, intellectual property, anti-corruption and environmental compliance, trade and travel restrictions, pandemics, import and export license requirements and restrictions, difficulties in staffing and managing worldwide operations, and accounts receivable collections.  We also incur significant costs associated with our foreign defined benefit pension plans.  There can be no assurance that the value of the plan assets will be sufficient in the future and it is possible that we may be required to make higher cash contributions to the plans in future years, which would reduce the cash available for other business purposes.We expect to continue to expand our business and operations in China. Our success in the Chinese markets may be adversely affected by China’s continuously evolving laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, currency controls, environmental regulations, indigenous innovation, and intellectual property rights and enforcement of those rights. Enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be inconsistent. In addition, changes in the political environment, governmental policies or U.S.-China relations could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, exposure of our proprietary intellectual property, increased taxation, restrictions on imports, import duties or currency revaluations, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results.Our operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors.A significant portion of our sales are through independent distributors that are not under our control. These independent distributors generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts applied to our products or they could terminate their representation of us. We generally do not require letters of credit from our distributors and are not protected against accounts receivable default or declarations of bankruptcy by these distributors. Our inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our operating results. Termination of a significant distributor, whether at our initiative or the distributor’s initiative or through consolidation in the distribution industry, could disrupt our current business, and if we are unable to find suitable replacements, our operating results could be adversely affected.We are subject to increasingly strict environmental, health and safety (EHS) regulations, which could increase our expenses and affect our operating results.Our industry is subject to increasingly strict EHS requirements, particularly those environmental requirements that control and restrict the sourcing, use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage and disposal of certain chemicals, minerals, elements and materials used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process. Public attention to environmental, sustainability and social responsibility concerns continues to increase, and our customers routinely include stringent environmental and other standards in their contracts with us. Changes in environmental laws or regulations may require us to invest in costly equipment or alter the way our products are made. In addition, we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability for damages caused by potential or actual releases of such materials. Any failure to control such materials adequately or to comply with statutory or regulatory standards or contractual obligations could result in liability for damages, penalties, and civil and criminal fines, and might damage our reputation, increase our expenses, and adversely affect our operating results.Compliance with new “conflict minerals” rules recently promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission will result in increased costs related to investigations to determine the sources of raw materials used in our products, and to any resulting changes to products, processes or sources of supply.  The implementation of these rules could also adversely affect the 16sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products. New climate change laws and regulations could require us to change our manufacturing processes or obtain substitute materials that may cost more or be less available for our manufacturing operations. In addition, new restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases could result in significant costs for us. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has adopted greenhouse gas regulations, and the U.S. Congress may pass federal greenhouse gas legislation in the future. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has issued greenhouse gas reporting regulations that may apply to certain of our operations. The EPA is developing other climate change-based regulations, as are certain states, that also may increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results. We expect increased worldwide regulatory activity relating to climate change in the future. Compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, financial condition or competitive position. There is no assurance that the cost to comply with current or future EHS laws and regulations will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, any failure by us to comply with applicable EHS requirements or contractual obligations could result in penalties, civil and criminal fines, suspension of or changes to production, legal liability and damage to our reputation.If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow, we may not be able to service our debt obligations, including making payments on our outstanding senior unsecured notes.In April 2011, we issued in a public offering $375.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.0% senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2016 (the 2016 Notes).  In June 2013, we issued in a public offering $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.875% senior unsecured notes due June 1, 2023 (the 2023 Notes and together with the 2016 Notes, the Notes).  Our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness when due depends upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our outstanding debt, we may be required to, among other things:•seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets;•refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness, including the Notes;•borrow under our existing revolving credit facility;•divert funds that would otherwise be invested in our operations;•sell selected assets; or•reduce or delay planned capital expenditures or operating expenditures.Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt, including the Notes, which could negatively impact our financial results. In addition, any such financing, refinancing or sale of assets might not be possible on economically favorable terms.Restrictions in our revolving credit facility and outstanding debt instruments may limit our activities.Our current revolving credit facility and our outstanding senior unsecured notes impose, and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may impose, restrictions that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our Company, including to undertake certain transactions, to create certain liens on our assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness. Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, changes in technology and changes in the level of competition. In addition, our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. If we breach any of the covenants under our revolving credit facility or the indenture governing our outstanding Notes and do not obtain appropriate waivers, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness thereunder could be declared immediately due and payable.Our stock price may be volatile.The market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future, as it may be significantly affected by the following factors:•crises in global credit, debt and financial markets;•actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and operating results;•changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or our failure to perform in line with those estimates or our published guidance;17•changes in market valuations of other semiconductor companies;•announcements by us or our competitors of significant new products, technical innovations, material transactions, acquisitions or dispositions, litigation or capital commitments;•departures of key personnel;•alleged noncompliance with laws, regulations or ethics standards by us or any of our employees, officers or directors; and•negative media publicity targeting us or our suppliers, customers or competitors.The stock market has historically experienced volatility, especially within the semiconductor industry, that often has been unrelated to the performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless of our operating results.18"
1,ADI,ANALOG DEVICES,2012-11-27,"ITEM 1A.     RISK FACTORSSet forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the SEC are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking statements contained in this report.Disruptions in global credit and financial markets could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.There is significant uncertainty regarding the stability of global credit and financial markets, exacerbated by the ongoing European debt crisis. These economic uncertainties may lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending, which may cause our customers to cancel, decrease or delay their existing and future orders for our products and make it difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. Uncertainty regarding the future stability of the Euro Zone could cause the value of the Euro to deteriorate, thus reducing the purchasing power of our European customers. In addition, financial difficulties experienced by our suppliers or distributors could result in product delays, increased accounts receivable defaults and inventory challenges. During the past few years, many governments adopted stimulus or spending programs designed to ease the economic impact of the crisis. Some of our businesses benefited from these stimulus programs and there can be no assurance that such programs will continue in the future. If economic conditions deteriorate, we may record additional charges relating to restructuring costs or the impairment of assets and our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.Our future revenue, gross margins, operating results and net income are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate.      Our future revenue, gross margins, operating results and net income are difficult to predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors, including:•the effects of adverse economic conditions in the markets in which we sell our products;•changes in customer demand for our products and for end products that incorporate our products;•our ability to effectively manage our cost structure in both the short term and over a longer duration;•the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us, our customers or our competitors;•competitive pricing pressures;•fluctuations in manufacturing yields, adequate availability of wafers and other raw materials, and manufacturing, assembly and test capacity;•the ability of our third-party suppliers, subcontractors and manufacturers to supply us with sufficient quantities of raw materials, products and/or components;•any significant decline in our backlog;•the timing, delay or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability to manage inventory;•our ability to hire, retain and motivate adequate numbers of engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of our customers;•changes in geographic, product or customer mix;•our ability to utilize our manufacturing facilities at efficient levels;•potential significant litigation-related costs;•the difficulties inherent in forecasting future operating expense levels, including with respect to costs associated with labor, utilities, transportation and raw materials;•the costs related to compliance with increasing worldwide environmental and social responsibility regulations;•changes in our effective tax rates in the United States, Ireland or worldwide; and•the effects of public health emergencies, natural disasters, widespread travel disruptions, security risks, terrorist activities, international conflicts and other events beyond our control.11In addition, the semiconductor market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant economic upturns and downturns. Our business is subject to rapid technological changes and there can be no assurance (i) that products stocked in our inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them, or (ii) that we will be able to produce products in a timely fashion to accommodate changing customer demand. As a result of these and other factors, there can be no assurance that we will not experience material fluctuations in future revenue, gross margins, operating results and net income on a quarterly or annual basis. In addition, if our revenue, gross margins, operating results and net income do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the market price of our common stock may decline.Changes in our effective tax rate may impact our results of operations.A number of factors may increase our future effective tax rate, including: increases in tax rates in various jurisdictions; variation in the jurisdictions in which profits are earned and taxed; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including executive compensation subject to the limitations of Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code and amortization of assets acquired in connection with strategic transactions; the lack of sufficient excess tax benefits (credits) in our additional paid in capital (APIC) pool in situations where our realized tax deductions for certain stock-based compensation awards are less than those originally anticipated; changes in available tax credits; and changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws. Any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact our net income during future periods.Long-term contracts are not typical for us and reductions, cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results.We typically do not have long-term sales contracts with our customers. In certain markets where end-user demand may be particularly volatile and difficult to predict, some customers place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment, even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all, or even any, of the product. In other instances, we manufacture product based on forecasts of customer demands. As a result, we may incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and are subject to the risk of cancellations of orders, leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog. Further, orders or forecasts may be for products that meet the customer’s unique requirements so that those canceled or unrealized orders would, in addition, result in an inventory of unsaleable products, causing potential inventory write-offs. As a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the products that are subject to these uncertainties, the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial. Incorrect forecasts, or reductions, cancellations or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our operating results.Our future success depends upon our ability to continue to innovate, improve our products, develop and market new products, and identify and enter new markets.Our success significantly depends on our continued ability to improve our products and develop and market innovative new products. Product development, innovation and enhancement is often a complex, time-consuming and costly process involving significant investment in research and development, with no assurance of return on investment. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new and improved products in a timely or efficient manner or that new and improved products, if developed, will achieve market acceptance. Our products generally must conform to various evolving and sometimes competing industry standards, which may adversely affect our ability to compete in certain markets or require us to incur significant costs. In addition, our customers generally impose very high quality and reliability standards on our products, which often change and may be difficult or costly to satisfy. Any inability to satisfy customer quality standards or comply with industry standards and technical requirements may adversely affect demand for our products and our results of operations. In addition, our growth is dependent on our continued ability to identify and penetrate new markets where we have limited experience and competition is intense. Also, some of our customers in these markets are less established, which could subject us to increased credit risk. There can be no assurance that the markets we serve will grow in the future, that our existing and new products will meet the requirements of these markets, that our products will achieve customer acceptance in these markets, that competitors will not force price reductions or take market share from us, or that we can achieve or maintain adequate gross margins or profits in these markets. Furthermore, a decline in demand in one or several of our end-user markets could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our results of operations.12We may not be able to compete successfully in markets within the semiconductor industry in the future.We face intense technological and pricing competition in the semiconductor industry, and we expect this competition to increase in the future, including from companies located outside the United States. Many companies have sufficient financial, manufacturing, technical, sales and marketing resources to develop and market products that compete with our products. Some of our competitors may have more advantageous supply or development relationships with our current and potential customers or suppliers. Our competitors also include emerging companies selling specialized products in markets we serve.Competition is generally based on design and quality of products, product performance, features and functionality, and product pricing, availability and capacity, with the relative importance of these factors varying among products, markets and customers. Existing or new competitors may develop products or technologies that more effectively address the demands of our customers and markets with enhanced performance, features and functionality, lower power requirements, greater levels of integration or lower cost. Increased competition in certain markets has resulted in and may continue to result in declining average selling prices, reduced gross margins and loss of market share in those markets. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors, or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased competition.We rely on third-party suppliers, subcontractors and manufacturers for some industry-standard wafers, manufacturing processes and assembly and test services, and generally cannot control their availability or conditions of supply.We rely, and plan to continue to rely, on suppliers, assembly and test subcontractors, and third-party wafer fabricators to supply most of our wafers that can be manufactured using industry-standard submicron processes. This reliance involves several risks, including reduced control over availability, capacity utilization, delivery schedules, manufacturing yields, and costs. We currently source approximately 50% of our wafer requirements annually from third-party wafer fabrication foundries, primarily Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC. In addition, these suppliers often provide manufacturing services to our competitors and therefore periods of increased industry demand may result in capacity constraints. In certain instances, the third-party supplier is the sole source of highly specialized processing services. If our suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver components to us on the time schedule and of the quality or quantity that we require or provide us with required manufacturing processes, we may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers, which could result in additional expenses and delays in product development or shipment of product to our customers. If replacement suppliers or manufacturing processes are not available, we may also experience delays in product development or shipment which could, in turn, result in the temporary or permanent loss of customers.The markets for semiconductor products are cyclical, and increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices, and conversely, we may not be able to satisfy unexpected demand for our products.The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted in periods when demand for our products has increased or decreased rapidly. If we expand our operations and workforce too rapidly or procure excessive resources in anticipation of increased demand for our products, and that demand does not materialize at the pace at which we expect, or declines, or if we overbuild inventory in a period of decreased demand, our operating results may be adversely affected as a result of increased operating expenses, reduced margins, underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges. These capacity expansions by us and other semiconductor manufacturers could also lead to overcapacity in our target markets which could lead to price erosion that would adversely impact our operating results. Conversely, during periods of rapid increases in demand, our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy the demand. In addition, we may not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner, procure adequate resources and raw materials, or locate suitable third-party suppliers, to respond effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for new products requested by our customers, and our current or future business could be materially and adversely affected.Our semiconductor products are complex and we may be subject to product warranty and indemnity claims, which could result in significant costs and damage to our reputation and adversely affect the market acceptance of our products.Semiconductor products are highly complex and may contain defects when they are first introduced or as new versions are developed. We generally warrant our products to our customers for one year from the date title passes from us. We invest significant resources in the testing of our products; however, if any of our products contain defects, we may be required to incur additional development and remediation costs, pursuant to warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer contracts and purchase orders. These problems may divert our technical and other resources from other product development efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers or others, including liability for costs associated with product recalls, which may adversely impact our operating results. We may also be subject to customer indemnity claims. Our customers have on occasion been sued, and may in the future be sued, by third parties alleging infringement of intellectual property rights, or damages resulting from use of our products. Those customers may seek indemnification from us under the terms and conditions of our sales contracts with them. In certain cases, our potential indemnification liability may be significant. If any of our 13products contains defects, or has reliability, quality or compatibility problems, our reputation may be damaged, which could make it more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and prospective customers and could adversely affect our operating results.We have manufacturing processes that utilize a substantial amount of technology as the fabrication of ICs is a highly complex and precise process. Minute impurities, contaminants in the manufacturing environment, difficulties in the fabrication process, defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process, manufacturing equipment failures, wafer breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional. While we have significant expertise in semiconductor manufacturing, it is possible that some processes could become unstable. This instability could result in manufacturing delays and product shortages, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.We are involved in frequent litigation, including regarding intellectual property rights, which could be costly to bring or defend and could require us to redesign products or pay significant royalties.The semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property rights, including claims arising under our contractual obligations to indemnify our customers. Other companies or individuals have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes, and we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling infringing products, if those patents are found to be valid. From time to time, we receive claims from third parties asserting that our products or processes infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights. In the event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we could be forced either to redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that intellectual property, and our operating results could be materially and adversely affected. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement, and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel. We could be subject to warranty or product liability claims that could lead to significant costs and expenses as we defend those claims or pay damage awards. There can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities. We may incur costs and expenses relating to a recall of our customers’ products due to an alleged failure of components we supply. An adverse outcome in litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or on our operating results or cash flows in the period in which the litigation is resolved.We may be unable to adequately protect our proprietary intellectual property rights, which may limit our ability to compete effectively.Our success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We primarily rely on patent, mask work, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietary technologies and processes. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property, it is possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain, copy, use or disclose our technologies, products and processes. Moreover, the laws of foreign countries in which we design, manufacture, market and sell our products may afford little or no effective protection of our proprietary intellectual property. We may also be subject to security breaches caused by computer viruses, illegal break-ins or hacking, sabotage or acts of vandalism by third parties. Our security measures or those of our third party service providers may not detect or prevent such security breaches. Any such compromise of our information security could result in unauthorized access to our confidential business or proprietary information.There can be no assurance that the claims allowed in our issued patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. In addition, any of our existing or future patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. As such, any rights granted under these patents may not provide us with meaningful protection. We may not have foreign patents or pending applications corresponding to our U.S. patents and applications. Even if foreign patents are granted, effective enforcement in foreign countries may not be available. If our patents and mask works do not adequately protect our technology, our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours. Our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology independently or design around our patents.We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and strategic partners. We also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies, documentation and other proprietary information. Despite these efforts, internal or external parties may attempt to copy, disclose, obtain or use our products or technology without our authorization. Also, former employees may seek employment with our business partners, customers or competitors, and there can be no assurance that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment.14If we do not retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our business strategy will be adversely affected.Our continued success depends to a significant extent upon the recruitment, retention and effective succession of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel, particularly our experienced engineers. The competition for these employees is intense. The loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, there could be a material adverse effect on our business should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel. We do not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or employees.To remain competitive, we may need to acquire other companies, purchase or license technology from third parties, or enter into other strategic transactions in order to introduce new products or enhance our existing products.An element of our business strategy involves expansion through the acquisitions of businesses, assets, products or technologies that allow us to complement our existing product offerings, expand our market coverage, increase our engineering workforce or enhance our technological capabilities. We may not be able to find businesses that have the technology or resources we need and, if we find such businesses, we may not be able to purchase or license the technology or resources on commercially favorable terms or at all. Acquisitions and technology licenses are difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons, including the cost of potential transactions, competition among prospective buyers and licensees, the need for regulatory approvals, and difficulties related to integration efforts. Both in the U.S. and abroad, governmental regulation of acquisitions has become more complex, increasing the costs and risks of undertaking significant acquisitions. In order to finance a potential transaction, we may need to raise additional funds by issuing securities or borrowing money. We may not be able to find financing on favorable terms, and the sale of our stock may result in the dilution of our existing shareholders or the issuance of securities with rights that are superior to the rights of our common shareholders.       Acquisitions also involve a number of risks, including:•difficulty integrating acquired technologies, operations and personnel with our existing businesses;•diversion of management attention in connection with both negotiating the acquisitions and integrating the assets;•strain on managerial and operational resources as management tries to oversee larger operations;•the future funding requirements for acquired companies, which may be significant;•potential loss of key employees;•exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies; and•increased risk of costly and time-consuming litigation.If we are unable to successfully address these risks, we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of the acquisition, which may have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results.We rely on supplies, services and manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable areas, which could affect our ability to produce products.We, like many companies in the semiconductor industry, rely on supplies, services, internal manufacturing capacity, wafer fabrication foundries and other sub-contractors in geologically unstable locations around the world. This reliance involves risks associated with the impact of earthquakes on us and the semiconductor industry, including temporary loss of capacity, availability and cost of key raw materials, utilities and equipment and availability of key services, including transport of our products worldwide. For example, our fiscal 2011 revenue in Japan  declined as a result of the severe earthquake and tsunami in that country. In addition, recent flooding in Thailand and the Philippines had disruptive effects on local semiconductor-related businesses. Any prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities, or those of our subcontractors or third-party wafer fabrication foundries, as a result of fire, flood, natural disaster, unavailability of utilities or otherwise, could result in a temporary or permanent loss of customers for affected products, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.15We are exposed to business, economic, political, legal and other risks through our significant worldwide operations.We have significant operations and manufacturing facilities outside the United States, including in Ireland and the Philippines. Approximately 70% of our revenue is derived from customers in international markets. Although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations, there can be no assurance that our competitive position will not be adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the United States dollar against other currencies. Potential interest rate increases, as well as high energy costs, could have an adverse impact on industrial and consumer spending patterns and could adversely impact demand for our products. At November 3, 2012, our principal source of liquidity was $3,900.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, of which approximately $1,105.8 million was held in the United States and the remaining balance was held outside the United States in various foreign subsidiaries. As we intend to reinvest certain of our foreign earnings indefinitely, this cash held outside the United States is not readily available to meet certain of our cash requirements in the United States. We require a substantial amount of cash in the United States for operating requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends and acquisitions. If we are unable to address our U.S. cash requirements through operations, through borrowings under our current credit facility, through future debt or equity offerings or from other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost, it may be necessary for us to consider repatriation of earnings that are permanently reinvested, and we may be required to pay additional taxes under current tax laws, which could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition.In addition to being exposed to the ongoing economic cycles in the semiconductor industry, we are also subject to the economic, political and legal risks inherent in international operations, including the risks associated with the recent crisis in global credit and financial markets, ongoing uncertainties and political and economic instability in many countries around the world, as well as economic disruption from acts of terrorism and the response to them by the United States and its allies. Other business risks associated with global operations include increased managerial complexities, air transportation disruptions, expropriation, currency controls, currency exchange rate movement, additional costs related to foreign taxes, tariffs and freight rate increases, exposure to different business practices and legal standards, particularly with respect to price protection, competition practices, intellectual property, anti-corruption and environmental compliance, trade and travel restrictions, pandemics, import and export license requirements and restrictions, difficulties in staffing and managing worldwide operations, and accounts receivable collections.  We also incur significant costs associated with our foreign defined benefit pension plans.  There can be no assurance that the value of the plan assets will be sufficient in the future and it is possible that we may be required to make higher cash contributions to the plans in future years, which would reduce the cash available for other business purposes.We expect to continue to expand our business and operations in China. Our success in the Chinese markets may be adversely affected by China’s continuously evolving laws and regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and export tariffs, currency controls, environmental regulations, indigenous innovation, and intellectual property rights and enforcement of those rights. Enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be inconsistent. In addition, changes in the political environment, governmental policies or U.S.-China relations could result in revisions to laws or regulations or their interpretation and enforcement, exposure of our proprietary intellectual property, increased taxation, restrictions on imports, import duties or currency revaluations, which could have an adverse effect on our business plans and operating results.Our operating results are dependent on the performance of independent distributors.A significant portion of our sales are through independent distributors that are not under our control. These independent distributors generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts applied to our products or they could terminate their representation of us. We generally do not require letters of credit from our distributors and are not protected against accounts receivable default or declarations of bankruptcy by these distributors. Our inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our operating results. Termination of a significant distributor, whether at our initiative or the distributor’s initiative or through consolidation in the distribution industry, could disrupt our current business, and if we are unable to find suitable replacements, our operating results could be adversely affected.We are subject to increasingly strict environmental, health and safety (EHS) regulations, which could increase our expenses and affect our operating results.Our industry is subject to increasingly strict EHS requirements, particularly those environmental requirements that control and restrict the sourcing, use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage and disposal of certain chemicals, elements and materials used or produced in the semiconductor manufacturing process. Public attention to environmental, sustainability and social responsibility concerns continues to increase, and our customers routinely include stringent environmental and other standards in their contracts with us. Changes in environmental laws or regulations may require us to invest in costly equipment or alter the way our products are made. In addition, we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability for damages caused by potential or actual releases of such materials. Any failure to control such materials 16adequately or to comply with statutory or regulatory standards or contractual obligations could result in liability for damages, penalties, and civil and criminal fines, and might damage our reputation, increase our expenses, and adversely affect our operating results.New climate change laws and regulations could require us to change our manufacturing processes or obtain substitute materials that may cost more or be less available for our manufacturing operations. In addition, new restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases could result in significant costs for us. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has adopted greenhouse gas regulations, and the U.S. Congress may pass federal greenhouse gas legislation in the future. TheU.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has issued greenhouse gas reporting regulations that may apply to certain of our operations. The EPA is developing other climate change-based regulations, as are certain states, that also may increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results. We expect increased worldwide regulatory activity relating to climate change in the future. Compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, financial condition or competitive position. There is no assurance that the cost to comply with current or future EHS laws and regulations will not exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, any failure by us to comply with applicable EHS requirements or contractual obligations could result in penalties, civil and criminal fines, suspension of or changes to production, legal liability and damage to our reputation.If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow, we may not be able to service our debt obligations, including making payments on our two issuances of $375.0 million senior unsecured notes or our $145.0 million term loan facility.In fiscal 2009, we issued in a public offering $375.0 million aggregate principal amount of 5.0% senior unsecured notes due July 1, 2014. In April 2011, we issued in a public offering $375.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.0% senior unsecured notes due April 15, 2016. In December 2010, Analog Devices Holdings B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of ours, entered into a $145.0 million term loan facility which matures on December 22, 2013. Our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness when due depends upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt, we may be required to, among other things:•seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets;•refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness, including the notes;•divert funds that would otherwise be invested in our operations;•sell selected assets; or•reduce or delay planned capital expenditures or operating expenditures.Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt, including the notes or our term loan facility, which could negatively impact our financial results. In addition, any such financing, refinancing or sale of assets might not be possible on economically favorable terms.Restrictions in our revolving credit and term loan facilities and outstanding debt instruments may limit our activities.Our current revolving credit and term loan facilities and our 5.0% and 3.0% senior unsecured notes impose, and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may impose, restrictions that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company, including to undertake certain transactions, to create certain liens on our assets and to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness. Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, changes in technology and changes in the level of competition. In addition, our credit and term loan facilities require us to maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. If we breach any of the covenants under our credit or term loan facilities or the indenture governing our outstanding notes and do not obtain appropriate waivers, then, subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness thereunder could be declared immediately due and payable.17Our stock price may be volatile.The market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future, as it may be significantly affected by the following factors:•crises in global credit, debt and financial markets;•actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and operating results;•changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or our failure to perform in line with those estimates or our published guidance;•changes in market valuations of other semiconductor companies;•announcements by us or our competitors of significant new products, technical innovations, material transactions, acquisitions or dispositions, litigation or capital commitments;•departures of key personnel;•alleged noncompliance with laws, regulations or ethics standards by us or any of our employees, officers or directors; and•negative media publicity targeting us or our suppliers, customers or competitors.The stock market has historically experienced volatility, especially within the semiconductor industry, that often has been unrelated to the performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless of our operating results.18"
5,ADI,ANALOG DEVICES,2010-11-22,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS"" --> ITEM 1A.  RISK    FACTORS     Set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other    documents we file with the SEC are descriptions of the risks and    uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ    materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking    statements contained in this report. Disruptions    in global credit and financial markets could materially and    adversely affect our business and results of    operations.     Global credit and financial markets appear to be recovering from    extreme disruptions experienced over the past two years.    However, uncertainty about continuing economic stability    remains. Our business was significantly affected by the global    economic crisis. These economic uncertainties affect businesses    such as ours in a number of ways, making it difficult to    accurately forecast and plan our future business activities.    High unemployment rates, continued weakness in commercial and    residential real estate markets and the tightening of credit by    financial institutions may lead consumers and businesses to    continue to postpone spending, which may cause our customers to    cancel, decrease or delay their existing and future orders with    us. In addition, the inability of customers to obtain credit    could impair their ability to make timely payments to us.    Customer insolvencies could also negatively impact our revenues    and our ability to collect receivables. In addition, financial    difficulties experienced by our suppliers or distributors could    result in product delays, increased accounts receivable defaults    and inventory challenges. Financial turmoil may cause financial    institutions to consolidate or go out of business, which    increases the risk that the actual amounts realized in the    future on our financial instruments could differ significantly    from the fair value assigned to them. During the global    financial crisis, many governments adopted stimulus or spending    programs designed to ease the economic impact of the crisis.    Some of our businesses benefited from these stimulus programs    and as these programs conclude, those businesses could be    negatively impacted. The recent debt crisis in certain European    countries could cause the value of the Euro to deteriorate, thus    reducing the purchasing power of our European customers. In    addition, the recent European debt crisis and related financial    restructuring efforts has contributed to the instability in    global credit markets. We are unable to predict the impact of    these events on the apparent economic recovery, and if economic    conditions deteriorate again, we may record additional charges    relating to restructuring costs or the impairment of assets and    our business and results of operations could be materially and    adversely affected. Our    future revenue, gross margins, operating results and net income    are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate.     Our future revenue, gross margins, operating results and net    income are difficult to predict and may be materially affected    by a number of factors, including:           the effects of adverse economic conditions in the United States    and international markets;           changes in customer demand for our products and for end products    that incorporate our products;           the effectiveness of our efforts to refocus our operations,    including our ability to reduce our cost structure in both the    short term and over a longer duration;           the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us,    our customers or our competitors;           competitive pricing pressures;           fluctuations in manufacturing yields, adequate availability of    wafers and other raw materials, and manufacturing, assembly and    test capacity;           the ability of our third party suppliers, subcontractors and    manufactures to supply us with sufficient quantities of products    or components;           any significant decline in our backlog;           the timing, delay or cancellation of significant customer orders    and our ability to manage inventory;    11Table of Contents           our ability to hire, retain and motivate adequate numbers of    engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of    our customers;           changes in geographic, product or customer mix;           our ability to utilize our manufacturing facilities at efficient    levels;           potential significant litigation-related costs;           the difficulties inherent in forecasting future operating    expense levels, including with respect to costs associated with    labor, utilities, transportation and raw materials;           the costs related to compliance with increasing worldwide    environmental regulations;           changes in our effective tax rates in the United States, Ireland    or worldwide; and           the effects of public health emergencies, natural disasters,    widespread travel disruptions, security risks, terrorist    activities, international conflicts and other events beyond our    control.     In addition, the semiconductor market has historically been    cyclical and subject to significant economic upturns and    downturns. Our business is subject to rapid technological    changes and there can be no assurance, depending on the mix of    future business, that products stocked in our inventory will not    be rendered obsolete before we ship them. As a result of these    and other factors, there can be no assurance that we will not    experience material fluctuations in future revenue, gross    margins, operating results and net income on a quarterly or    annual basis. In addition, if our revenue, gross margins,    operating results and net income do not meet the expectations of    securities analysts or investors, the market price of our common    stock may decline. Changes    in our effective tax rate may impact our results of    operations.     A number of factors may increase our future effective tax rate,    including: increases in tax rates in various jurisdictions; the    jurisdictions in which profits are earned and taxed; the    resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax    authorities; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets    and liabilities; adjustments to income taxes upon finalization    of various tax returns; increases in expenses not deductible for    tax purposes, including write-offs of acquired in-process    research and development and impairments of goodwill in    connection with acquisitions; changes in available tax credits;    and changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws.    Any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could    adversely impact our net income for future periods. Long-term    contracts are not typical for us and reductions, cancellations    or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our    operating results.     We typically do not have long-term sales contracts with our    customers. In certain markets where end-user demand may be    particularly volatile and difficult to predict, some customers    place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it    available for shipment, even though the customer is unwilling to    make a binding commitment to purchase all, or even any, of the    product. In other instances, we manufacture product based on    forecasts of customer demands. As a result, we may incur    inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated    sales and are subject to the risk of cancellations of orders,    leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog. Further,    orders or forecasts may be for products that meet the    customers unique requirements so that those cancelled or    unrealized orders would, in addition, result in an inventory of    unsaleable products, causing potential inventory write-offs. As    a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the    products that are subject to these uncertainties, the amount of    unsaleable product could be substantial. Incorrect forecasts, or    reductions, cancellations or delays in orders for our products    could adversely affect our operating results. Our    future success depends upon our ability to continue to innovate,    improve our products, develop and market new products, and    identify and enter new markets.     Our success significantly depends on our continued ability to    improve our products and develop and market innovative new    products. Product development, innovation and enhancement is    often a complex, time-consuming and costly process involving    significant investment in research and development, with no    assurance of return on    12Table of Contents    investment. There can be no assurance that we will be able to    develop and introduce new and improved products in a timely or    efficient manner or that new and improved products, if    developed, will achieve market acceptance. Our products    generally must conform to various evolving and sometimes    competing industry standards, which may adversely affect our    ability to compete in certain markets or require us to incur    significant costs. In addition, our customers generally impose    very high quality and reliability standards on our products,    which often change and may be difficult or costly to satisfy.    Any inability to satisfy customer quality standards or comply    with industry standards and technical requirements may adversely    affect demand for our products and our results of operations. In    addition, our growth is dependent on our continued ability to    identify and penetrate new markets where we have limited    experience and competition is intense. Also, some of our    customers in these markets are less established, which could    subject us to increased credit risk. There can be no assurance    that the markets we serve will grow in the future, that our    existing and new products will meet the requirements of these    markets, that our products will achieve customer acceptance in    these markets, that competitors will not force price reductions    or take market share from us, or that we can achieve or maintain    adequate gross margins or profits in these markets. Furthermore,    a decline in demand in one or several of our end-user markets    could have a material adverse effect on the demand for our    products and our results of operations. We may    not be able to compete successfully in markets within the    semiconductor industry in the future.     We face intense technological and pricing competition in the    semiconductor industry, and we expect this competition to    increase in the future, including from companies located outside    the United States. Many other companies offer products that    compete with our products. Some have greater financial,    manufacturing, technical, sales and marketing resources than we    have. Some of our competitors may have more advantageous supply    or development relationships with our current and potential    customers or suppliers. Our competitors also include emerging    companies selling specialized products in markets we serve.    Competition is generally based on design and quality of    products, product performance, features and functionality, and    product pricing, availability and capacity, with the relative    importance of these factors varying among products, markets and    customers. Existing or new competitors may develop products or    technologies that more effectively address the demands of our    customers and markets with enhanced performance, features and    functionality, lower power requirements, greater levels of    integration or lower cost. Increased competition in certain    markets has resulted in and may continue to result in declining    average selling prices, reduced gross margins and loss of market    share in those markets. There can be no assurance that we will    be able to compete successfully in the future against existing    or new competitors, or that our operating results will not be    adversely affected by increased competition. We rely    on third-party suppliers, subcontractors and manufacturers for    some industry-standard wafers, manufacturing processes and    assembly and test services, and generally cannot control their    availability or conditions of supply.     We rely, and plan to continue to rely, on suppliers, assembly    and test subcontractors, and third-party wafer fabricators to    supply most of our wafers that can be manufactured using    industry-standard submicron processes. This reliance involves    several risks, including reduced control over availability,    capacity utilization, delivery schedules, manufacturing yields,    and costs. Additionally, we utilize a limited number of    third-party wafer fabricators, primarily Taiwan Semiconductor    Manufacturing Company, or TSMC. In addition, these suppliers    often provide manufacturing services to our competitors and    therefore periods of increased industry demand may result in    capacity constraints. In certain instances, the third party    supplier is the sole source of highly specialized processing    services. If our suppliers are unable or unwilling to    manufacture and deliver components to us on the time schedule    and of the quality or quantity that we require or provide us    with required manufacturing processes, we may be forced to seek    to engage additional or replacement suppliers, which could    result in additional expenses and delays in product development    or shipment of product to our customers. If replacement    suppliers or manufacturing processes are not available, we may    also experience delays in product development or shipment which    could, in turn, result in the temporary or permanent loss of    customers. A significant portion of our fiscal 2010 revenue was    from products fabricated at third-party wafer-fabrication    facilities, primarily TSMC.    13Table of ContentsThe    markets for semiconductor products are cyclical, and increased    production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices, and    conversely, we may not be able to satisfy unexpected demand for    our products.     The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted    in periods when demand for our products has increased or    decreased rapidly. If we expand our operations and workforce too    rapidly or procure excessive resources in anticipation of    increased demand for our products, and that demand does not    materialize at the pace at which we expect or declines, or if we    overbuild inventory in a period of decreased demand, our    operating results may be adversely affected as a result of    increased operating expenses, reduced margins, underutilization    of capacity or asset impairment charges. These capacity    expansions by us and other semiconductor manufacturers could    also lead to overcapacity in our target markets which could lead    to price erosion that would adversely impact our operating    results. Conversely, during periods of rapid increases in    demand, our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy    the demand. In addition, we may not be able to expand our    workforce and operations in a sufficiently timely manner,    procure adequate resources, or locate suitable third-party    suppliers, to respond effectively to changes in demand for our    existing products or to the demand for new products requested by    our customers, and our current or future business could be    materially and adversely affected. Our    semiconductor products are complex and we may be subject to    product warranty and indemnity claims, which could result in    significant costs and damage to our reputation and adversely    affect the market acceptance of our products.     Semiconductor products are highly complex and may contain    defects when they are first introduced or as new versions are    developed. We generally warrant our products to our customers    for one year from the date title passes from us. We invest    significant resources in the testing of our products; however,    if any of our products contain defects, we may be required to    incur additional development and remediation costs, pursuant to    warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer    contracts and purchase orders. These problems may divert our    technical and other resources from other product development    efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers    or others, including liability for costs associated with product    recalls, which may adversely impact our operating results. We    may also be subject to customer indemnity claims. Our customers    have on occasion been sued, and may in the future be sued, by    third parties with respect to infringement or other product    matters, and those customers may seek indemnification from us    under the terms and conditions of our sales contracts with them.    In certain cases, our potential indemnification liability may be    significant. If any of our products contains defects, or has    reliability, quality or compatibility problems, our reputation    may be damaged, which could make it more difficult for us to    sell our products to existing and prospective customers and    could adversely affect our operating results.     We have manufacturing processes that utilize a substantial    amount of technology as the fabrication of integrated circuits    is a highly complex and precise process. Minute impurities,    contaminants in the manufacturing environment, difficulties in    the fabrication process, defects in the masks used in the wafer    manufacturing process, manufacturing equipment failures, wafer    breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of    wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be    nonfunctional. While we have significant expertise in    semiconductor manufacturing, it is possible that some processes    could become unstable. This instability could result in    manufacturing delays and product shortages, which could have a    material adverse effect on our operating results. We are    involved in frequent litigation, including regarding    intellectual property rights, which could be costly to bring or    defend and could require us to redesign products or pay    significant royalties.     The semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims    and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property    rights, including claims arising under our contractual    obligations to indemnify our customers. Other companies or    individuals have obtained patents covering a variety of    semiconductor designs and processes, and we might be required to    obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from    making and selling infringing products, if those patents are    found to be valid. From time to time, we receive claims from    third parties asserting that our products or processes infringe    their patents or other intellectual property rights. In the    event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim    against us and a license is not available to us on commercially    reasonable terms, or at all, we could be forced either to    redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that    intellectual property, and our operating results could be    materially and adversely affected. Litigation may be    14Table of Contents    necessary to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual    property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement,    and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of    our key personnel. We could be subject to warranty or product    liability claims that could lead to significant costs and    expenses as we defend those claims or pay damage awards. There    can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect    against all claims and potential liabilities. We may incur costs    and expenses relating to a recall of our customers    products due to an alleged failure of components we supply. An    adverse outcome in litigation could have a material adverse    effect on our financial position or on our operating results or    cash flows in the period in which the litigation is resolved. We may be    unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights, which may    limit our ability to compete effectively.     Our success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our    intellectual property. We primarily rely on patent, mask work,    copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as    nondisclosure agreements and other methods, to protect our    proprietary technologies and processes. Despite our efforts to    protect our proprietary technologies and processes, it is    possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties    may obtain, copy, use or disclose our technologies, products and    processes. Moreover, the laws of foreign countries in which we    design, manufacture, market and sell our products may afford    little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology.     There can be no assurance that the claims allowed in our issued    patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. In    addition, any of our existing or future patents may be    challenged, invalidated or circumvented. As such, any rights    granted under these patents may not provide us with meaningful    protection. We may not have foreign patents or pending    applications corresponding to our U.S. patents and    applications. Even if foreign patents are granted, effective    enforcement in foreign countries may not be available. If our    patents and mask works do not adequately protect our technology,    our competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours.    Our competitors may also be able to develop similar technology    independently or design around our patents.     We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our    employees, consultants and strategic partners. We also try to    control access to and distribution of our technologies,    documentation and other proprietary information. Despite these    efforts, internal or external parties may attempt to copy,    disclose, obtain or use our products or technology without our    authorization. Also, former employees may seek employment with    our business partners, customers or competitors, and there can    be no assurance that the confidential nature of our proprietary    information will be maintained in the course of such future    employment. If we do    not retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our    business strategy will be adversely affected.     Our continued success depends to a significant extent upon the    recruitment, retention and effective succession of our executive    officers and key management and technical personnel,    particularly our experienced engineers. The competition for    these employees is intense. The loss of the services of one or    more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect    on our operating results. In addition, there could be a material    adverse effect on our business should the turnover rates for    engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if    we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel. We do    not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our    officers or employees. To remain    competitive, we may need to acquire other companies, purchase or    license technology from third parties, or enter into other    strategic transactions in order to introduce new products or    enhance our existing products.     An element of our business strategy involves expansion through    the acquisitions of businesses, assets, products or technologies    that allow us to complement our existing product offerings,    expand our market coverage, increase our engineering workforce    or enhance our technological capabilities. We may not be able to    find businesses that have the technology or resources we need    and, if we find such businesses, we may not be able to purchase    or license the technology or resources on commercially favorable    terms or at all. Acquisitions and technology licenses are    difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons,    including the cost of potential transactions, competition among    prospective buyers and licensees, the need for regulatory    approvals, and difficulties related to integration efforts. Both    in the U.S. and abroad, governmental regulation of    acquisitions has become more complex, increasing the costs and    risks of undertaking significant acquisitions. In order to    finance a potential transaction, we may need to    15Table of Contents    raise additional funds by issuing securities or borrowing money.    We may not be able to find financing on favorable terms, and the    sale of our stock may result in the dilution of our existing    shareholders or the issuance of securities with rights that are    superior to the rights of our common shareholders.     Acquisitions also involve a number of risks, including:           difficulty integrating acquired technologies, operations and    personnel with our existing businesses;           diversion of management attention in connection with both    negotiating the acquisitions and integrating the assets;           strain on managerial and operational resources as management    tries to oversee larger operations;           the future funding requirements for acquired companies, which    may be significant;           potential loss of key employees;           exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired    companies; and           increased risk of costly and time-consuming litigation.     If we are unable to successfully address these risks, we may not    realize some or all of the expected benefits of the acquisition,    which may have an adverse effect on our business plans and    operating results. We rely    on manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable    areas, which could affect the availability of supplies and    services.     We, like many companies in the semiconductor industry, rely on    internal manufacturing capacity, wafer fabrication foundries and    other    sub-contractors    in geologically unstable locations around the world. This    reliance involves risks associated with the impact of    earthquakes on us and the semiconductor industry, including    temporary loss of capacity, availability and cost of key raw    materials, utilities and equipment and availability of key    services, including transport of our products worldwide. Any    prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing    facilities, or those of our subcontractors or third-party wafer    fabrication foundries, as a result of fire, natural disaster,    unavailability of utilities or otherwise, could result in a    temporary or permanent loss of customers for affected products,    which could have a material adverse effect on our results of    operations and financial condition. We are    exposed to business, economic, political, legal and other risks    through our significant worldwide operations.     We have significant operations and manufacturing facilities    outside the United States, including in Ireland and the    Philippines. During fiscal 2010, we derived approximately 81% of    our revenue from customers in international markets. Although we    engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to    currency exchange rate fluctuations, there can be no assurance    that our competitive position will not be adversely affected by    changes in the exchange rate of the United States dollar against    other currencies. Potential interest rate increases, as well as    high energy costs, could have an adverse impact on industrial    and consumer spending patterns and could adversely impact demand    for our products. While a majority of our cash is generated    outside the United States, we require a substantial amount of    cash in the United States for operating requirements, stock    repurchases, cash dividends and acquisitions. If we are unable    to address our U.S. cash requirements through operations,    through borrowings under our current credit facility or from    other sources of cash obtained at an acceptable cost, our    business strategies and operating results could be adversely    affected.     In addition to being exposed to the ongoing economic cycles in    the semiconductor industry, we are also subject to the economic,    political and legal risks inherent in international operations,    including the risks associated with the recent crisis in global    credit and financial markets, ongoing uncertainties and    political and economic instability in many countries around the    world, as well as economic disruption from acts of terrorism and    the response to them by the United States and its allies. Other    business risks associated with global operations include    increased managerial complexities, air transportation    disruptions, expropriation, currency controls, currency exchange    rate movement, additional costs related to foreign taxes,    tariffs and freight rate increases, exposure to different    business practices and legal standards, particularly with    respect to price protection, competition practices, intellectual    property, anti-    16Table of Contents    corruption and environmental compliance, trade and travel    restrictions, pandemics, import and export license requirements    and restrictions, difficulties in staffing and managing    worldwide operations, and accounts receivable collections.     We expect to continue to expand our business and operations in    China. Our success in the Chinese markets may be adversely    affected by Chinas continuously evolving laws and    regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and    export tariffs, currency controls, environmental regulations,    anti-corruption, and intellectual property rights and    enforcement of those rights. Enforcement of existing laws or    agreements may be inconsistent. In addition, changes in the    political environment, governmental policies or    U.S.-China    relations could result in revisions to laws or regulations or    their interpretation and enforcement, increased taxation,    restrictions on imports, import duties or currency revaluations,    which could have an adverse effect on our business plans and    operating results. Our    operating results are dependent on the performance of    independent distributors.     A significant portion of our sales are through independent    distributors that are not under our control. These independent    distributors generally represent product lines offered by    several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts    applied to our products or they could terminate their    representation of us. We generally do not require letters of    credit from our distributors and are not protected against    accounts receivable default or bankruptcy by these distributors.    Our inability to collect open accounts receivable could    adversely affect our operating results. Termination of a    significant distributor, whether at our initiative or the    distributors initiative, could disrupt our current    business, and if we are unable to find suitable replacements,    our operating results could be adversely affected. We are    subject to increasingly strict environmental health and safety    (EHS) regulations, which could increase our expenses and affect    our operating results.     Our industry is subject to increasingly strict EHS requirements,    particularly those environmental requirements that control and    restrict the use, transportation, emission, discharge, storage    and disposal of certain chemicals used or produced in the    semiconductor manufacturing process. Public attention to    environmental concerns continues to increase, and our customers    routinely include stringent environmental standards in their    contracts with us. Changes in environmental regulations may    require us to invest in potentially costly pollution control    equipment or alter the way our products are made. In addition,    we use hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us    to risks of strict liability for damages caused by releases of    such materials. Any failure to control such materials adequately    or to comply with regulatory restrictions or contractual    obligations could result in penalties, civil and criminal fines,    and damage our reputation, and might increase our expenses and    adversely affect our operating results.     New climate change regulations could require us to change our    manufacturing processes or obtain substitute materials that may    cost more or be less available for our manufacturing operations.    In addition, new restrictions on carbon dioxide or other    greenhouse gas emissions could result in significant costs for    us. The Commonwealth of Massachusetts has adopted greenhouse gas    requirements, and the U.S. Congress may pass federal    greenhouse gas legislation in the future. The    U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is preparing    greenhouse gas reporting regulations that are likely to apply to    us. EPA may propose other climate change-based regulations that    also may increase our expenses and adversely affect our    operating results. We expect increased worldwide regulatory    activity relating to climate change in the future. Compliance    with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on    our capital expenditures, earnings, financial condition or    competitive position. There is no assurance that the cost to    comply with current or future EHS laws and regulations will not    exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial condition    or results of operations. Additionally, any failure by us to    comply with applicable EHS requirements or contractual    obligations could result in penalties, civil and criminal fines,    suspension of or changes to production, legal liability and    damage to our reputation. If we are    unable to generate sufficient cash flow, we may not be able to    service our debt obligations, including making payments on our    $375 million senior unsecured notes.     In fiscal 2009, we issued in a public offering $375 million    aggregate principal amount of 5.0% senior unsecured notes    due July 1, 2014. Our ability to make payments of principal    and interest on our indebtedness when    17Table of Contents    due depends upon our future performance, which will be subject    to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial,    business and other factors affecting our consolidated    operations, many of which are beyond our control. If we are    unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the    future to service our debt, we may be required to, among other    things:           seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets;           refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness,    including the notes;           sell selected assets;           reduce or delay planned capital expenditures; or           reduce or delay planned operating expenditures.     Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service    our debt, including the notes, which could negatively impact our    financial results. In addition, any such financing, refinancing    or sale of assets might not be possible on economically    favorable terms. Restrictions    in our credit facility and outstanding debt instruments may    limit our activities.     Our current credit facility and our 5.0% senior unsecured    notes impose, and future debt instruments to which we may become    subject may impose, restrictions that limit our ability to    engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company,    including to undertake certain transactions, to create certain    liens on our assets and to incur certain subsidiary    indebtedness. Our ability to comply with these financial    restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future    performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions    and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control    such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, changes in    technology and changes in the level of competition. In addition,    our credit facility requires us to maintain compliance with    specified financial ratios. If we breach any of the covenants    under our credit facility or the indenture governing our    outstanding notes and do not obtain appropriate waivers, then,    subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness    thereunder could be declared immediately due and payable. Our stock    price may be volatile.     The market price of our common stock has been volatile in the    past and may be volatile in the future, as it may be    significantly affected by the following factors:           crises in global credit, debt and financial markets;           actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and operating    results;           changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or our    failure to perform in line with those estimates or our published    guidance;           changes in market valuations of other semiconductor companies;           announcements by us or our competitors of significant new    products, technical innovations, acquisitions or dispositions,    litigation or capital commitments;           departures of key personnel;           actual or perceived noncompliance with corporate responsibility    or ethics standards by us or any of our employees, officers or    directors; and           negative media publicity targeting us or our competitors.     The stock market has historically experienced volatility,    especially within the semiconductor industry, that often has    been unrelated to the performance of particular companies. These    market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless    of our operating results.    18Table of Contents"

RISK FACTORS"" --> ITEM 1A.  RISK    FACTORS     Set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other    documents we file with the SEC are descriptions of the risks and    uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ    materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking    statements contained in this report. The    current crisis in global credit and financial markets could    further materially and adversely affect our business and results    of operations.     As widely reported, global credit and financial markets continue    to experience disruptions, including diminished liquidity and    credit availability, declines in consumer confidence, declines    in economic growth, increases in unemployment rates, and    uncertainty about economic stability. Our business has been    significantly affected by these conditions. While there are    signs that conditions may be improving, there is no certainty    that this trend will continue or that credit and financial    markets and confidence in economic conditions will not    deteriorate again. These economic uncertainties affect    businesses such as ours in a number of ways, making it difficult    to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities.    Accelerating layoffs, falling housing markets and the tightening    of credit by financial institutions may lead consumers and    businesses to continue to postpone spending, which may cause our    customers to cancel, decrease or delay their existing and future    orders with us. In addition, the inability of customers to    obtain credit could impair their ability to make timely payments    to us. Customer insolvencies in key industries, such as the    automotive industry, could also negatively impact our revenues    and our ability to collect receivables. In addition, financial    difficulties experienced by our suppliers or distributors could    result in product delays, increased accounts receivable defaults    and inventory challenges. The financial turmoil could cause    financial institutions to consolidate or go out of business,    which increases the risk that the actual amounts realized in the    future on our financial instruments could differ significantly    from the fair value assigned to them. We are unable to predict    the likely duration and severity of the current disruptions in    the credit and financial markets and adverse global economic    conditions, and if the current uncertain economic conditions    continue or further deteriorate, we may record additional    charges relating to restructuring costs or the impairment of    assets and our business and results of operations could be    materially and adversely affected. Our    future revenue, gross margins, operating results and net income    are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate.     Our future revenue, gross margins, operating results and net    income are difficult to predict and may be materially affected    by a number of factors, including:           the effects of adverse economic conditions in the United States    and international markets;           changes in customer demand for our products and for end products    that incorporate our products;           the effectiveness of our efforts to refocus our operations,    including our ability to reduce our cost structure in both the    short term and over a longer duration;           the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us,    our customers or our competitors;           competitive pricing pressures;           fluctuations in manufacturing yields, adequate availability of    wafers and other raw materials, and manufacturing, assembly and    test capacity;           any significant decline in our backlog;           the timing, delay or cancellation of significant customer orders    and our ability to manage inventory;           our ability to hire, retain and motivate adequate numbers of    engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of    our customers;           changes in geographic, product or customer mix;           our ability to utilize our manufacturing facilities at efficient    levels;    10            potential significant litigation-related costs;           the difficulties inherent in forecasting future operating    expense levels, including with respect to costs associated with    labor, utilities, transportation and raw materials;           the costs related to compliance with increasing worldwide    environmental regulations;           changes in our effective tax rates in the United States, Ireland    or worldwide; and           the effects of public health emergencies, natural disasters,    security risks, terrorist activities, international conflicts    and other events beyond our control.     In addition, the semiconductor market has historically been    cyclical and subject to significant economic upturns and    downturns. Our business is subject to rapid technological    changes and there can be no assurance, depending on the mix of    future business, that products stocked in our inventory will not    be rendered obsolete before we ship them. As a result of these    and other factors, there can be no assurance that we will not    experience material fluctuations in future revenue, gross    margins, operating results and net income on a quarterly or    annual basis. In addition, if our revenue, gross margins,    operating results and net income do not meet the expectations of    securities analysts or investors, the market price of our common    stock may decline. Changes    in our effective tax rate may impact our results of    operations.     A number of factors may increase our future effective tax rate,    including: the jurisdictions in which profits are earned and    taxed; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with    various tax authorities; changes in the valuation of our    deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to income taxes    upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses    not deductible for tax purposes, including write-offs of    acquired in-process research and development and impairments of    goodwill in connection with acquisitions; changes in available    tax credits; and changes in tax laws or the interpretation of    such tax laws. Any significant increase in our future effective    tax rates could adversely impact our net income for future    periods. Long-term    contracts are not typical for us and reductions, cancellations    or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our    operating results.     We typically do not have long-term sales contracts with our    customers. In certain markets where end-user demand may be    particularly volatile and difficult to predict, some customers    place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it    available for shipment, even though the customer is unwilling to    make a binding commitment to purchase all, or even any, of the    product. In other instances, we manufacture product based on    forecasts of customer demands. As a result, we may incur    inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated    sales and are subject to the risk of cancellations of orders,    leading to a sharp reduction of sales and backlog. Further,    orders or forecasts may be for products that meet the    customers unique requirements so that those cancelled or    unrealized orders would, in addition, result in an inventory of    unsaleable products, causing potential inventory write-offs. As    a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the    products that are subject to these uncertainties, the amount of    unsaleable product could be substantial. Incorrect forecasts, or    reductions, cancellations or delays in orders for our products    could adversely affect our operating results. Our    future success depends upon our ability to continue to innovate,    improve our products, develop and market new products, and    identify and enter new markets.     Our success significantly depends on our continued ability to    improve our products and develop and market innovative new    products. Product development, innovation and enhancement is    often a complex, time-consuming and costly process involving    significant investment in research and development, with no    assurance of return on investment. There can be no assurance    that we will be able to develop and introduce new and improved    products in a timely or efficient manner or that new and    improved products, if developed, will achieve market acceptance.    Our products generally must conform to various evolving and    sometimes competing industry standards, which may adversely    affect our ability to compete in certain markets or require us    to incur significant costs. In addition, our customers generally    impose very high quality and reliability standards on our    products, which often change and may be difficult or costly to    satisfy. Any inability to satisfy customer quality standards or    comply with industry    11     standards and technical requirements may adversely affect demand    for our products and our results of operations. In addition, our    growth is dependent on our continued ability to identify and    penetrate new markets where we have limited experience and    competition is intense. Also, some of our customers in these    markets are less established, which could subject us to    increased credit risk. There can be no assurance that the    markets we serve will grow in the future, that our existing and    new products will meet the requirements of these markets, that    our products will achieve customer acceptance in these markets,    that competitors will not force price reductions or take market    share from us, or that we can achieve or maintain adequate gross    margins or profits in these markets. Furthermore, a decline in    demand in one or several of our end-user markets could have a    material adverse effect on the demand for our products and our    results of operations. We may    not be able to compete successfully in markets within the    semiconductor industry in the future.     We face intense technological and pricing competition in the    semiconductor industry, and we expect this competition to    increase in the future. Many other companies offer products that    compete with our products. Some have greater financial,    manufacturing, technical and marketing resources than we have.    Some of our competitors may have more advantageous supply or    development relationships with our current and potential    customers or suppliers. Our competitors also include emerging    companies selling specialized products in markets we serve.    Competition is generally based on design and quality of    products, product performance, features and functionality, and    product pricing, availability and capacity, with the relative    importance of these factors varying among products, markets and    customers. Existing or new competitors may develop products or    technologies that more effectively address the demands of our    customers and markets with enhanced performance, features and    functionality, lower power requirements, greater levels of    integration or lower cost. Increased competition in certain    markets has resulted in and may continue to result in declining    average selling prices, reduced gross margins and loss of market    share in those markets. There can be no assurance that we will    be able to compete successfully in the future against existing    or new competitors, or that our operating results will not be    adversely affected by increased competition. We rely    on third-party subcontractors and manufacturers for some    industry-standard wafers and assembly and test services, and    generally cannot control their availability or conditions of    supply.     We rely, and plan to continue to rely, on assembly and test    subcontractors and on third-party wafer fabricators to supply    most of our wafers that can be manufactured using    industry-standard submicron processes. This reliance involves    several risks, including reduced control over availability,    capacity utilization, delivery schedules, manufacturing yields,    quality assurance and costs. Additionally, we utilize a limited    number of third-party wafer fabricators, primarily Taiwan    Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, or TSMC. These suppliers    manufacture components in accordance with our proprietary    designs and specifications. In addition, these suppliers often    provide manufacturing services to our competitors and therefore    periods of increased industry demand may result in capacity    constraints. If these suppliers are unable or unwilling to    manufacture and deliver sufficient quantities of components to    us on the time schedule and of the quality that we require, we    may be forced to seek to engage additional or replacement    suppliers, which could result in additional expenses and delays    in product development or shipment of product to our customers.    Approximately 49% of our fiscal year 2009 revenue was from    products fabricated at third-party wafer-fabrication facilities,    primarily TSMC. The    markets for semiconductor products are cyclical, and increased    production may lead to overcapacity and lower prices, and    conversely, we may not be able to satisfy unexpected demand for    our products.     The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted    in periods when demand for our products has increased or    decreased rapidly. If we expand our operations and workforce too    rapidly or procure excessive resources in anticipation of    increased demand for our products, and that demand does not    materialize at the pace at which we expect or declines, or if we    overbuild inventory in a period of decreased demand, our    operating results may be adversely affected as a result of    increased operating expenses, reduced margins, underutilization    of capacity or asset impairment charges. These capacity    expansions by us and other semiconductor manufacturers could    also lead to overcapacity in our target markets which could lead    to price erosion that would adversely impact our operating    results. Conversely, during periods of rapid increases in    demand, our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy    the demand. In addition, we may not be able to expand our    workforce and operations in a    12     sufficiently timely manner, procure adequate resources, or    locate suitable third-party suppliers, to respond effectively to    changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for    new products requested by our customers, and our current or    future business could be materially and adversely affected. Our    semiconductor products are complex and we may be subject to    product warranty and indemnity claims, which could result in    significant costs and damage to our reputation and adversely    affect the market acceptance of our products.     Semiconductor products are highly complex and may contain    defects when they are first introduced or as new versions are    developed. We generally warrant our products to our customers    for one year from the date title passes from us. We invest    significant resources in the testing of our products; however,    if any of our products contain defects, we may be required to    incur additional development and remediation costs, pursuant to    warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer    contracts and purchase orders. These problems may divert our    technical and other resources from other product development    efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers    or others, including liability for costs associated with product    recalls, which may adversely impact our operating results. We    may also be subject to customer indemnity claims. Our customers    have on occasion been sued, and may in the future be sued by    third parties with respect to infringement or other product    matters, and those customers may seek indemnification from us    under the terms and conditions of our sales contracts with them.    In certain cases, our potential indemnification liability may be    significant. There can be no assurance that we are adequately    insured to protect against all claims and potential liabilities.    If any of our products contains defects, or has reliability,    quality or compatibility problems, our reputation may be    damaged, which could make it more difficult for us to sell our    products to existing and prospective customers and could    adversely affect our operating results.     We have manufacturing processes that utilize a substantial    amount of technology as the fabrication of integrated circuits    is a highly complex and precise process. Minute impurities,    contaminants in the manufacturing environment, difficulties in    the fabrication process, defects in the masks used in the wafer    manufacturing process, manufacturing equipment failures, wafer    breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of    wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be    nonfunctional. While we have significant expertise in    semiconductor manufacturing, it is possible that some processes    could become unstable. This instability could result in    manufacturing delays and product shortages, which could have a    material adverse effect on our operating results. We are    involved in frequent litigation, including regarding    intellectual property rights, which could be costly to bring or    defend and could require us to redesign products or pay    significant royalties.     The semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims    and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property    rights, including claims arising under our contractual    obligations to indemnify our customers. Other companies or    individuals have obtained patents covering a variety of    semiconductor designs and processes, and we might be required to    obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from    making and selling infringing products, if those patents are    found to be valid. From time to time, we receive claims from    third parties asserting that our products or processes infringe    their patents or other intellectual property rights. In the    event a third party makes a valid intellectual property claim    against us and a license is not available to us on commercially    reasonable terms, or at all, we could be forced either to    redesign or to stop production of products incorporating that    intellectual property, and our operating results could be    materially and adversely affected. Litigation may be necessary    to enforce our patents or other of our intellectual property    rights or to defend us against claims of infringement, and this    litigation could be costly and divert the attention of our key    personnel. We could be subject to warranty or product liability    claims that could lead to significant costs and expenses as we    defend those claims or pay damage awards. There can be no    assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all    claims and potential liabilities. We may incur costs and    expenses relating to a recall of our customers products    due to an alleged failure of components we supply. An adverse    outcome in litigation could have a material adverse effect on    our financial position or on our operating results or cash flows    in the period in which the litigation is resolved.    13 We may be    unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights, which may    limit our ability to compete effectively.     Our success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our    intellectual property. We primarily rely on patent, mask work,    copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as    nondisclosure agreements and other methods, to protect our    proprietary technologies and processes. Despite our efforts to    protect our proprietary technologies and processes, it is    possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties    may obtain, copy, use or disclose our technologies, products and    processes. Moreover, the laws of foreign countries in which we    design, manufacture, market and sell our products may afford    little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology.     There can be no assurance that the claims allowed in our issued    patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. In    addition, any of our existing or future patents may be    challenged, invalidated or circumvented. As such, any rights    granted under these patents may not provide us with meaningful    protection. We may not have foreign patents or pending    applications corresponding to our U.S. patents and    applications. Even if foreign patents are granted, effective    enforcement in foreign countries may not be available. If our    patents do not adequately protect our technology, our    competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours. Our    competitors may also be able to develop similar technology    independently or design around our patents.     We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our    employees, consultants and strategic partners. We also try to    control access to and distribution of our technologies,    documentation and other proprietary information. Despite these    efforts, internal or external parties may attempt to copy,    disclose, obtain or use our products or technology without our    authorization. Also, former employees may seek employment with    our business partners, customers or competitors, and there can    be no assurance that the confidential nature of our proprietary    information will be maintained in the course of such future    employment. If we do    not retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our    business strategy will be adversely affected.     Our continued success depends to a significant extent upon the    recruitment, retention and effective succession of our executive    officers and key management and technical personnel,    particularly our experienced engineers. The competition for    these employees is intense. The loss of the services of one or    more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect    on our operating results. In addition, there could be a material    adverse effect on our business should the turnover rates for    engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if    we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel. We do    not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our    officers or employees. To remain    competitive, we may need to acquire other companies, purchase or    license technology from third parties, or enter into other    strategic transactions in order to introduce new products or    enhance our existing products.     An element of our business strategy involves expansion through    the acquisitions of businesses, assets, products or technologies    that allow us to complement our existing product offerings,    expand our market coverage, increase our engineering workforce    or enhance our technological capabilities. We may not be able to    find businesses that have the technology or resources we need    and, if we find such businesses, we may not be able to purchase    or license the technology or resources on commercially favorable    terms or at all. Acquisitions and technology licenses are    difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons,    including the cost of potential transactions, competition among    prospective buyers and licensees, the need for regulatory    approvals, and difficulties related to integration efforts. In    order to finance a potential transaction, we may need to raise    additional funds by issuing securities or borrowing money. We    may not be able to find financing on favorable terms, and the    sale of our stock may result in the dilution of our existing    shareholders or the issuance of securities with rights that are    superior to the rights of our common shareholders.     Acquisitions also involve a number of risks, including:           difficulty integrating acquired technologies, operations and    personnel with our existing businesses;           diversion of management attention in connection with both    negotiating the acquisitions and integrating the assets;    14            strain on managerial and operational resources as management    tries to oversee larger operations;           the future funding requirements for acquired companies, which    may be significant;           potential loss of key employees;           exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired    companies; and           increased risk of costly and time-consuming litigation.     If we are unable to successfully address these risks, we may not    realize some or all of the expected benefits of the acquisition,    which may have an adverse effect on our business plans and    operating results. We rely    on manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable    areas, which could affect the availability of supplies and    services.     We, like many companies in the semiconductor industry, rely on    internal manufacturing capacity, wafer fabrication foundries and    other    sub-contractors    in geologically unstable locations around the world. This    reliance involves risks associated with the impact of    earthquakes on us and the semiconductor industry, including    temporary loss of capacity, availability and cost of key raw    materials, utilities and equipment and availability of key    services, including transport of our products worldwide. Any    prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing    facilities, or those of our subcontractors or third-party wafer    fabrication foundries, as a result of fire, natural disaster,    unavailability of utilities or otherwise, would have a material    adverse effect on our results of operations and financial    condition. We are    exposed to business, economic, political, legal and other risks    through our significant worldwide operations.     We have significant operations and manufacturing facilities    outside the United States, including in Ireland and the    Philippines. During fiscal 2009, approximately 80% of our    revenue was derived from customers in international markets.    Although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce our    exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations, there can be no    assurance that our competitive position will not be adversely    affected by changes in the exchange rate of the United States    dollar against other currencies. Potential interest rate    increases, as well as high energy costs, could have an adverse    impact on industrial and consumer spending patterns and could    adversely impact demand for our products. While a majority of    our cash is generated outside the United States, we require a    substantial amount of cash in the United Sates for operating    requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends and    acquisitions. If we are unable to address our U.S. cash    requirements through operations, by efficient and timely    repatriations of overseas cash, through borrowings under our    current credit facility or from other sources of cash obtained    at an acceptable cost, our business strategies and operating    results could be adversely affected.     In addition to being exposed to the ongoing economic cycles in    the semiconductor industry, we are also subject to the economic,    political and legal risks inherent in international operations,    including the risks associated with the current crisis in global    credit and financial markets, ongoing uncertainties and    political and economic instability in many countries around the    world, as well as economic disruption from acts of terrorism and    the response to them by the United States and its allies. Other    business risks associated with international operations include    increased managerial complexities, air transportation    disruptions, expropriation, currency controls, currency exchange    rate movement, additional costs related to foreign taxes,    tariffs and freight rate increases, exposure to different    business practices and legal standards, particularly with    respect to price protection, intellectual property and    environmental compliance, trade and travel restrictions,    pandemics, import and export license requirements and    restrictions, difficulties in staffing and managing worldwide    operations, and accounts receivable collections.     We expect to continue to expand our business and operations in    China. Our success in the Chinese markets may be adversely    affected by Chinas continuously evolving laws and    regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and    export tariffs, currency controls, environmental regulations,    and intellectual property rights and enforcement of those    rights. Enforcement of existing laws or agreements may be    inconsistent, as there exists a high degree of fragmentation    among regulatory authorities resulting in uncertainties as to    which authorities have jurisdiction over particular parties or    transactions. In addition, changes in the political environment,    governmental    15     policies or    U.S.-China    relations could result in revisions to laws or regulations or    their interpretation and enforcement, increased taxation,    restrictions on imports, import duties or currency revaluations,    which could have an adverse effect on our business plans and    operating results. Our    operating results are dependent on the performance of    independent distributors.     A significant portion of our sales are through independent    distributors that are not under our control. These independent    distributors generally represent product lines offered by    several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts    applied to our products or terminate their representation of us.    We generally do not require letters of credit from our    distributors and are not protected against accounts receivable    default or bankruptcy by these distributors. Our inability to    collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our    operating results. Termination of a significant distributor,    whether at our initiative or the distributors initiative,    could disrupt our current business, and if we are unable to find    suitable replacements, our operating results could be adversely    affected. We are    subject to increasingly strict environmental regulations, which    could increase our expenses and affect our operating    results.     Our industry is subject to increasingly strict environmental    regulations that control and restrict the use, transportation,    emission, discharge, storage and disposal of certain chemicals,    gases and other substances used or produced in the semiconductor    manufacturing process. Public attention on environmental    controls has continued to increase, and our customers routinely    include stringent environmental standards in their contracts    with us. Changes in environmental regulations may require us to    invest in potentially costly pollution control equipment or    alter the way our products are made. In addition, we use    hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks    of strict liability for damages caused by accidental releases,    regardless of fault. Any failure to control such materials    adequately or to comply with regulatory restrictions or    contractual obligations could increase our expenses and    adversely affect our operating results.     New climate change regulations could require us to change our    manufacturing processes or obtain substitute materials that may    cost more or be less available for our manufacturing operations.    In addition, new restrictions on carbon dioxide or other    greenhouse gas emissions could result in significant costs for    us. Greenhouse gas legislation has been introduced in    Massachusetts and the United States legislatures and we expect    increased worldwide regulatory activity in the future. The cost    of complying, or of failing to comply, with these and other    climate change and emissions regulations could have an adverse    effect on our business plans and operating results. If we are    unable to generate sufficient cash flow, we may not be able to    service our debt obligations, including making payments on our    $375 million senior unsecured notes.     In the third quarter of fiscal 2009, we issued in a public    offering $375 million aggregate principal amount of    5.0% senior unsecured notes due July 1, 2014. Our    ability to make payments of principal and interest on our    indebtedness when due depends upon our future performance, which    will be subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles    and financial, business and other factors affecting our    consolidated operations, many of which are beyond our control.    If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from    operations in the future to service our debt, we may be required    to, among other things:           seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets;           refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness,    including the notes;           sell selected assets;           reduce or delay planned capital expenditures; or           reduce or delay planned operating expenditures.     Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service    our debt, including the notes, which could negatively impact our    financial results. In addition, any such financing, refinancing    or sale of assets might not be available on economically    favorable terms.    16 Restrictions    in our credit facility and outstanding debt instruments may    limit our activities.     Our current credit facility and our 5.0% senior unsecured    notes impose, and future debt instruments to which we may become    subject may impose, restrictions that limit our ability to    engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company,    including to undertake certain transactions, to create certain    liens on our assets and to incur certain subsidiary    indebtedness. Our ability to comply with these financial    restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future    performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions    and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control    such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, changes in    technology and changes in the level of competition. In addition,    our credit facility requires us to maintain compliance with    specified financial ratios. If we breach any of the covenants    under our credit facility or the indenture governing our    outstanding notes and do not obtain appropriate waivers, then,    subject to applicable cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness    thereunder could be declared immediately due and payable. Our stock    price may be volatile.     The market price of our common stock has been volatile in the    past and may be volatile in the future, as it may be    significantly affected by the following factors:           crises in global credit and financial markets;           actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and operating    results;           changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or our    failure to perform in line with those estimates or our published    guidance;           changes in market valuations of other semiconductor companies;           announcements by us or our competitors of significant new    products, technical innovations, acquisitions or dispositions,    litigation or capital commitments;           departures of key personnel;           actual or perceived noncompliance with corporate responsibility    or ethics standards by us or any of our employees, officers or    directors; and           negative media publicity targeting us or our competitors.     The stock market has historically experienced volatility,    especially within the semiconductor industry, that often has    been unrelated to the performance of particular companies. These    market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless    of our operating results"
15,ADI,ANALOG DEVICES,2008-11-25,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS"" --> ITEM 1A.  RISK    FACTORS     Set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other    documents we file with the SEC are descriptions of the risks and    uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ    materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking    statements contained in this report. Our    future revenue, gross margins, operating results and net income    are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate.     Our future revenue, gross margins, operating results and net    income are difficult to predict and may be materially affected    by a number of factors, including:           the effects of adverse economic conditions in the United States    and international markets, including the current crisis in    global credit and financial markets;           changes in customer demand for our products and for end products    that incorporate our products;           the effectiveness of our efforts to refocus our operations and    reduce our cost structure;           the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us,    our customers or our competitors;           competitive pricing pressures;           fluctuations in manufacturing yields, adequate availability of    wafers and other raw materials, and manufacturing, assembly and    test capacity;           any significant decline in our backlog;           the timing, delay or cancellation of significant customer orders    and our ability to manage inventory;           our ability to hire, retain and motivate adequate numbers of    engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of    our customers;           changes in geographic, product or customer mix;           our ability to utilize our manufacturing facilities at efficient    levels;           potential significant litigation-related costs;           the difficulties inherent in forecasting future operating    expense levels, including with respect to costs associated with    labor, utilities, transportation and raw materials;           the costs related to compliance with increasing worldwide    environmental regulations;           changes in our effective tax rates in the United States, Ireland    or worldwide; and           the effects of public health emergencies, natural disasters,    security risks, terrorist activities, international conflicts    and other events beyond our control.     In addition, the semiconductor market has historically been    cyclical and subject to significant economic upturns and    downturns. Our business is subject to rapid technological    changes and there can be no assurance, depending on the mix of    future business, that products stocked in our inventory will not    be rendered obsolete before we ship them. As a result of these    and other factors, there can be no assurance that we will not    experience material fluctuations in future revenue, gross    margins, operating results and net income on a quarterly or    annual basis. In addition, if our revenue, gross margins,    operating results and net income do not meet the expectations of    securities analysts or investors, the market price of our common    stock may decline. Long-term    contracts are not typical for us and reductions, cancellations    or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our    operating results.     We typically do not have long-term sales contracts with our    customers. In certain markets where end-user demand may be    particularly volatile and difficult to predict, some customers    place orders that require us to manufacture product and have it    available for shipment, even though the customer is unwilling to    make a binding    9Table of Contents    commitment to purchase all, or even any, of the product. In    other instances, we manufacture product based on forecasts of    customer demands. As a result, we may incur inventory and    manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales and are    subject to the risk of cancellations of orders, leading to a    sharp reduction of sales and backlog. Further, orders or    forecasts may be for products that meet the customers    unique requirements so that those cancelled or unrealized orders    would, in addition, result in an inventory of unsaleable    products, resulting in potential inventory write-offs. As a    result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for certain of the    products that are subject to these uncertainties, the amount of    unsaleable product could be substantial. Incorrect forecasts, or    reductions, cancellations or delays in orders for our products    could adversely affect our operating results. The    current crisis in global credit and financial markets could    materially and adversely affect our business and results of    operations.     As widely reported, global credit and financial markets have    been experiencing extreme disruptions in recent months,    including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability,    declines in consumer confidence, declines in economic growth,    increases in unemployment rates, and uncertainty about economic    stability. There can be no assurance that there will not be    further deterioration in credit and financial markets and    confidence in economic conditions. These economic uncertainties    affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways, making it    difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business    activities. The current tightening of credit in financial    markets may lead consumers and businesses to postpone spending,    which may cause our customers to cancel, decrease or delay their    existing and future orders with us. In addition, financial    difficulties experienced by our suppliers or distributors could    result in product delays, increased accounts receivable defaults    and inventory challenges. The volatility in the credit markets    has severely diminished liquidity and capital availability. We    are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the    current disruptions in the credit and financial markets and    adverse global economic conditions, and if the current uncertain    economic conditions continue or further deteriorate, our    business and results of operations could be materially and    adversely affected. Our    future success depends upon our ability to continue to innovate,    improve our products, develop and market new products, and    identify and enter new markets.     Our success significantly depends on our continued ability to    improve our products and develop and market innovative new    products. Product development, innovation and enhancement is    often a complex, time-consuming and costly process involving    significant investment in research and development, with no    assurance of return on investment. There can be no assurance    that we will be able to develop and introduce new and improved    products in a timely or efficient manner or that new and    improved products, if developed, will achieve market acceptance.    Our products generally must conform to various evolving and    sometimes competing industry standards, which may adversely    affect our ability to compete in certain markets or require us    to incur significant costs. In addition, our customers generally    impose very high quality and reliability standards on our    products, which often change and may be difficult or costly to    satisfy. Any inability to satisfy such customer quality    standards or comply with industry standards and technical    requirements may adversely affect demand for our products and    our results of operations. In addition, our growth is dependent    on our continued ability to identify and penetrate new markets    where we have limited experience and competition is intense.    Also, some of our customers in these markets are less    established, which could subject us to increased credit risk.    There can be no assurance that the markets we serve will grow in    the future, that our existing and new products will meet the    requirements of these markets, that our products will achieve    customer acceptance in these markets, that competitors will not    force price reductions or take market share from us, or that we    can achieve or maintain adequate gross margins or profits in    these markets. Furthermore, a decline in demand in one or    several of our end-user markets could have a material adverse    effect on the demand for our products and our results of    operations. We may    not be able to compete successfully in markets within the    semiconductor industry in the future.     We face intense technological and pricing competition in the    semiconductor industry, and we expect such competition to    increase in the future. Many other companies offer products that    compete with our products. Some have greater financial,    manufacturing, technical and marketing resources than we have.    Some of our competitors may have better established supply or    development relationships with our current and potential    customers or    10Table of Contents    suppliers. Our competitors also include emerging companies    selling specialized products in markets we serve. Competition is    generally based on design and quality of products, product    performance, features and functionality, and product pricing,    availability and capacity, with the relative importance of these    factors varying among products, markets and customers. Existing    or new competitors may develop products or technologies that    more effectively address the demands of our customers and    markets with enhanced performance, features and functionality,    lower power requirements, greater levels of integration or lower    cost. Increased competition in certain markets has resulted in    and may continue to result in declining average selling prices,    reduced gross margins and loss of market share in such markets.    There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete    successfully in the future against existing or new competitors,    or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by    increased competition. We rely    on third-party subcontractors and manufacturers for some    industry-standard wafers and assembly and test services, and    generally cannot control their availability or conditions of    supply.     We rely, and plan to continue to rely, on assembly and test    subcontractors and on third-party wafer fabricators to supply    most of our wafers that can be manufactured using    industry-standard submicron processes. This reliance involves    several risks, including reduced control over availability,    capacity utilization, delivery schedules, manufacturing yields,    quality assurance and costs. Additionally, we utilize a limited    number of third-party wafer fabricators, primarily Taiwan    Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. These suppliers manufacture    components in accordance with our proprietary designs and    specifications. In addition, these suppliers often provide    manufacturing services to our competitors and therefore periods    of increased industry demand may result in capacity constraints.    If these suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and    deliver sufficient quantities of components to us on the time    schedule and of the quality that we require, we may be forced to    seek to engage additional or replacement suppliers, which could    result in additional expenses and delays in product development    or shipment of product to our customers. Approximately 44% of    our fiscal 2008 revenue was from products fabricated at    third-party wafer-fabrication facilities, primarily TSMC. The    markets for semiconductor products are cyclical, and we may not    be able to satisfy sufficiently the demand for our products,    while increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower    prices.     The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted    in periods when demand for our products has increased or    decreased rapidly. During periods of rapid increases in demand,    our available capacity may not be sufficient to satisfy the    demand. In addition, we may not be able to expand our workforce    and operations in a sufficiently timely manner, procure adequate    resources, or locate suitable third-party suppliers, to respond    effectively to changes in demand for our existing products or to    the demand for new products requested by our customers, and our    current or future business could be materially and adversely    affected. Conversely, if we expand our operations and workforce    too rapidly or procure excessive resources in anticipation of    increased demand for our products, and such demand does not    materialize at the pace at which we expect, or declines, our    operating results may be adversely affected as a result of    increased operating expenses, reduced margins, underutilization    of capacity or asset impairment charges. These capacity    expansions by us and other semiconductor manufacturers could    also lead to overcapacity in our target markets which could lead    to price erosion that would adversely impact our operating    results. Our    semiconductor products are complex and we may be subject to    product warranty and indemnity claims, which could result in    significant costs and damage to our reputation and adversely    affect the market acceptance of our products.     Semiconductor products are highly complex and may contain    defects when they are first introduced or as new versions are    developed. We generally warrant our products to our customers    for one year from the date title passes from us. We invest    significant resources in the testing of our products; however,    if any of our products contain defects, we may be required to    incur additional development and remediation costs, pursuant to    warranty and indemnification provisions in our customer    contracts and purchase orders. These problems may divert our    technical and other resources from other product development    efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers    or others, including liability for costs associated with product    recalls, which may adversely impact our operating results. We    may also be subject to customer indemnity claims. Our customers    have on occasion been sued, and may    11Table of Contents    in the future be sued by third parties with respect to    infringement or other product matters, and those customers may    seek indemnification from us under the terms and conditions of    our sales contracts with them. In certain cases, our potential    indemnification liability may be significant. There can be no    assurance that we are adequately insured to protect against all    claims and potential liabilities. If any of our products    contains defects, or has reliability, quality or compatibility    problems, our reputation may be damaged, which could make it    more difficult for us to sell our products to existing and    prospective customers and could adversely affect our operating    results.     We have manufacturing processes that utilize a substantial    amount of technology as the fabrication of integrated circuits    is a highly complex and precise process. Minute impurities,    contaminants in the manufacturing environment, difficulties in    the fabrication process, defects in the masks used in the wafer    manufacturing process, manufacturing equipment failures, wafer    breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of    wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be    nonfunctional. While we have significant expertise in    semiconductor manufacturing, it is possible that some processes    could become unstable. This instability could result in    manufacturing delays and product shortages, which could have a    material adverse effect on our operating results. We may be    unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights, which may    limit our ability to compete effectively.     Our success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our    intellectual property. We primarily rely on patent, mask work,    copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as    nondisclosure agreements and other methods, to protect our    proprietary technologies and processes. Despite our efforts to    protect our proprietary technologies and processes, it is    possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties    may obtain, copy, use or disclose our technologies and    processes. Moreover, the laws of foreign countries in which we    design, manufacture, market and sell our products may afford    little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology.     There can be no assurance that the claims allowed in our issued    patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. In    addition, any of our existing or future patents may be    challenged, invalidated or circumvented. As such, any rights    granted under these patents may not provide us with meaningful    protection. We may not have foreign patents or pending    applications corresponding to our U.S. patents and    applications. Even if foreign patents are granted, effective    enforcement in foreign countries may not be available. If our    patents do not adequately protect our technology, our    competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours. Our    competitors may also be able to develop similar technology    independently or design around our patents. Other companies or    individuals have obtained patents covering a variety of    semiconductor designs and processes, and we might be required to    obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from    making and selling the infringing products, if such patents are    found to be valid. There can be no assurance that we would be    able to obtain licenses, if required, upon commercially    reasonable terms, or at all.     We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our    employees, consultants and strategic partners. We also try to    control access to and distribution of our technologies,    documentation and other proprietary information. Despite these    efforts, internal or external parties may attempt to copy,    disclose, obtain or use our products or technology without our    authorization. Also, former employees may seek employment with    our business partners, customers or competitors, and there can    be no assurance that the confidential nature of our proprietary    information will be maintained in the course of such future    employment. We are    involved in frequent litigation, including regarding    intellectual property rights, which could be costly to bring or    defend and could require us to redesign products or pay    significant royalties.     The semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims    and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property    rights, including claims arising under our contractual    obligations to indemnify our customers. From time to time, we    receive claims from third parties asserting that our products or    processes infringe their patents or other intellectual property    rights. In the event a third party makes a valid intellectual    property claim against us and a license is not available to us    on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, we could be forced    either to redesign or to stop production of products    incorporating that intellectual property, and our operating    results could be materially and adversely affected. Litigation    may be necessary to enforce our patents or other of our    intellectual    12Table of Contents    property rights or to defend us against claims of infringement,    and this litigation could be costly and divert the attention of    our key personnel. We could be subject to warranty or product    liability claims that could lead to significant costs and    expenses as we defend such claims or pay damage awards. There    can be no assurance that we are adequately insured to protect    against all claims and potential liabilities. We may incur costs    and expenses relating to a recall of our customers    products due to an alleged failure of components we supply. See    Note 12 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements    contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on    Form 10-K    for information concerning certain litigation that involves us.    An adverse outcome in litigation could have a material adverse    effect on our financial position or on our operating results or    cash flows in the period in which the litigation is resolved. If we do    not retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our    business strategy will be adversely affected.     Our continued success depends to a significant extent upon the    recruitment, retention and effective succession of our executive    officers and key management and technical personnel,    particularly our experienced engineers. The competition for    these employees is intense. The loss of the services of one or    more of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect    on our operating results. In addition, there could be a material    adverse effect on our business should the turnover rates for    engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or if    we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel. We do    not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of our    officers or employees. To remain    competitive, we may need to acquire other companies, purchase or    license technology from third parties, or enter into other    strategic transactions in order to introduce new products or    enhance our existing products.     An element of our business strategy involves expansion through    the acquisitions of businesses, assets, products or technologies    that allow us to complement our existing product offerings,    expand our market coverage, increase our engineering workforce    or enhance our technological capabilities. We may not be able to    find businesses that have the technology or resources we need    and, if we find such businesses, we may not be able to purchase    or license the technology or resources on commercially favorable    terms or at all. Acquisitions and technology licenses are    difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons,    including the cost of potential transactions, competition among    prospective buyers and licensees, the need for regulatory    approvals, and difficulties related to integration efforts. In    order to finance a potential transaction, we may need to raise    additional funds by issuing securities or borrowing money. We    may not be able to find financing on favorable terms, and the    sale of our stock may result in the dilution of our existing    shareholders or the issuance of securities with rights that are    superior to the rights of our common shareholders. Our current    credit facility imposes restrictions on our ability to undertake    certain transactions, to create certain liens on our assets and    to incur certain subsidiary indebtedness, and requires us to    maintain compliance with specified financial ratios. If we    breach any of the covenants under our credit facility and do not    obtain a waiver from the lenders, then, subject to applicable    cure periods, our outstanding indebtedness thereunder could be    declared immediately due and payable.     Acquisitions also involve a number of risks, including:           difficulty integrating acquired technologies, operations and    personnel with our existing businesses;           diversion of management attention in connection with both    negotiating the acquisitions and integrating the assets;           strain on managerial and operational resources as management    tries to oversee larger operations;           the future funding requirements for acquired companies, which    may be significant;           potential loss of key employees;           exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired    companies; and           increased risk of costly and time-consuming litigation.    13Table of Contents     If we are unable to successfully address these risks, we may not    realize some or all of the expected benefits of the acquisition,    which may have an adverse effect on our business plans and    operating results. We rely    on manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable    areas, which could affect the availability of supplies and    services.     We, like many companies in the semiconductor industry, rely on    internal manufacturing capacity, wafer fabrication foundries and    other    sub-contractors    in geologically unstable locations around the world. This    reliance involves risks associated with the impact of    earthquakes on us and the semiconductor industry, including    temporary loss of capacity, availability and cost of key raw    materials, utilities and equipment and availability of key    services, including transport of our products worldwide. Any    prolonged inability to utilize one of our manufacturing    facilities, or those of our subcontractors or third-party wafer    fabrication foundries, as a result of fire, natural disaster,    unavailability of utilities or otherwise, would have a material    adverse effect on our results of operations and financial    condition. We are    exposed to business, economic, political, legal and other risks    through our significant worldwide operations.     We have significant operations and manufacturing facilities    outside the United States, including in Ireland and the    Philippines. During fiscal 2008, approximately 80% of our    product revenue was derived from customers in international    markets. Although we engage in hedging transactions to reduce    our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations, there can    be no assurance that our competitive position will not be    adversely affected by changes in the exchange rate of the United    States dollar against other currencies. Potential interest rate    increases, as well as high energy costs, could have an adverse    impact on industrial and consumer spending patterns and could    adversely impact demand for our products. While a majority of    our cash is generated outside the United States, we require a    substantial amount of cash in the United Sates for operating    requirements, stock repurchases, cash dividends and    acquisitions. If we are unable to address our U.S. cash    requirements through operations, by efficient and timely    repatriations of overseas cash, through borrowings under our    current credit facility or from other sources of cash obtained    at an acceptable cost, our business strategies and operating    results could be adversely affected.     In addition to being exposed to the ongoing economic cycles in    the semiconductor industry, we are also subject to the economic,    political and legal risks inherent in international operations,    including the risks associated with the current crisis in global    credit and financial markets, ongoing uncertainties and    political and economic instability in many countries around the    world, as well as the economic disruption from acts of terrorism    and the response to them by the United States and its allies.    Other business risks associated with international operations    include increased managerial complexities, air transportation    disruptions, expropriation, currency controls, currency exchange    rate movement, additional costs related to foreign taxes,    tariffs and freight rate increases, exposure to different    business practices and legal standards, particularly with    respect to price protection, intellectual property and    environmental compliance, trade and travel restrictions,    pandemics, import and export license requirements and    restrictions, difficulties in staffing and managing worldwide    operations, and accounts receivable collections.     We expect to continue to expand our business and operations in    China. Our success in the Chinese markets may be adversely    affected by Chinas continuously evolving laws and    regulations, including those relating to taxation, import and    export tariffs, currency controls, environmental regulations,    and property rights. Enforcement of existing laws or agreements    may be inconsistent, as there exists a high degree of    fragmentation among regulatory authorities resulting in    uncertainties as to which authorities have jurisdiction over    particular parties or transactions. In addition, changes in the    political environment, governmental policies or    U.S.-China    relations could result in revisions to laws or regulations or    their interpretation and enforcement, increased taxation,    restrictions on imports, import duties or currency revaluations,    which could have an adverse effect on our business plans and    operating results. Our    operating results are dependent on the performance of    independent distributors.     A significant portion of our sales are through independent    distributors that are not under our control. These independent    distributors generally represent product lines offered by    several companies and thus could reduce their    14Table of Contents    sales efforts applied to our products or terminate their    representation of us. We generally do not require letters of    credit from our distributors and are not protected against    accounts receivable default or bankruptcy by these distributors.    Our inability to collect open accounts receivable could    adversely affect our operating results. Termination of a    significant distributor, whether at our initiative or the    distributors initiative, could disrupt our current    business, and if we are unable to find suitable replacements,    our operating results could be adversely affected. We are    subject to increasingly strict environmental regulations, which    could increase our expenses and affect our operating    results.     Our industry is subject to increasingly strict environmental    regulations that control and restrict the use, transportation,    emission, discharge, storage and disposal of certain chemicals,    gases and other substances used or produced in the semiconductor    manufacturing process. Public attention on environmental    controls has increased, and our customers routinely include    stringent environmental standards in their contracts with us.    Changes in environmental regulations may require us to invest in    potentially costly remediation equipment or alter the way our    products are made. In addition, we use hazardous and other    regulated materials that subject us to risks of strict liability    for damages caused by accidental releases, regardless of fault.    Any failure to control such materials adequately or to comply    with regulatory restrictions or contractual obligations could    increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results.     New climate change regulations could require us to change our    manufacturing processes or obtain substitute materials that may    cost more or be less available for our manufacturing operations.    In addition, new restrictions on carbon dioxide or other    greenhouse gas emissions could result in significant costs for    us. Greenhouse gas legislation has been introduced in    Massachusetts and the United States legislatures and we expect    increased worldwide regulatory activity in the future. The cost    of complying, or of failing to comply, with these and other    climate change and emissions regulations could have an adverse    effect on our business plans and operating results. Our stock    price may be volatile.     The market price of our common stock has been volatile in the    past and may be volatile in the future, as it may be    significantly affected by the following factors:           actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and operating    results;           the current crisis in global credit and financial markets;           changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or our    failure to perform in line with such estimates or our published    guidance;           changes in market valuations of other semiconductor companies;           announcements by us or our competitors of significant new    products, technical innovations, acquisitions or dispositions,    litigation or capital commitments;           departures of key personnel;           actual or perceived noncompliance with corporate responsibility    or ethics standards by us or any of our employees, officers or    directors; and           negative media publicity targeting us or our competitors.     The stock market has historically experienced volatility,    especially within the semiconductor industry, that often has    been unrelated to the performance of particular companies. These    market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless    of our operating results"

RISK FACTORS"" --> ITEM 1A.  RISK    FACTORS     Set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other    documents we file with the SEC are descriptions of the risks and    uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ    materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking    statements contained in this report. Our    future revenue, gross margins, operating results and net income    are difficult to predict and may materially fluctuate.     Our future revenue, gross margins, operating results and net    income are difficult to predict and may be materially affected    by a number of factors, including:           changes in customer demand for our products and for end products    that incorporate our products;           the timing of new product announcements or introductions by us,    our customers or our competitors;           competitive pricing pressures;           fluctuations in manufacturing yields, adequate availability of    wafers and other raw materials, and manufacturing, assembly and    test capacity;           the risk that our backlog could decline significantly;           the timing, delay or cancellation of significant customer orders    and our ability to manage inventory;           our ability to hire, retain and motivate adequate numbers of    engineers and other qualified employees to meet the demands of    our customers;           changes in geographic, product or customer mix;           potential significant litigation-related costs;           the difficulties inherent in forecasting future operating    expense levels;           the costs related to compliance with increasing worldwide    environmental regulations;           changes in our effective tax rate;           the effect of adverse changes in economic conditions in the    United States and international markets; and           the effects of public health emergencies, natural disasters,    terrorist activities, international conflicts and other events    beyond our control.     In addition, the semiconductor market has historically been    cyclical and subject to significant economic downturns. Our    business is subject to rapid technological changes and there can    be no assurance, depending on the mix of future business, that    products stocked in inventory will not be rendered obsolete    before we ship them. As a result of these and other factors,    there can be no assurance that we will not experience material    fluctuations in future revenue, gross margins and operating    results on a quarterly or annual basis. In addition, if our    revenue, gross margins, operating results and net income do not    meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the    market price of our common stock may decline. Long-term    contracts are not typical for us and reductions, cancellations    or delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our    operating results.     In certain markets where end-user demand may be particularly    volatile and difficult to predict, some customers place orders    that require us to manufacture product and have it available for    shipment, even though the customer is unwilling to make a    binding commitment to purchase all, or even any, of the product.    At any given time, this situation could affect a portion of our    backlog. As a result, we may incur inventory and manufacturing    costs in advance of anticipated sales and are subject to the    risk of cancellations of orders leading to a sharp reduction of    sales and backlog. Further, those orders may be for products    that meet the customers unique requirements so that those    cancelled orders would, in addition, result in an inventory of    unsaleable products, resulting in potential inventory    10Table of Contents    write-offs. As a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for    certain of the products that are subject to these uncertainties,    the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial.    Reductions, cancellations or delays in orders for our products    could adversely affect our operating results. Our    future success depends upon our ability to continue to improve    our products, develop and market new products, and identify and    enter new markets.     Our success significantly depends on our continued ability to    improve our products and develop and market new products.    Product development and enhancement is often a complex,    time-consuming and costly process involving significant    investment in research and development. There can be no    assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new and    improved products in a timely or efficient manner or that new    and improved products, if developed, will achieve market    acceptance. Our products generally must conform to various    evolving and sometimes competing industry standards, which may    adversely affect our ability to compete in certain markets or    require us to incur significant costs. In addition, our    customers generally impose very high quality and reliability    standards on our products, which often change and may be    difficult or costly to satisfy. Any inability to satisfy such    customer quality standards or comply with industry standards and    technical requirements may adversely affect demand for our    products and our results of operations. In addition, our growth    is dependent on our continued ability to identify and penetrate    new markets where we have limited experience and competition is    intense. There can be no assurance that the markets we serve    will grow in the future, that our existing and new products will    meet the requirements of these markets, that our products will    achieve customer acceptance in these markets, that competitors    will not force prices to an unacceptably low level or take    market share from us, or that we can achieve or maintain profits    in these markets. Furthermore, a decline in demand in one or    several of our end-user markets could have a material adverse    effect on the demand for our products and our results of    operations. Also, some of our customers in these markets are    less established, which could subject us to increased credit    risk. We may    not be able to compete successfully in markets within the    semiconductor industry in the future.     Many other companies offer products that compete with our    products. Some have greater financial, manufacturing, technical    and marketing resources than we have. Some of our competitors    may have better established supply or development relationships    with our current and potential customers. Additionally, some    formerly independent competitors have been purchased by larger    companies. Our competitors also include emerging companies    selling specialized products in markets we serve. Competition is    based on design and quality of products, product performance,    features and functionality, and price, with the relative    importance of these factors varying among products, markets and    customers. Existing or new competitors may develop products or    technologies that more effectively address the demands of our    customers and markets with enhanced features and functionality,    lower power requirements, greater levels of integration or lower    cost. Increased competition in certain markets has resulted in    and may continue to result in declining average selling prices,    reduced gross margins and loss of market share in such markets.    There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete    successfully in the future against existing or new competitors,    or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by    increased price competition. We rely    on third-party subcontractors and manufacturers for some    industry-standard wafers and assembly and test services, and    therefore cannot control their availability or conditions of    supply.     We rely, and plan to continue to rely, on assembly and test    subcontractors and on third-party wafer fabricators to supply    most of our wafers that can be manufactured using    industry-standard submicron processes. This reliance involves    several risks, including reduced control over availability,    capacity utilization, delivery schedules, manufacturing yields,    quality assurance and costs. Additionally, we utilize a limited    number of third-party wafer fabricators, primarily Taiwan    Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. These suppliers manufacture    components in accordance with our proprietary designs and    specifications. We have no written supply agreements with these    suppliers and purchase our custom components through individual    purchase orders. In addition, these suppliers often provide    manufacturing services to our competitors and therefore periods    of increased industry demand may result in capacity constraints.    If these suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and    deliver sufficient quantities of components to us on the time    schedule and of the quality that we require, we may be forced to    seek to    11Table of Contents    engage additional or replacement suppliers, which could result    in additional expenses and delays in product development or    shipment of product to our customers. We may    not be able to satisfy increasing demand for our products, and    increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower    prices.     The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted    in sustained and short-term periods when demand for our products    has increased or decreased rapidly. During these periods of    rapid increases in demand, our available capacity may not be    sufficient to satisfy the available demand. In addition, we may    not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a    sufficiently timely manner, procure adequate resources, or    locate suitable third-party suppliers, to respond effectively to    changes in demand for our existing products or to the demand for    new products requested by our customers, and our current or    future business could be materially and adversely affected.    Conversely, if we expand our operations and workforce too    rapidly or procure excessive resources in anticipation of    increased demand for our products, and such demand does not    materialize at the pace at which we expect, our operating    results may be adversely affected. These capacity expansions by    us and other semiconductor manufacturers could also lead to    overcapacity in our target markets which could lead to price    erosion that would adversely impact our operating results. Our    revenue may not increase enough to offset the expense of    additional capacity.     We, and the semiconductor industry generally, expand production    facilities and access to third-party foundries in response to    periods of increased demand which can cause operating expenses    to increase. Should customer demand fail to increase or should    we enter a period of reduced customer demand, our financial    position and results of operations could be adversely impacted    as a result of increased operating expenses, reduced margins,    underutilization of capacity or asset impairment charges. Our    semiconductor products are complex and may contain undetected    defects which could result in significant costs, claims and    damage to our reputation, and adversely affect the market    acceptance of our products.     Semiconductor products are highly complex and may contain    undetected defects when they are first introduced or as new    versions are developed. We invest significant resources in the    testing of our products; however, if any of our products contain    defects, we may be required to incur additional development and    remediation costs, pursuant to warranty and indemnification    provisions in our customer contracts. These problems may divert    our technical and other resources from other product development    efforts and could result in claims against us by our customers    or others, including liability for costs associated with product    recalls. If any of our products contains defects, or has    reliability, quality or compatibility problems, our reputation    may be damaged, which could make it more difficult for us to    sell our products to existing and prospective customers and    could adversely affect our operating results. We may be    unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights, which may    limit our ability to compete effectively.     Our success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our    intellectual property. We primarily rely on patent, mask work,    copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as    nondisclosure agreements and other methods, to protect our    proprietary technologies and processes. Despite our efforts to    protect our proprietary technologies and processes, it is    possible that competitors or other unauthorized third parties    may obtain, copy, use or disclose our technologies and    processes. Moreover, the laws of foreign countries in which we    design, manufacture, market and sell our products may afford    little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology.     There can be no assurance that the claims allowed in our issued    patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. In    addition, any of our existing or future patents may be    challenged, invalidated or circumvented. As such, any rights    granted under these patents may not provide us with meaningful    protection. We may not have foreign patents or pending    applications corresponding to our U.S. patents and    applications. Even if foreign patents are granted, effective    enforcement in foreign countries may not be available. If our    patents do not adequately protect our technology, our    competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours. Our    competitors may also be able to    12Table of Contents    develop similar technology independently or design around our    patents. Other companies or individuals have obtained patents    covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes, and    we might be required to obtain licenses under some of these    patents or be precluded from making and selling the infringing    products, if such patents are found to be valid. There can be no    assurance that we would be able to obtain licenses, if required,    upon commercially reasonable terms, or at all.     We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our    employees, consultants and strategic partners. We also try to    control access to and distribution of our technologies,    documentation and other proprietary information. Despite these    efforts, internal or external parties may attempt to copy,    disclose, obtain or use our products, services or technology    without our authorization. Also, former employees may seek    employment with our business partners, customers or competitors,    and there can be no assurance that the confidential nature of    our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of    such future employment. We are    involved in frequent litigation, including regarding    intellectual property rights, which could be costly to bring or    defend and could require us to redesign products or pay    significant royalties.     The semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims    and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property    rights, including claims arising under our contractual    obligations to indemnify our customers. We have received from    time to time, and may receive in the future, claims from third    parties asserting that our products or processes infringe their    patents or other intellectual property rights. In the event a    third party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us    and a license is not available to us on commercially reasonable    terms, or at all, we could be forced either to redesign or to    stop production of products incorporating that intellectual    property, and our operating results could be materially and    adversely affected. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our    patents or other of our intellectual property rights or to    defend us against claims of infringement, and this litigation    could be costly and divert the attention of our key personnel.    We could be subject to warranty or product liability claims that    could lead to significant costs and expenses as we defend such    claims or pay damage awards. While we maintain product liability    insurance, there can be no assurance that such insurance will be    available or adequate to protect against all such claims. We may    incur costs and expenses relating to a recall of one of our    customers products containing one of our products. See    Note 12 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial    Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on    Form 10-K    for information concerning certain pending litigation that    involves us. An adverse outcome in these matters or other    litigation could have a material adverse effect on our    consolidated financial position or on our consolidated results    of operations or cash flows in the period in which the    litigation is resolved. If we do    not retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our    business strategy will be limited.     Our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued    service of our executive officers and key management and    technical personnel, particularly our experienced engineers, and    on our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate    qualified personnel. The competition for these employees is    intense. The loss of the services of one or more of our key    personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating    results. In addition, there could be a material adverse effect    on our business should the turnover rates for engineers and    other key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable    to continue to attract qualified personnel. We do not maintain    any key person life insurance policy on any of our officers or    employees. To remain    competitive, we may need to acquire other companies or purchase    or license technology from third parties in order to introduce    new products and services or enhance our existing products and    services.     An element of our business strategy involves expansion through    the acquisitions of businesses, assets, products or technologies    that allow us to complement our existing product offerings,    expand our market coverage, increase our engineering workforce    or enhance our technological capabilities. We may not be able to    find businesses that have the technology or resources we need    and, if we find such businesses, may not be able to purchase or    license the technology or resources on commercially favorable    terms or at all. Acquisitions and technology licenses are    difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons,    including the cost of potential transactions, competition among    prospective buyers and licensees and the need for regulatory    approvals. In order to finance a potential transaction, we may    need to raise additional funds by selling our stock or borrowing    money. We may not be able to    13Table of Contents    find financing on favorable terms, and the sale of our stock may    result in the dilution of our existing shareholders or the    issuance of securities with rights that are superior to the    rights of our common stockholders. Acquisitions also involve a    number of risks, including:           difficulty integrating acquired technologies, operations and    personnel with our existing businesses;           diversion of management attention in connection with both    negotiating the acquisitions and integrating the assets;           strain on managerial and operational resources as management    tries to oversee larger operations;           the future funding requirements for acquired companies, which    may be significant;           potential loss of key employees;           exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired    companies; and           increased risk of costly and time-consuming litigation.     If we are unable to successfully address these risks, we may not    realize some or all of the expected benefits of the acquisition,    which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of    operations. We rely    on manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable    areas, which could affect the availability of supplies and    services.     We, and many companies in the semiconductor industry, rely on    internal manufacturing capacity, wafer fabrication foundries and    other sub-contractors in geologically unstable locations around    the world. This reliance involves risks associated with the    impact of earthquakes on us and the semiconductor industry,    including temporary loss of capacity, availability and cost of    key raw materials and equipment and availability of key services    including transport of our products worldwide. Any prolonged    inability to utilize one of our manufacturing facilities, or    those of our subcontractors or third party wafer-fabrication    foundries, as a result of fire, natural disaster, unavailability    of electric power or otherwise, would have a material adverse    effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We are    exposed to business, economic, political and other risks through    our significant worldwide operations.     During fiscal 2007, approximately 74% of our product revenue was    derived from customers in international markets. Although we    engage in hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to    currency exchange rate fluctuations, there can be no assurance    that our competitive position will not be adversely affected by    changes in the exchange rate of the United States dollar against    other currencies. Potential interest rate increases, as well as    high energy costs could have an adverse impact on industrial and    consumer spending patterns and could adversely impact demand for    our products. We have manufacturing facilities outside the    United States in Ireland and the Philippines. In addition to    being exposed to the ongoing economic cycles in the    semiconductor industry, we are also subject to the economic and    political risks inherent in international operations and their    impact on the United States economy in general, including the    risks associated with ongoing uncertainties and political and    economic instability in many countries around the world as well    as the economic disruption from acts of terrorism, and the    response to them by the United States and its allies. Other    business risks associated with international operations include    increased managerial complexities, air transportation    disruptions, expropriation, currency controls, currency exchange    rate movement, additional costs related to foreign taxes,    tariffs and freight rate increases, exposure to different    business practices and legal standards, particularly with    respect to price protection and intellectual property, trade and    travel restrictions, pandemics, import and export license    requirements and restrictions, difficulties in staffing and    managing worldwide operations, and accounts receivable    collections. Our    future operating results are dependent on the performance of    independent distributors.     A significant portion of our sales are through independent    distributors that are not under our control. These independent    distributors generally represent product lines offered by    several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts    applied to our products or terminate their representation of us.    We generally do not require letters of    14Table of Contents    credit from our distributors and are not protected against    accounts receivable default or bankruptcy by these distributors.    Our inability to collect open accounts receivable could    adversely affect our results of operations. Termination of a    significant distributor, whether at our initiative or the    distributors initiative, could disrupt our current    business. If we are unable to find suitable replacements in the    event of terminations by significant distributors our operating    results could be adversely affected. We are    subject to increasingly strict environmental regulations, which    could increase our expenses and affect our operating    results.     Our industry is subject to environmental regulations that    control and restrict the use, transportation, emission,    discharge, storage and disposal of certain chemicals used in the    manufacturing process. Public attention on environmental    controls has increased, and changes in environmental regulations    might require us to invest in costly remediation equipment or    alter the way our products are made. In addition, we use    hazardous and other regulated materials that subject us to risks    of liability for damages caused by accidental releases,    regardless of fault. Any failure to control such materials    adequately or to comply with regulatory restrictions could    increase our expenses and adversely affect our operating results. Our    manufacturing processes are highly complex and may be    interrupted.     We have manufacturing processes that utilize a substantial    amount of technology as the fabrication of integrated circuits    is a highly complex and precise process. Minute impurities,    contaminants in the manufacturing environment, difficulties in    the fabrication process, defects in the masks used in the wafer    manufacturing process, manufacturing equipment failures, wafer    breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of    wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be    nonfunctional. While we have significant expertise in    semiconductor manufacturing, it is possible that some processes    could become unstable. This instability could result in    manufacturing delays and product shortages, which could have a    material adverse effect on our financial position or results of    operations. Our stock    price may be volatile.     The market price of our common stock has been volatile in the    past and may be volatile in the future, as it may be    significantly affected by the following factors:           actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and operating    results;           changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or our    failure to perform in line with such estimates or our published    guidance;           changes in market valuations of other semiconductor companies;           announcements by us or our competitors of significant new    products, technical innovations, acquisitions or dispositions,    litigation or capital commitments;           departures of key personnel;           actual or perceived noncompliance with corporate responsibility    or ethics standards by us or any of our employees, officers or    directors; and           negative media publicity targeting us or our competitors.     The stock market has historically experienced volatility,    especially within the semiconductor industry, that often has    been unrelated to the performance of particular companies. These    market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless    of our operating results"
6,ADI,ANALOG DEVICES,2006-11-20,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS"" --> ITEM 1A.  RISK    FACTORS     Set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other    documents we file with the SEC are descriptions of the risks and    uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ    materially from the results contemplated by the forward-looking    statements contained in this report. Our    future revenue and operating results are difficult to predict    and may materially fluctuate.     Our future revenue and operating results are difficult to    predict and may be materially affected by a number of factors,    including changes in customer demand for our products and for    end products that incorporate our products, the timing of new    product announcements or introductions by us, our customers or    our competitors, competitive pricing pressures, fluctuations in    manufacturing yields, adequate availability of wafers and other    raw materials, and manufacturing, assembly and test capacity,    the risk that our backlog could decline significantly, the    timing, delay or cancellation of significant customer orders and    our ability to manage inventory, our ability to hire, retain and    motivate adequate numbers of engineers and other qualified    employees to meet the demands of our customers, changes in    product or customer mix, potential significant    litigation-related costs, the effect of adverse changes in    economic conditions in the United States and international    markets and the effects of public health emergencies, natural    disasters, terrorist activities, international conflicts and    other events beyond our control. In addition, the semiconductor    market has historically been cyclical and subject to significant    economic downturns. Our business is subject to rapid    technological changes and there can be no assurance, depending    on the mix of future business, that products stocked in    inventory will not be rendered obsolete before we ship them. As    a result of these and other factors, there can be no assurance    that we will not experience material fluctuations in future    revenue and operating results on a quarterly or annual basis. In    addition, if our revenue and operating results do not meet the    expectations of securities analysts or investors, the market    price of our common stock may decline. Long-term    contracts are not typical for us and reductions, cancelations or    delays in orders for our products could adversely affect our    operating results.     In certain markets where end-user demand may be particularly    volatile and difficult to predict, some customers place orders    that require us to manufacture product and have it available for    shipment, even though the customer is unwilling to make a    binding commitment to purchase all, or even any, of the product.    At any given time, this situation could affect a portion of our    backlog. As a result, we may incur inventory and manufacturing    costs in advance of anticipated sales and are subject to the    risk of cancelation of orders leading to a sharp reduction of    sales and backlog. Further, those orders may be for products    that meet the customers unique requirements so that those    canceled orders would, in addition, result in an inventory of    unsaleable products, resulting in potential inventory    write-offs. As a result of lengthy manufacturing cycles for    certain of the products that are subject to these uncertainties,    the amount of unsaleable product could be substantial.    Reductions, cancelations or delays in orders for our products    could adversely affect our operating results. Our    future success depends upon our ability to continue to improve    our products, develop and market new products, and enter new    markets.     Our success significantly depends on our continued ability to    improve our products and develop and market new products.    Product development and enhancement is often a complex,    time-consuming and costly process, and there can be no assurance    that we will be able to develop and introduce new and improved    products in a timely or efficient manner or that new and    improved products, if developed, will achieve market acceptance.    Our products generally must conform to various evolving and    sometimes competing industry standards, which may adversely    affect our ability to compete in certain markets or require us    to incur significant costs. In addition, our customers generally    impose very high quality and reliability standards on our    products, which often change and may be difficult or costly to    satisfy. Any inability to satisfy such quality standards or    comply with industry standards and technical requirements, may    adversely affect demand for our products and our results of    operations. In addition, our growth is dependent on our    continued ability to penetrate new markets where we have limited    experience and competition is intense. There can be no assurance    that the markets we serve will grow in the future, that our    existing and new products will meet the requirements of these    markets, that our products will achieve customer acceptance in    these markets, that competitors will not force prices to an    unacceptably low level or take market share from us, or    10Table of Contents    that we can achieve or maintain profits in these markets.    Furthermore, a decline in demand in one or several of our    end-user markets could have a material adverse effect on the    demand for our products and our results of operations. Also,    some of our customers in these markets are less established,    which could subject us to increased credit risk. We may    not be able to compete successfully in markets within the    semiconductor industry in the future.     Many other companies offer products that compete with our    products. Some have greater financial, manufacturing, technical    and marketing resources than we have. Some of our competitors    may have better established supply or development relationships    with our current and potential customers. Additionally, some    formerly independent competitors have been purchased by larger    companies. Our competitors also include emerging companies    selling specialized products in markets we serve. Existing or    new competitors may develop products or technologies that more    effectively address the demands of our markets with enhanced    features and functionality, lower power requirements, greater    levels of integration or lower cost. Increased competition in    certain markets has resulted in and may continue to result in    declining average selling prices, reduced gross margins and loss    of market share in such markets. There can be no assurance that    we will be able to compete successfully in the future against    existing or new competitors, or that our operating results will    not be adversely affected by increased price competition. We rely    on third-party subcontractors and manufacturers for some    industry-standard wafers and assembly/test services, and    therefore cannot control their availability or conditions of    supply.     We rely, and plan to continue to rely, on assembly and test    subcontractors and on third-party wafer fabricators to supply    most of our wafers that can be manufactured using    industry-standard submicron processes. This reliance involves    several risks, including reduced control over availability,    capacity utilization, delivery schedules, manufacturing yields,    quality assurance and costs. Additionally, we utilize    third-party wafer fabricators as sole-source suppliers,    primarily Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. These    suppliers manufacture components in accordance with our    proprietary designs and specifications. We have no written    supply agreements with these sole-source suppliers and purchase    our custom components through individual purchase orders. In    addition, these suppliers often provide manufacturing services    to our competitors and therefore periods of increased industry    demand may result in capacity constraints. If these sole-source    suppliers are unable or unwilling to manufacture and deliver    sufficient quantities of components to us on the time schedule    and of the quality that we require, we may be forced to seek to    engage additional or replacement suppliers, which could result    in additional expenses and delays in product development or    shipment of product to our customers. We may    not be able to satisfy increasing demand for our products, and    increased production may lead to overcapacity and lower    prices.     The cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry has resulted    in sustained and short-term periods when demand for our products    has increased or decreased rapidly. During these periods of    rapid increases in demand, our available capacity may not be    sufficient to satisfy the available demand. In addition, we may    not be able to expand our workforce and operations in a    sufficiently timely manner, or locate suitable third-party    suppliers, to respond effectively to changes in demand for our    existing products or to the demand for new products requested by    our customers, and our current or future business could be    materially and adversely affected. Conversely, if we expand our    operations and workforce too rapidly in anticipation of    increased demand for our products, and such demand does not    materialize at the pace at which we expect, our operating    results may be adversely affected. These capacity expansions by    us and other semiconductor manufacturers could also lead to    overcapacity in our target markets which could lead to price    erosion that would adversely impact our operating results. Our    revenue may not increase enough to offset the expense of    additional capacity.     We, and the semiconductor industry generally, expand production    facilities and access to third-party foundries in response to    periods of increased demand which can cause operating expenses    to increase. Should customer demand fail to increase or should    the semiconductor industry enter a period of reduced customer    demand, our financial position and results of operations could    be adversely impacted as a result of increased operating    expenses, reduced margins, underutilization of capacity or asset    impairment charges.    11Table of ContentsWe may be    unable to adequately protect our proprietary rights, which may    limit our ability to compete effectively.     Our success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our    intellectual property. We primarily rely on patent, copyright,    trademark and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure    agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietary    technologies and processes. Despite our efforts to protect our    proprietary technologies and processes, it is possible that    competitors or other unauthorized third parties may obtain,    copy, use or disclose our technologies and processes. Moreover,    the laws of foreign countries in which we design, manufacture    and market our products may afford little or no effective    protection of our proprietary technology.     There can no assurance that the claims allowed in our issued    patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. In    addition, any of our existing or future patents may be    challenged, invalidated or circumvented. As such, any rights    granted under these patents may not provide us with meaningful    protection. We may not have foreign patents or pending    applications corresponding to our U.S. patents and    applications. Even if foreign patents are granted, effective    enforcement in foreign countries may not be available. If our    patents do not adequately protect our technology, our    competitors may be able to offer products similar to ours. Our    competitors may also be able to develop similar technology    independently or design around our patents. Other companies or    individuals have obtained patents covering a variety of    semiconductor designs and processes, and we might be required to    obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from    making and selling the infringing products, if such patents are    found to be valid. There can be no assurance that we would be    able to obtain licenses, if required, upon commercially    reasonable terms, or at all.     We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our    employees, consultants and strategic partners. We also try to    control access to and distribution of our technologies,    documentation and other proprietary information. Despite these    efforts, internal or external parties may attempt to copy,    disclose, obtain or use our products, services or technology    without our authorization. Also, former employees may seek    employment with our business partners, customers or competitors,    and there can be no assurance that the confidential nature of    our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of    such future employment. We are    involved in frequent litigation regarding intellectual property    rights, which could be costly to bring or defend and could    require us to redesign products or pay significant    royalties.     The semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims    and litigation involving patent and other intellectual property    rights, including claims arising under our contractual    indemnification of our customers. We have received from time to    time, and may receive in the future, claims from third parties    asserting that our products or processes infringe their patents    or other intellectual property rights. In the event a third    party makes a valid intellectual property claim against us and a    license is not available to us on commercially reasonable terms,    or at all, we could be forced either to redesign or to stop    production of products incorporating that intellectual property,    and our operating results could be materially and adversely    affected. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents or    other of our intellectual property rights or to defend us    against claims of infringement, and this litigation could be    costly and divert the attention of our key personnel. See    Note 13 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial    Statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on    Form 10-K    for information concerning certain pending litigation that    involves us. An adverse outcome in these matters or other    litigation could have a material adverse effect on our    consolidated financial position or on our consolidated results    of operations or cash flows in the period in which the    litigation is resolved. If we do    not retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our    business strategy will be limited.     Our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued    service of our executive officers and key management and    technical personnel, particularly our experienced engineers, and    on our ability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate    qualified personnel. The competition for these employees is    intense. The loss of the services of one or more of our key    personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating    results. In addition, there could be a material adverse effect    on us should the turnover rates for engineers and other key    personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue    to attract qualified personnel. We do not maintain any key    person life insurance policy on any of our officers or employees.    12Table of ContentsTo remain    competitive we may need to acquire other companies or purchase    or license technology from third parties in order to introduce    new products and services or enhance our existing products and    services.     An element of our business strategy involves expansion through    the acquisitions of businesses, assets, products or technologies    that allow us to complement our existing product offerings,    expand our market coverage, increase our engineering workforce    or enhance our technological capabilities. We may not be able to    find businesses that have the technology or resources we need    and, if we find such businesses, may not be able to purchase or    license the technology or resources on commercially favorable    terms or at all. Acquisitions and technology licenses are    difficult to identify and complete for a number of reasons,    including the cost of potential transactions, competition among    prospective buyers and licensees and the need for regulatory    approvals. In order to finance a potential transaction, we may    need to raise additional funds by selling our stock or borrowing    money. We may not be able to find financing on favorable terms,    and the sale of our stock may result in the dilution of our    existing shareholders or the issuance of securities with rights    that are superior to the rights of our common stockholders.    Acquisitions also involve a number of risks, including:           difficulty integrating acquired technologies, operations and    personnel with our existing businesses;           diversion of management attention in connection with both    negotiating the acquisitions and integrating the assets;           strain on managerial and operational resources as management    tries to oversee larger operations;           the future funding requirements for acquired companies, which    may be significant;           potential loss of key employees;           exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired    companies; and           increased risk of costly and time-consuming litigation.     If we are unable to successfully address these risks, we may not    realize some or all of the expected benefits of the acquisition,    which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of    operations. We rely    on manufacturing capacity located in geologically unstable    areas, which could affect the availability of supplies and    services.     We, and many companies in the semiconductor industry, rely on    internal manufacturing capacity, wafer fabrication foundries and    other sub-contractors in geologically unstable locations around    the world. This reliance involves risks associated with the    impact of earthquakes on us and the semiconductor industry,    including temporary loss of capacity, availability and cost of    key raw materials and equipment and availability of key services    including transport. Any prolonged inability to utilize one of    our manufacturing facilities, or those of our subcontractors or    third party wafer-fabrication foundries, as a result of fire,    natural disaster, unavailability of electric power or otherwise,    would have a material adverse effect on our results of    operations and financial condition. We are    exposed to business, economic, political and other risks through    our significant worldwide operations.     During fiscal 2006, approximately 75% of our revenue was derived    from customers in international markets. Although we engage in    hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to currency exchange    rate fluctuations, there can be no assurance that our    competitive position will not be adversely affected by changes    in the exchange rate of the United States dollar against other    currencies. Potential interest rate increases, particularly in    the United States and China, as well as high energy costs could    have an adverse impact on industrial and consumer spending    patterns and could adversely impact demand for our products. We    have manufacturing facilities outside the United States in    Ireland and the Philippines. In addition to being exposed to the    ongoing economic cycles in the semiconductor industry, we are    also subject to the economic and political risks inherent in    international operations and their impact on the United States    economy in general, including the risks associated with ongoing    uncertainties and political and economic instability in many    countries around the world as well as the economic disruption    from acts of terrorism, and the response to them by the United    States and its allies. Other business risks associated with    international operations include increased managerial    complexities, air transportation disruptions, expropriation,    currency    13Table of Contents    controls, currency exchange rate movement, additional costs    related to foreign taxes, tariffs and freight rate increases,    exposure to different business practices and legal standards,    particularly with respect to price protection and intellectual    property, trade and travel restrictions, pandemics, import and    export license requirements and restrictions, difficulties in    staffing and managing worldwide operations, and accounts    receivable collections. Our    future operating results are dependent on the performance of    independent distributors and sales representatives.     A significant portion of our sales are through independent    distributors that are not under our control. These independent    distributors generally represent product lines offered by    several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts    applied to our products or terminate their representation of us.    We generally do not require letters of credit from our    distributors and are not protected against accounts receivable    default or bankruptcy by these distributors. Our inability to    collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect our    results of operations. Termination of a significant distributor,    whether at our initiative or the distributors initiative,    could disrupt our current business. If we are unable to find    suitable replacements in the event of terminations by    significant distributors or sales representatives, our operating    results could be adversely affected. Our    manufacturing processes are highly complex and may be    interrupted.     We have manufacturing processes that utilize a substantial    amount of technology as the fabrication of integrated circuits    is a highly complex and precise process. Minute impurities,    contaminants in the manufacturing environment, difficulties in    the fabrication process, defects in the masks used in the wafer    manufacturing process, manufacturing equipment failures, wafer    breakage or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of    wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be    nonfunctional. While we have significant expertise in    semiconductor manufacturing, it is possible that some processes    could become unstable. This instability could result in    manufacturing delays and product shortages, which could have a    material adverse effect on our financial position or results of    operations. Our stock    price may be volatile.     The market price of our common stock has been volatile in the    past and may be volatile in the future, as it may be    significantly affected by the following factors:           actual or anticipated fluctuations in our revenue and operating    results;           changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or our    failure to perform in line with such estimates;           changes in market valuations of other semiconductor companies;           announcements by us or our competitors of significant new    products, technical innovations, acquisitions or dispositions,    litigation or capital commitments; and           departures of key personnel.     The stock market has historically experienced volatility,    especially within the semiconductor industry, that often has    been unrelated to the performance of particular companies. These    market fluctuations may cause our stock price to fall regardless    of our operating results"
