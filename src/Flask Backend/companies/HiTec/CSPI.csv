     This document contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Further, anyforward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made. As it isnot possible to predict every new factor that may emerge, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual future financial condition or results. In response to competitive pressures or new product introductions, we maytake certain pricing or marketing actions that could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, changes in the products and services mix may cause fluctuations in our gross margin. Due to the potential quarterly fluctuations in operatingresults, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily an indicator of future performance.    Markets for our products and services are characterized by rapidly changing technology, new product introductions and short product life cycles. Thesechanges can adversely affect our business and operating results. Our success will depend upon our ability to enhance our existing products and services and to develop and introduce, on a timely and cost effective basis, new products that keep pacewith technological developments and address increasing customer requirements. The inability to meet these demands could adversely affect our business and operating results.    We Depend on a Small Number of Customers for a Significant Portion of our Revenue and Loss of any Customer CouldSignificantly Affect the Business    We are dependent on asmall number of customers for a large portion of our revenues. In our Systems segment, for the year ended September 30, 2007, sales to Raytheon accounted for 19% of consolidated revenues. In the Service and System Integration segment, sales toAtos Origin accounted for approximately 15% and 14% of total consolidated revenues for the years ended September 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively and sales to Kabel Deutschland accounted for approximately 9% and 12% of consolidated revenues forthe years ended September 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. A significant diminution in the sales to or loss of any of our major customers would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Inaddition, our revenues are largely dependent upon the ability of our customers to have continued growth or need for services or to develop and sell products that incorporate our products. No assurance can be given that our customers will notexperience financial or other difficulties that could adversely affect their operations and, in turn, our results of operations.    We Depend on Defense Business for a Significant Amount of our Revenue and the Loss or Decline of Existing or Future Defense Business Could AdverselyAffect our Financial Results    Sales of our systems to thedefense market accounted for approximately 23%, 13%, and 16% of our consolidated revenues and 99%, 98% and 97% of the Systems segment sales for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Reductions in governmentspending on programs that incorporate our products could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, our subcontracts are subject to special risks, such as:      delays in funding;      ability of the government agency to unilaterally terminate the prime contract;      reduction or modification in the event of changes in government policies or as the result of budgetary constraints or political changes;     increased or unexpected costs under fixed price contracts; and      other factors that are not under our control.    In addition, consolidation among defense industry contractors has resulted in fewer contractors with increased bargaining power relative to our bargainingpower. No assurance can be given that such increased bargaining power will not adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in the future.   8 Table of ContentsChanges in government administration, as well as changes in the geo-political environment such as thecurrent War on Terrorism, can have significant impact on defense spending priorities and the efficient handling of routine contractual matters. Such changes could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, or results ofoperations in the future.    We Face Competition That CouldAdversely Affect our Sales and Profitability    The marketsfor our products are highly competitive and are characterized by rapidly changing technology, frequent product performance improvements and evolving industry standards. Due to the rapidly changing nature of technology, new competitors may emerge ofwhich we have no current awareness. Competitors may be able to offer more attractive pricing or develop products that could offer performance features that are superior to our products, resulting in reduced demand for our products. Such competitorscould have a negative impact on our ability to win future business opportunities. There can be no assurance that a new competitor will not attempt to penetrate the various markets for our products and services. Their entry into markets historicallytargeted by us may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.    Slowdown in the Economy Can Affect our Revenue and Profitability    The uncertainty regarding the growth rate of the worldwide economies has caused companies to reduce capital investment and this may causefurther reduction of demand for our products and services. These reductions have been particularly severe in the electronics and technology industries.    Our Operating Results May Fluctuate Significantly    Our operating results have fluctuated widely on a quarterly and annual basis during the last several years, and we expect to experience significantfluctuations in future operating results. Many factors, some of which are beyond our control, have contributed to these fluctuations in the past and may continue to do so. Such factors include:      sales in relatively large dollar amounts to a relatively small number of customers;      competitive pricing programs and volume discounts;      loss of customers;      market acceptance of our products;      product obsolescence;      general economic conditions;      change in the mix of products sold;      obtaining or failure to obtain design wins for significant customer systems;      timing of significant orders;      delays in completion of internal product development projects;      delays in shipping our products;      delays in acceptance testing by customers;      production delays due to quality programs with outsourced components;      shortages of components;      timing of product line transitions;      declines of revenues from previous generations of products following announcement of replacement products containing more advance technology; and     fixed nature of our expenditures on personnel, facilities and marketing programs.   9 Table of ContentsWe believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations will not necessarily bemeaningful and should not be relied upon as indicative of our future performance. It is also possible that in some periods, our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In such circumstances, the price ofour common stock may decline.    We Rely on Single Sources forSupply of Certain Components and our Business may be Seriously Harmed if our Supply of any of These Components or Other Components is Disrupted    Several components used in our Systems products are currently obtained from sole-source suppliers. We are dependent on key vendors like Myricom, Inc. aswell as Freescale Semiconductor, Inc. (Freescale) for many of our PowerPC line of processors. Generally, suppliers may terminate their purchase order with us without cause upon 30-days notice and may cease offering products to us upon180-days notice. If Freescale were to limit or reduce the sale of such components to us, or if these or other component suppliers to us, some of which are small companies, were to experience financial difficulties or other problems which preventedthem from supplying us with the necessary components, such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These sole source and other suppliers are each subject to quality and performanceissues, materials shortages, excess demand, reduction in capacity and other factors that may disrupt the flow of goods to us or our customers, which thereby may adversely affect our business and customer relationships.    We have no guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers and there can beno assurance that our suppliers will continue to meet our requirements. If our supply arrangements are interrupted, there can be no assurance that we would be able to find another supplier on a timely or satisfactory basis. Any shortage orinterruption in the supply of any of the components used in our products, or the inability to procure these components from alternate sources on acceptable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and resultsof operations. There can be no assurance that severe shortages of components will not occur in the future. Such shortages could increase the cost or delay the shipment of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,financial condition and results of operations. Significant increases in the prices of these components would also materially adversely affect our financial performance since we may not be able to adjust product pricing to reflect the increase incomponent costs. We could incur set-up costs and delays in manufacturing should it become necessary to replace any key vendors due to work stoppages, shipping delays, financial difficulties or other factors and, under certain circumstances, thesecosts and delays could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.    We Depend on Key Personnel and Skilled Employees and Face Competition in Hiring and Retaining Qualified Employees    We are largely dependent upon the skills and efforts of our seniormanagement, managerial, sales and technical employees. None of our senior management or other key employees are subject to any employment contracts which require services for a period of time. The loss of services of any of our executives or otherkey personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our future success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to attract, train, motivate and retain highly skilled technicalprofessionals. Our ability to maintain and renew existing engagements and obtain new business depends, in large part, on our ability to hire and retain technical personnel with the skills that keep pace with continuing changes in industry standardsand technologies. The inability to hire additional qualified personnel could impair our ability to satisfy our growing client base, requiring an increase in the level of responsibility for both existing and new personnel. There can be no assurancethat we will be successful in retaining current or future employees.    Our International Operations are Subject to a Number of Risks    We market and sell our products in certain international markets, and we have established operations in the UK and Germany. Foreign-based revenue is determined based on the location to which the product is shipped or  10 Table of Contentsservices are rendered, and represented 45%, 46%, and 50% of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2007, 2006, and 2005,respectively. If revenues generated by foreign activities are not adequate to offset the expense of establishing and maintaining these foreign subsidiaries and activities, our business, financial condition and results of operations could bematerially adversely affected. In addition, there are certain risks inherent in transacting business internationally, such as changes in applicable laws and regulatory requirements, export and import restrictions, export controls relating totechnology, tariffs and other trade barriers, less favorable operations, longer payment cycles, problems in collecting accounts receivable, political instability, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, expatriation controls and potential adversetax consequences, any of which could adversely impact the success of our international activities. A portion of our revenues are from sales to foreign entities, including foreign governments, which are primarily paid in the form of foreigncurrencies. There can be no assurance that one or more of such factors will not have a material adverse effect on our future international activities and, consequently, on our business, financial condition or results of operations.    We may identify material weaknesses in internal control over financialreporting which could affect our ability to timely meet our regulatory reporting requirements.    For the year ended September 30, 2006, we were unable to timely file our Annual Report on Form 10-K due to material weaknesses in internal control asdiscussed in Item 9A. As a result, management had concluded in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2006 that internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of the end of the period covered by thereport. Since then, we have taken actions that have remediated these material weaknesses, by hiring additional senior accounting personnel and outsourcing certain functions to external consultants with appropriate expertise. However, there can be noassurance that we will not have material weaknesses in future periods that could impede our ability to timely meet our future regulatory reporting requirements and conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective for futureperiods. Our inability to timely meet our regulatory reporting requirements could affect our ability to maintain our listing status on the NASDAQ Global Market.   To be Successful, We Must Respond to the Rapid Changes in Technology    Our future success will depend in part on our ability to enhance our current products and to develop new products on atimely and cost-effective basis in order to respond to technological developments and changing customer needs. The defense market, in particular, demands constant technological improvements as a means of gaining military advantage. Military plannershistorically have funded significantly more design projects than actual deployments of new equipment, and those systems that are deployed tend to contain the components of the subcontractors selected to participate in the design process. In order toparticipate in the design of new defense electronics systems, we must be able to demonstrate our ability to deliver superior technological performance on a timely and cost-effective basis. There can be no assurance that we will be able to secure anadequate number of defense electronics design wins in the future, that the equipment in which our products are intended to function eventually will be deployed in the field, or that our products will be included in such equipment if it is eventuallydeployed.    The design-in process is typically lengthy andexpensive, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to meet the product specifications of our customers in a timely and adequate manner. In addition, if we fail to anticipate or to respond adequately to changes in technologyand customer preferences, or if there is any significant delay in product developments or introductions, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including the risk of inventoryobsolescence. Because of the complexity of our products, we have experienced delays from time to time in completing products on a timely basis. If we are unable to design, develop or introduce competitive new products on a timely basis, our futureoperating results would be adversely affected. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing new products or enhancing our existing products on a timely or cost-effective basis, or that such new products or product enhancementswill achieve market acceptance.   11 Table of ContentsWe Need to Continue to Expend Resources on Research and Development Efforts to Meet the Needs of ourCustomers    The industry in which our Systems segmentcompetes is characterized by the need for continued investment in research and development. If we fail to invest sufficiently in research and development, our products could become less attractive to potential customers, and our business andfinancial condition could be materially adversely affected. As a result of our need to maintain or increase our spending levels in this area and the difficulty in reducing costs associated with research and development, our operating results couldbe materially harmed if our revenues fall below expectations. In addition, as a result of CSPIs commitment to invest in research and development, spending as a percent of revenues may fluctuate in the future.    We May be Unable to Successfully Integrate Acquisitions    In order to achieve strategic objectives to maintain and grow our marketposition, we may have a need to acquire or make investments in complementary companies, products or technologies. Acquisitions may pose risks to our operations, including:      problems and increased costs in connection with the integration of the personnel, operations, technologies or products of the acquired companies;     unanticipated costs;      diversion of managements attention from our core business;      adverse effects on business relationships with suppliers and customers and those of the acquired company;      acquired assets becoming impaired as a result of technical advancements or worse-than-expected performance by the acquired company;      entering markets in which we have no, or limited, prior experience; and      potential loss of key employees, particularly those of the acquired organization.    In addition, in connection with any acquisitions or investments we could:      issue stock that would dilute existing shareholders percentage of ownership;      incur debt and assume liabilities;      obtain financing on unfavorable terms;      incur amortization expenses related to acquired intangible assets or incur large and immediate write-offs;      incur large expenditures related to office closures of the acquired companies, including costs relating to termination of employees and leasehold improvementcharges relating to vacating the acquired companies premises; and      reduce the cash that would otherwise be available to fund operations or to use for other purposes.    The failure to successfully integrate any acquisition or for acquisitions toyield expected results may negatively impact our financial condition and operating results. Any resulting impairment of goodwill would have a negative effect on results of operations.    Our Stock Price May Continue to be Volatile    Historically, the market for technology stocks has been extremely volatile. Our common stock has experienced, and maycontinue to experience, substantial price volatility. The following factors could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly:      loss of a major customer;   12 Table of Contents   the addition or departure of key personnel;      variations in our quarterly operating results;      announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, new products or product enhancements;      acquisitions, distribution partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;      regulatory changes;      sales of our common stock or other securities in the future;      changes in market valuations of technology companies; and      fluctuations in stock market prices and volumes.    In addition, the stock market in general, and the NASDAQ Global Market and technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volumefluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies. These broad market and industry factors may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actualoperating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies.   "

Sales to Kabel Deutschland accounted for 12% of consolidated revenues in 2006. Lockheed-Martin, a large defense contractor, accounted for 8% of our sales in 2006 and 5% and 11% of our sales infiscal years 2005 and 2004, respectively.

Our common stock has experienced, and maycontinue to experience, substantial price volatility. The following factors could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly:      our loss of a major customer;   12 Table of Contents   the addition or departure of key personnel;      variations in our quarterly operating results;      announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, new products or product enhancements;      acquisitions, distribution partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;      regulatory changes;      sales of our common stock or other securities in the future;      changes in market valuations of technology companies; and      fluctuations in stock market prices and volumes.    In addition, the stock market in general, and the NASDAQ Stock Market and technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volumefluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies.

In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies.    Our material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting maycontinue to affect our ability to timely meet our regulatory reporting requirements.    We were unable to timely file our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended September 30, 2006 due to the continued material weaknesses in internal control as discussed in Item 9A herein. As a result, Managementconcluded in its Annual Report that internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of the end of the period covered by the report. We have taken, and plan to take, additional steps to remediate these material weaknesses, by hiringadditional senior accounting personnel and outsourcing certain functions to external consultants with appropriate expertise, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to completely remediate our material weaknesses such that we will be ableto timely meet our future regulatory reporting requirements and conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. Our inability to timely meet our regulatory reporting requirements will continue to affect our ability tomaintain our listing status on the Nasdaq Stock Market.   "

    This document contains forward-looking statements based on current expectations that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Further, anyforward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such statement is made, and we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which such statement is made. As it isnot possible to predict every new factor that may emerge, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as a prediction of actual future financial condition or results. In response to competitive pressures or new product introductions, we maytake certain pricing or marketing actions that could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, changes in the products and services mix may cause fluctuations in our gross margin. Due to the potential quarterly fluctuations in operatingresults, we believe that quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily an indicator of future performance.    Markets for our products and services are characterized by rapidly changing technology, new product introductions and short product life cycles. Thesechanges can adversely affect our business and operating results. Our success will depend upon our ability to enhance our existing products and services and to develop and introduce, on a timely and cost effect basis, new products that keep pace withtechnological developments   8 Table of Contentsand address increasing customer requirements. The inability to meet these demands could adversely affect our business and operating results.    We Depend on a Small Number of Customers for a Significant Portion of ourRevenue and Loss of any Customer Could Significantly Affect the Business    We are dependent on a small number of customers for a large portion of our revenues. Sales to E-Plus, a wireless telecommunications company in Germany, and those to E-Plus through its system integrator, Atos,accounted for 15%, 22% and 33% of sales in fiscal years ended September 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Lockheed-Martin, a large defense contractor, accounted for 5% of our sales in 2005 and 11% and 3% of our sales in fiscal years 2004and 2003, respectively. A significant diminution in the sales to or loss of any of our major customers would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, our revenues are largelydependent upon the ability of our customers to have continued growth or need for services or to develop and sell products that incorporate our products. No assurance can be given that our customers will not experience financial or other difficultiesthat could adversely affect their operations and, in turn, our results of operations.    We Depend on Defense Business for a Significant Amount of our Revenue and the Loss or Decline of Existing or Future Defense Business Could Adversely Affect our Financial Results    Sales of our systems to the defense market accounted for approximately 16%,18% and 18% of our consolidated revenues and 97%, 97% and 95% of the Systems segment sales for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Reductions in government spending on programs that incorporate our productscould have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, our subcontracts are subject to special risks, such as:     delays in funding;     ability of the government agency to unilaterally terminate the prime contract;     reduction or modification in the event of changes in government policies or as the result of budgetary constraints or political changes;     increased or unexpected costs under fixed price contracts; and     other factors that are not under our control.    In addition, consolidation among defense industry contractors has resulted in fewer contractors with increased bargaining power relative to our bargainingpower. No assurance can be given that such increased bargaining power will not adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations in the future.    Changes in government administration, as well as changes in the geo-political environment such as the current War onTerrorism, can have significant impact on defense spending priorities and the efficient handling of routine contractual matters. Such changes could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, or results of operations in thefuture.    We Face Competition That Could Adversely Affect ourSales and Profitability    The markets for our products arehighly competitive and are characterized by rapidly changing technology, frequent product performance improvements and evolving industry standards. Due to the rapidly changing nature of technology, new competitors may emerge of which we have nocurrent awareness. Competitors may be able to offer more attractive pricing or develop products that could offer performance features that are superior to our products, resulting in reduced demand for our products. Such competitors could have anegative impact on our ability to win future business opportunities. There can be no assurance that a new competitor will not attempt to   9 Table of Contentspenetrate the various markets for our products and services. Their entry into markets historically targeted by us may have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.    Slowdown in the Economy Can Affect our Revenue and Profitability    The uncertainty regarding the growth rate of the worldwide economies has caused companies to reduce capital investment and this may cause further reduction of demand for our products and services. These reductionshave been particularly severe in the electronics and technology industries. Growth in our European markets may be adversely affected by continued weakness in the German economy in 2006.    Our Operating Results May Fluctuate Significantly    Our operating results have fluctuated widely on a quarterly and annual basis during the last several years, and we expect toexperience significant fluctuations in future operating results. Many factors, some of which are beyond our control, have contributed to these fluctuations in the past and may continue to do so. Such factors include:     sales in relatively large dollar amounts to a relatively small number of customers;     competitive pricing programs;     loss of customers;     market acceptance of our products;     product obsolescence;     general economic conditions;     change in the mix of products sold;     obtaining or failure to obtain design wins for significant customer systems;     timing of significant orders;     delays in completion of internal product development projects;     delays in shipping our products;     delays in acceptance testing by customers;     production delays due to quality programs with outsourced components;     shortages of components;     timing of product line transitions;     declines of revenues from previous generations of products following announcement of replacement products containing more advance technology; and     fixed nature of our expenditures on personnel, facilities and marketing programs.    We believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations will not necessarily be meaningful and should notbe relied upon as indicative of our future performance. It is also possible that in some periods, our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In such circumstances, the price of our common stock maydecline.   10 Table of ContentsWe Rely on Single Sources for Supply of Certain Components and our Business may be Seriously Harmed ifour Supply of any of These Components or Other Components is Disrupted    Several components used in our Systems products are currently obtained from sole-source suppliers. We are dependent on key vendors like Myricom as well as Freescale for many of our PowerPC line of processors.Generally, suppliers may terminate their purchase order with us without cause upon 30-days notice and may cease offering products to us upon 180-days notice. If Motorola was to limit or reduce the sale of such components to us, or if these or othercomponent suppliers to us, some of which are small companies, were to experience financial difficulties or other problems which prevented them from supplying us with the necessary components, such events could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. These sole source and other suppliers are each subject to quality and performance issues, materials shortages, excess demand, reduction in capacity and other factors that may disrupt the flowof goods to us or our customers; thereby may adversely affect our business and customer relationships. We have no guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers and there can be no assurance that our suppliers will continue to meet ourrequirements. If our supply arrangements are interrupted, there can be no assurance that we would be able to find another supplier on a timely or satisfactory basis. Any shortage or interruption in the supply of any of the components used in ourproducts, or the inability to procure these components from alternate sources on acceptable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that severe shortages ofcomponents will not occur in the future. Such shortages could increase the cost or delay the shipment of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Significant increasesin the prices of these components would also materially adversely affect our financial performance since we may not be able to adjust product pricing to reflect the increase in component costs. We could incur set-up costs and delays in manufacturingshould it become necessary to replace any key vendors due to work stoppages, shipping delays, financial difficulties or other factors and, under certain circumstances, these costs and delays could have a material adverse effect on our business,financial condition and results of operations.    We Depend onKey Personnel and Skilled Employees and Face Competition in Hiring and Retaining Qualified Employees    We are largely dependent upon the skills and efforts of our senior management, managerial, sales and technical employees. None of our senior management orother key employees are subject to any employment contract which require services for a period of time. The loss of services of any of our executives or other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditionand results of operations. Our future success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to attract, train, motivate and retain highly skilled technical professionals. Our ability to maintain and renew existing engagements and obtain newbusiness depends, in large part, on our ability to hire and retain technical personnel with the skills that keep pace with continuing changes in industry standards and technologies. The inability to hire additional qualified personnel could impairour ability to satisfy our growing client base, requiring an increase in the level of responsibility for both existing and new personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining current or future employees.    Our International Operations are Subject to a Number of Risks   We market and sell our products in certain internationalmarkets, and we have established subsidiaries in the United Kingdom and Germany. Foreign-based revenue is determined based on the location to which the product is shipped or services are rendered, and represented 50%, 46% and 62% of our totalrevenue for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. If revenues generated by foreign activities are not adequate to offset the expense of establishing and maintaining these foreign subsidiaries and activities ourbusiness, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, there are certain risks inherent in transacting business internationally, such as changes in applicable laws and regulatory requirements,export and import restrictions, export controls relating to technology, tariffs and other trade barriers, less favorable operations, longer payment cycles, problems in collecting accounts receivable,   11 Table of Contentspolitical instability, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, expatriation controls and potential adverse tax consequences, any of which could adverselyimpact the success of our international activities. In the recent past, the financial markets in Asia have experienced significant turmoil. A portion of our revenues are from sales to foreign entities, including foreign governments, which areprimarily in the form of foreign currencies. There can be no assurance that one or more of such factors will not have a material adverse effect on our future international activities and, consequently, on our business, financial condition or resultsof operations.    To be Successful, We Must Respond to theRapid Changes in Technology    Our future success willdepend in part on our ability to enhance our current products and to develop new products on a timely and cost-effective basis in order to respond to technological developments and changing customer needs. The defense market, in particular, demandsconstant technological improvements as a means of gaining military advantage. Military planners historically have funded significantly more design projects than actual deployments of new equipment, and those systems that are deployed tend to containthe components of the subcontractors selected to participate in the design process. In order to participate in the design of new defense electronics systems, we must be able to demonstrate our ability to deliver superior technological performance ona timely and cost-effective basis. There can be no assurance that we will be able to secure an adequate number of defense electronics design wins in the future, that the equipment in which our products are intended to function eventually will bedeployed in the field, or that our products will be included in such equipment if it is eventually deployed.    The design-in process is typically lengthy and expensive, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to meet the productspecifications of our OEM customers in a timely and adequate manner. In addition, if we fail to anticipate or to respond adequately to changes in technology and customer preferences, or any significant delay in product developments or introductions,this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including the risk of inventory obsolescence. Because of the complexity of our products, we have experienced delays from time to time incompleting products on a timely basis. If we are unable to design, develop or introduce competitive new products on a timely basis, our future operating results would be adversely affected. There can be no assurance that we will be successful indeveloping new products or enhancing our existing products on a timely or cost-effective basis, or that such new products or product enhancements will achieve market acceptance.    We Need to Maintain our Research and Development Effort to Meet the Needs of our Customers    The industry in which our Systems segment competes is characterized by theneed for continued investment in research and development. If we fail to invest sufficiently in research and development, our products could become less attractive to potential customers, and our business and financial condition could be materiallyadversely affected. As a result of our need to maintain or increase our spending levels in this area and the difficulty in reducing costs associated with research and development, our operating results could be materially harmed if our revenues fallbelow expectations. In addition, as a result of CSPIs commitment to invest in research and development, spending as a percent of revenues may fluctuate in the future.    We May be Unable to Successfully Integrate Acquisitions    We may in the future acquire or make investments in complementary companies,products or technologies. Acquisitions may pose risks to our operations, including:     problems and increased costs in connection with the integration of the personnel, operations, technologies or products of the acquired companies;     unanticipated costs;     diversion of managements attention from our core business;     adverse effects on business relationships with suppliers and customers and those of the acquired company;   12 Table of Contents  acquired assets becoming impaired as a result of technical advancements or worse-than-expected performance by the acquired company;     entering markets in which we have no, or limited, prior experience; and     potential loss of key employees, particularly those of the acquired organization.    In addition, in connection with any acquisitions or investments we could:     issue stock that would dilute existing shareholders percentage of ownership;     incur debt and assume liabilities;     obtain financing on unfavorable terms;     incur amortization expenses related to acquired intangible assets or incur large and immediate write-offs;     incur large expenditures related to office closures of the acquired companies, including costs relating to termination of employees and leasehold improvement charges relating tovacating the acquired companies premises; and     reduce the cash that would otherwise be available to fund operations or to use for other purposes.    The failure to successfully integrate any acquisition or for acquisitions to yield expected results may negatively impactour financial condition and operating results.    Our StockPrice May Continue to be Volatile    Historically, themarket for technology stocks has been extremely volatile. Our common stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, substantial price volatility. The following factors could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuatesignificantly:     our loss of a major customer;     the addition or departure of key personnel;     variations in our quarterly operating results;     announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, new products or product enhancements;     acquisitions, distribution partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;     regulatory changes;     sales of our common stock or other securities in the future;     changes in market valuations of technology companies; and     fluctuations in stock market prices and volumes.    In addition, the stock market in general, and the NASDAQ National Market and technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volumefluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of such companies. These broad market and industry factors may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actualoperating performance. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a companys securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies.   "
