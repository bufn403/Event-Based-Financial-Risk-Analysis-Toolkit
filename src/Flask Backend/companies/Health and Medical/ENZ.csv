 Our failure to establish and maintain effective internal controlsover financial reporting and information technology access could result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements,our failure to meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which in turncould cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rulespromulgated by the SEC, companies are required to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of their internal control over financial reporting.As part of this process, we are required to document and test our internal control over financial reporting; management is required toassess and issue a report concerning our internal control over financial reporting; and our independent registered public accounting firmmay be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reportingmay not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumventionor overriding of controls, or fraud. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditionsor deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective controlsystem, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be prevented or detected timely. Even effective internal controls over financialreporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. The existence of a material weakness could result in errors in ourfinancial statements that could result in a restatement of financial statements, which could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations,lead to a loss of investor confidence and have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock. In connection with our April 30, 2023 unaudited consolidated financialstatements, Enzo’s management identified a deficiency, which it considers to be a “material weakness,” which could reasonablyresult in a material misstatement in the Company’s financial statements. The Company has implemented remediation measures. However,the material weakness cannot be considered remediated until the applicable controls have operated for a sufficient period of time andmanagement has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. Enzo has concluded that there are material weaknesses in its internalcontrol over financial reporting, which, if not remediated, could materially adversely affect its ability to timely and accurately reportits results of operations and financial condition. The accuracy of Enzo’s financial reporting depends on the effectiveness of itsinternal controls over financial reporting. Internal controls over financial reporting can provide only reasonableassurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Failureto maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, or lapses in disclosure controls and procedures, could undermine theability to provide accurate disclosure (including with respect to financial information) on a timely basis, which could cause investorsto lose confidence in Enzo’s disclosures (including with respect to financial information), require significant resources to remediatethe lapse or deficiency, and expose it to legal or regulatory proceedings. In connection with our April 30, 2023 unaudited consolidatedfinancial statements, Enzo’s management identified a deficiency, which it considers to be a “material weakness,” whichcould reasonably result in a material misstatement in the Company’s financial statements. The Company has implemented remediationmeasures. However, the material weakness cannot be considered remediated until the applicable controls have operated for a sufficientperiod of time and management has concluded, through testing, that these controls are operating effectively. Business Risks Our operating results may vary from period to period. Our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarterand from year to year, depending on a variety of factors including: ●customerdemand for our products due to changes in purchasing requirements and research needs; ●theintroduction of new products by us or our competitors; ●thetiming of our research and development, sales and marketing expenses; ●generalworldwide economic conditions affecting funding of research; ●expensesassociated with defending our intellectual property portfolio ●foreigncurrency exchange rate fluctuations; ●changesin tax laws, the results of tax audits or the measurement of tax uncertainties; and ●thesuccess of identifying, acquiring and integrating businesses that complement our product offerings, add new technology or add presencein a market; Consequently, results for any interim or full year period may not necessarilybe indicative of results in subsequent periods.  13  A significant proportion of our Products revenues are from academiccenters, funded by government grants in our major markets globally. Governments around the world have been reviewing long term public fundingof life science research in response to the problems arising from global financial pressures. As a result, the available funds for discretionarypurchases from market to market have been capped or reduced based on available National budgets. Reduced grants for researchers couldimpact our business, in the amount, price and type of products bought and used by customers. A significant proportion of our Products revenues are from customersin pharmaceutical and biotech companies. Globally, pharmaceutical companies are challenging internal budgets,and the return of investment from their R&D spend. This could impact our business, in the amount, price and type of products boughtand used by customers. Our future success will depend in part upon our ability to enhanceexisting products, develop and introduce new products and realize commercial acceptance of those products, in a rapidly changing technologicalenvironment. The market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology,evolving industry standards and new product introductions, which may make our existing products obsolete. Our future success will dependin part upon our ability to enhance existing products, develop and introduce new products, and realize commercial acceptance of thoseproducts. The development of new or enhanced products is a complex and uncertainprocess requiring the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends as well as precise technological execution. In addition,the successful development of new products will depend on the development of new technologies. We will be required to undertake time-consumingand costly development activities and to seek regulatory approval for these new products. We may experience difficulties that could delayor prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of these new products. Regulatory clearance or approval of any new productsmay not be granted by the FDA, state-wide agency or foreign regulatory authorities on a timely basis, or at all, and the new productsmay not be successfully commercialized. Our inability to carry out certain of our marketing and sales plansmay make it difficult for us to grow or maintain our business. The Products segment continues a marketing program designed to moredirectly service its end users, while simultaneously promoting the Enzo Life Science brand, with reference to our acquired brands. Wewill continue to reach out to our customers using our direct field sales force, in-house business team, the on-going enhancement of ourinteractive websites, continued attendance at top industry trade meetings, and publications to customers and in leading scientific journals.In addition to our direct sales, we operate worldwide through wholly-owned subsidiaries (in USA, Switzerland, Belgium, Germany, and theUK), a branch office in France and a network of third-party distributors in most other significant markets. If we are unable to successfullycontinue these programs, we may be unable to grow and our business could suffer. We face significant competition, which could cause us to decreasethe prices for our products or render our products uneconomical or obsolete, any of which could reduce our revenues and limit our growth. Our competitors in the biotechnology industry in the United Statesand abroad are numerous and include major pharmaceutical, energy, food and chemical companies, as well as specialized genetic engineeringfirms. Many of our large competitors have substantially greater resources than us and have the capability of developing products whichcompete directly with our products. Many of these companies are performing research in the same areas as we are. The markets for our productsare also subject to competitive risks because markets are highly price competitive. Our competitors have competed in the past by loweringprices on certain products.  These competitive conditions could, among other things: ●requireus to reduce our prices to retain market share; ●requireus to increase our marketing efforts which could reduce our profit margins; ●increaseour cost of labor to attract qualified personnel; ●renderour biotechnology products uneconomical or obsolete or; ●reduceour revenue Ethical, legal and social concerns surrounding the use of geneticinformation could reduce demand for our products. Genetic testing has raised ethical issues regarding privacy and theappropriate uses of the resulting information. For these reasons, governmental authorities may call for limits on or regulation of theuse of genetic testing or prohibit testing for genetic predisposition to certain conditions, particularly for those that have no knowncure. Similarly, such concerns may lead individuals to refuse to use genetics tests even if permissible. Any of these scenarios couldreduce the potential markets for our molecular diagnostic products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financialcondition and results of operations. 14  We depend on distributors and contract manufacturers and suppliersfor materials that could impair our ability to manufacture or distribute our products. We manufacture and distribute our own brand products and the productsof third party manufacturers and suppliers. Distributors also sell our branded products. To the extent we are unable to maintain or replacea distributor in a reasonable time period, or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, our operations could be disrupted. Outside distributors, suppliers and contract manufacturers providekey finished goods, components and raw materials used in the sale and manufacture of our products. Although we believe that alternativesources for components and raw materials are available, any supply interruption in a limited or sole source component or raw materialwould harm our ability to manufacture our products until a new source of supply is identified and qualified. In addition, an uncorrecteddefect or supplier’s variation in a component or raw material, either unknown to us or incompatible with our manufacturing process,could harm our ability to manufacture products. We might not be able to find a sufficient alternative supplier in a reasonable time period,or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we fail to obtain a supplier for the components of our products, our operations couldbe disrupted. We use hazardous materials in our business. Any claims relatingto improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials could be costly and time-consuming. Our manufacturing and research and development processes involve thestorage, use and disposal of hazardous substances, including hazardous chemicals, biological hazardous materials and radioactive compounds.We are subject to governmental regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of materials and waste products.Although we believe that our safety and environmental management practices and procedures for handling and disposing of these hazardousmaterials are in accordance with good industry practice and comply with applicable laws, permits, licenses and regulations, the risk ofaccidental environmental or human contamination or injury from the release or exposure of hazardous materials cannot be completely eliminated.In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result, including environmental clean-up or decontaminationcosts, and any such liability could exceed the limits of, or fall outside the coverage of, our insurance. We may not be able to maintain insurance on acceptable terms, or atall. We could be required to incur significant costs to comply with current or future environmental and public and workplace safety andhealth laws and regulations.  We are required to expend significant resources for research anddevelopment for our diagnostic products in development and these products may not be developed successfully. Failure to successfully developthese products may prevent us from earning a return on our research and development expenditures. The diagnostic products we are developing are at various stages ofdevelopment and clinical evaluations and may require further technical development and investment to determine whether commercial applicationis practicable. There can be no assurance that our efforts will result in products with valuable commercial applications. Our cash requirementsmay vary materially from current estimates because of results of our research and development programs, competitive and technologicaladvances and other factors. In any event, we will require substantial funds to conduct development activities, apply for regulatory approvalsand commercialize products, if any, that are developed. We do not have any commitments or arrangements to obtain any additionalfinancing and there is no assurance that required financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. Even if we spend substantialamounts on research and development, our potential diagnostic products may not be developed successfully. If our diagnostic product candidates on which we have expended significantamounts for research and development are not commercialized, we will not earn a return on our research and development expenditures, whichmay harm our business.  Risks relating to our Intellectual Property and Regulatory Approval Protecting our proprietary rights is difficult and costly. If wefail to adequately protect or enforce our proprietary rights, we could lose potential revenue from licensing and royalties. Our potential revenue and success depends in large part on our abilityto obtain, maintain and enforce our patents. Our ability to commercialize any product successfully will largely depend on our abilityto obtain and maintain patents of sufficient scope to prevent third parties from developing similar or competitive products. In the absenceof patent protection, competitors may impact our business by developing and marketing substantially equivalent products and technology. Patent disputes are frequent and can preclude the commercializationof products. We have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be, involved in material patent litigation, such as the mattersdiscussed under “Part I - Item 3. Legal Proceedings” in this report. Patent protection litigation is time-consuming and wehave incurred and anticipate continuing to incur significant legal costs. In addition, an adverse decision could force us to either obtainthird-party licenses at a material cost or cease using the technology or product in dispute. 15  We have filed applications for United States and foreign patents coveringcertain aspects of our technology, but there is no assurance that pending patents will issue or as to the degree of protection which anyowned patent might afford. Lawsuits, including patent infringements, in the biotechnology industryare not uncommon. If we become involved in any significant litigation, we would suffer as a result of the diversion of our management’sattention, the expense of litigation and any judgments against us. In addition to intellectual property litigation for infringement, othersubstantial, complex or extended litigation could result in large expenditures by us and distraction of our management. Patent litigationis time-consuming and costly in its own right and could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties. In addition, an adversedecision could force us to either obtain third-party licenses at a material cost or cease using the technology or product in dispute.In addition, lawsuits by employees, stockholders, collaborators or distributors could be very costly and substantially disrupt our business.Disputes from time to time with companies or individuals are not uncommon in the biotechnology industry, and we cannot assure you thatwe will always be able to resolve them out of court. We also utilize certain unpatented proprietary technology and no assurancecan be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary technology, that such proprietary technologywill not be disclosed or that we can meaningfully protect our rights to such proprietary technology.  Our business is subject to governmental laws and regulations. Changesin the way the FDA regulates the reagents, and other consumables we use when developing, validating, and performing our tests could resultin delay or additional expense in bringing our tests to market or performing such tests for our customers. We may be unable toobtain or maintain regulatory approvals for our diagnostic products, which could reduce our revenue or prevent us from earning a returnon our research and development expenditures. Our research, preclinical development, product manufacturing and marketingare subject to regulation by the FDA and similar health authorities in foreign countries. The FDA has regulatory responsibility over,among other areas, instruments, software, test kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories to perform diagnostic testingin the U.S. The tests we develop internally are offered as lab developed tests or LDTs. The FDA has claimed regulatory authority overall LDTs, but has stated that it exercised enforcement discretion with regard to most LDTs performed by high complexity CLIA-certifiedlaboratories. As the FDA moves to regulate more clinical laboratory testing, its approach to regulation is impacting industry practicesand participants, new competitors may enter the industry, and competition may come in new forms. In late 2018, legislation was introducedin Congress that would enable the FDA to regulate LDTs, in vitro diagnostics, software and other items used in the diagnosis of disease.If this legislation were to become law, the FDA could regulate diagnostic tests and components and platforms used as part of these tests.If such legislation were to become law, it could have a significant impact on the clinical laboratory testing industry, including regulatingLDTs in new ways and creating avenues of opportunity and competition regarding clinical laboratory testing. New competitors may enterthe industry, and competition may come in new forms. Pursuant to the 21st Century Cures Act, the FDA issued guidance regarding its positionon the regulation of clinical decision software, which may be used in, or in connection with, LDTs. The guidance attempts to clarify whetherFDA approval of certain software is required. In January 2019, the FDA issued draft guidance on a pre-certification pilot program to helpsoftware developers have a speedier and less restrictive path to clearance or approval of their software. We cannot be sure that we can obtain necessary regulatory approvalson a timely basis, if at all, for any of the products we are developing or manufacturing or that we can maintain necessary regulatoryapprovals for our existing products, and all of the following could have a material adverse effect on our business: ●significantdelays in obtaining or failing to obtain required approvals; ●lossof, or changes to, previously obtained approvals; ●failureto comply with existing or future regulatory requirements and; ●changes to manufacturing processes, manufacturing process standardsor GMP following approval or changing interpretations of these factors. 16  Adverse perception and increased regulatory scrutiny of gene medicineand genetic research might limit our ability to conduct our business. Ethical, social and legal concerns about gene medicine, genetic testingand genetic research could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting the technologies we or our collaborators may use.Recently, gene medicine studies have come under increasing scrutiny, which has delayed on-going and could delay future clinical trialsand regulatory approvals. Federal and state agencies, congressional committees and foreign governments have expressed interest in furtherregulating biotechnology. More restrictive regulations or claims that our products are unsafe or pose a hazard could prevent us from commercializingany products. Financial Risks We have experienced significant losses in our continuing operationsin fiscal years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022 and our losses have resulted in the use of cash in operations. If such losses and cash usescontinue, the value of your investment could decline significantly. We incurred net losses before income taxes from continuing operationsof $25.0 million and $20.3 million, for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. If our revenues do not increase,or if our operating expenses exceed expectations or cannot be reduced, we may continue to suffer substantial losses and use cash in operationswhich could have an adverse effect on our business and adversely affect your investment in our Company. We have an accumulated deficitof $268.4 million as of July 31, 2023 and net cash used in operating activities was $37.0 million for the fiscal year 2023. We may continueto generate net losses. We believe our cash and cash equivalents at July 31, 2023 are sufficient for our operations and non-discretionarycapital needs for at least twelve months from the filing of this report. Failure to generate additional product revenues at higher margins,obtain additional capital or manage discretionary spending could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operationsand liquidity. Other risks relating to our business Cyber security risks and the failure to maintain the confidentiality,integrity, and availability of our computer hardware, software, and Internet applications and related tools and functions could resultin damage to the Company’s reputation and/or subject the Company to costs, fines, or lawsuits. The integrity and protection of our own data, and that of its customersand employees, is critical to the Company’s business. The regulatory environment governing information, security and privacy lawsis increasingly demanding and continues to evolve. Maintaining compliance with applicable security and privacy regulations may increasethe Company’s operating costs and/or adversely impact the Company’s ability to market its products and services to customers.Although the Company’s computer and communications hardware is protected through physical and software safeguards, it is still vulnerableto fire, storm, flood, power loss, earthquakes, telecommunications failures, physical or software break-ins, software viruses, and similarevents. These events could lead to the unauthorized access, disclosure and use of non-public information. The techniques used by criminalelements to attack computer systems are sophisticated, change frequently and may originate from less regulated and remote areas of theworld. As a result, the Company may not be able to address these techniques proactively or implement adequate preventative measures. Ifthe Company’s computer systems are compromised, it could be subject to fines, damages, litigation, and enforcement actions, customerscould curtail or cease using its applications, and the Company could lose trade secrets, the occurrence of which could harm its business. 17  We rely on network and information systems and other technologywhose failure or misuse could cause, and has caused, a disruption of services or loss or improper disclosure of personal data, businessinformation, including intellectual property, or other confidential information, resulting in increased costs, loss of revenue or otherharm to our business. Network and information systems and othertechnologies, including those related to the Company’s network management, are important to its business activities. The Companyalso relies on third party providers for certain technology and “cloud-based” systems and services that support a varietyof business operations. Network and information systems-related events affecting the Company’s systems, or those of third partiesupon which the Company’s business relies, such as computer compromises, cyber threats and attacks, ransomware attacks, computerviruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineeringor other malicious activities, or any combination of the foregoing, as well as power outages, equipment failure, natural disasters (includingextreme weather), terrorist activities, war, human or technological error or malfeasance that may affect such systems, could result indisruption of the Company’s business and/or loss, corruption or improper disclosure of personal data, business information, includingintellectual property, or other confidential information. In addition, any design or manufacturing defects in, or the improper implementationof, hardware or software applications the Company develops or procures from third parties could unexpectedly compromise information security.In recent years, there has been a rise in the number of cyber-attacks and ransomware attacks on companies’ network and informationsystems, and such attacks have become more sophisticated, targeted and difficult to detect and prevent. As a result, the risks associatedwith such an event continue to increase, particularly as the Company’s digital businesses expand. The Company’s security measuresand internal controls that are designed to protect personal data, business information, including intellectual property, and other confidentialinformation, to prevent data loss, and to prevent or detect security breaches, have not always provided, and cannot provide, absolutesecurity and have at times failed and may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring, particularly given that techniquesused to access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, and any network and information systems-related eventshave required and could continue to require the Company to expend significant resources to remedy such event. Moreover, the developmentand maintenance of these measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcomesecurity measures become more sophisticated. The Company’s cyber risk insurance may not be sufficient to cover all losses from anyfuture breaches of our systems. A significant cyber attack, ransomware attack,failure, compromise, breach or interruption of the Company’s systems, or those of third parties upon which its business relies,could result in a disruption of its operations, customer, audience or advertiser dissatisfaction, damage to its reputation or brands,regulatory investigations and enforcement actions, lawsuits, remediation costs, a loss of customers, advertisers or revenues and otherfinancial losses. If any such failure, interruption or similar event results in the improper disclosure of information maintained in theCompany’s information systems and networks or those of its vendors, including financial, personal, credit card, confidential andproprietary information relating to personnel, customers, vendors and the Company’s business, including its intellectual property,the Company could also be subject to liability under relevant contractual obligations and laws and regulations protecting personal dataand privacy. In addition, media or other reports of perceived security vulnerabilities to our systems or those of third parties upon whichthe Company’s business relies, even if nothing has actually been attempted or occurred, could also adversely impact our brand andreputation and materially affect our business. On April 6, 2023, the Company experienceda ransomware attack that impacted certain critical information technology systems. The Company has incurred, and may continue to incur,certain expenses related to this attack and remains subject to risks and uncertainties as a result of the incident. Additionally, securityand privacy incidents have led to, and may continue to lead to, additional regulatory scrutiny and class action litigation exposure. Thisincident severely curtailed our ability to perform clinical reference testing and we were forced to outsource much of the testing to thirdparties, including Labcorp, which negatively impacted the 2023 period’s services revenue and increased costs due to a higher volumeof outsourcing testing to third parties in the discontinued operations. See Note 17 Contingencies for additional information. If we fail to attract and retain key personnel, including our seniormanagement, our business could be adversely affected. Most of our products and services are highly technical in nature. Ingeneral, only highly qualified and trained scientists and technician personnel have the necessary skills to develop proprietary technologicalproducts and market our products and support our research and development programs. 18  In addition, some of our manufacturing, quality control, safety andcompliance, information technology and e-commerce related positions are highly technical as well. Further, our sales personnel are highlytrained and are important to retaining and growing our businesses. Our success depends in large part upon our ability to identify, hire,retain and motivate highly skilled professionals. We face intense competition for these professionals from our competitors,customers, marketing partners and other companies throughout the industries in which we compete. Since our inception we have successfullyrecruited and hired qualified key employees. Any failure on our part to hire, train, and retain a sufficient number of qualified professionalswould seriously damage our business. We depend heavily on the services of our senior management. We believethat our future success depends on the continued services of such management. Our business may be harmed by the loss of a significantnumber of our senior management in a short period of time. The insurance we purchase to cover our potential business risk maybe inadequate. Although we believe that our present insurance coverage is sufficientto cover our current estimated exposures, we cannot assure that we will not incur losses or liabilities in excess of our policy limits.In addition, although we believe that will be able to continue to obtain adequate coverage, we cannot assure that we will be able to doso at acceptable costs. We are, and may become subject to, legalproceedings, arbitration proceedings, investigations, and other claims or disputes, which are costly to defend and, if determinedadversely to us, could require us to pay fines or damages, undertake remedial measures, or prevent us from taking certain actions, anyof which could adversely affect our business. We are, and in the futuremay become, a party to legal proceedings, arbitration proceedings, investigations, and other claims or disputes, which have related andmay relate to subjects including our recent ransomware attack and data breach, breach of fiduciary duties relating to our commercial transactions,intellectual property, securities, employee relations, or compliance with applicable laws and regulations (see Part I - Item 3, LegalProceedings). We face a significantrisk due to ongoing litigation that has the potential to result in future financial obligations, adversely impacting the company’sbusiness and profitability. The outcome of the present legal proceedings may lead to financial liabilities, such as settlements or damages,posing a material threat to our financial condition and cash flow. Moreover, adverse litigation outcomes may harm our reputation, affectingcustomer trust and investor confidence, thereby influencing market share and brand value. While we are actively managing and addressingthe litigation, uncertainties persist, emphasizing the importance of transparency in communication with stakeholders and the implementationof effective risk mitigation strategies. Risks relating to our international operations Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affectour business. Since we operate as a multinational corporation that sells and sourcesproducts in many different countries, changes in exchange rates could in the future, adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations. Furthermore, reported sales and purchases made in non-U.S. currenciesby our international businesses, when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes, fluctuate due to exchange rate movement.Due to the number of currencies involved, the variability of currency exposures and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates,we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on future sales and operating results. 19  We are subject to economic, political and other risks associatedwith our significant international business, which could adversely affect our financial results. We operate internationally primarily through wholly-owned subsidiarieslocated in North America and Europe. Revenues outside the United States were approximately 40% of total revenues in fiscal year 2023.Our sales and earnings could be adversely affected by a variety of factors resulting from our international operations, including  ●future fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;    ●complex regulatory requirements and changes in those requirements;    ●trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;    ●multiple jurisdictions and differing tax laws, as well as changes in those laws;    ●restrictions on our ability to repatriate investments and earnings from foreign operations;    ●changes in the political or economic conditions in a country or region, including the actual and potential impact Brexit has on our UK operations;    ●changes in shipping costs; and    ●difficulties in collecting on accounts receivable. If any of these risks materialize, we could face substantial increasesin costs, the reduction of profit and the inability to do business.  With our commercialization activities outside of the United States,we are subject to the risk of inadvertently conducting activities in a manner that violates the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act andsimilar laws. If that occurs, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business,financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”),which prohibits corporations and individuals from paying, offering to pay, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreigngovernment official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or tootherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. We are also subject to the UK Anti-Bribery Act, which prohibits both domesticand international bribery, as well as bribery across both public and private sectors. In the course of establishing and expanding our commercial operationsand seeking regulatory approvals outside of the United States, we will need to establish and expand business relationships with variousthird parties and we will interact more frequently with foreign officials, including regulatory authorities. Expanded programs to maintaincompliance with such laws will be costly and may not be effective. Any interactions with any such parties or individuals where compensationis provided that are found to be in violation of such laws could result in substantial fines and penalties and could materially harm ourbusiness. Furthermore, any finding of a violation under one country’s laws may increase the likelihood that we will be prosecutedand be found to have violated another country’s laws. If our business practices outside the United States are found to be in violationof the FCPA, UK Anti-Bribery Act or other similar law, we may be subject to significant civil and criminal penalties which could havea material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Risks Relating to our Common Stock Our stock price has been volatile, which could result in substantiallosses for investors. Our common stock is quoted on the New York Stock Exchange, and therehas been historical volatility in the market price of our common stock. The trading price of our common stock has been, and is likelyto continue to be, subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors, including:  ●fluctuations in our quarterly operating and earnings per share results;    ●the gain or loss of significant contracts;    ●loss of key personnel;    ●announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors;    ●delays in the development and introduction of new products;    ●legislative or regulatory changes;    ●general trends in the industries we operate;    ●recommendations and/or changes in estimates by equity and market research analysts;    ●biological or medical discoveries; 20   ●disputes and/or developments concerning intellectual property, including patents and litigation matters;    ●public concern as to the safety of new technologies;    ●sales of common stock of existing holders;    ●securities class action or other litigation;    ●developments in our relationships with current or future customers and suppliers and;    ●general economic conditions, both in the United States and worldwide. In addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme priceand volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of our common stock, as well as the stock of many companies in our industries.Often, price fluctuations are unrelated to operating performance of the specific companies whose stock is affected. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price ofa company’s stock, securities class action litigation has occurred against the issuing company. If we were subject to this typeof litigation in the future, we could incur substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources, eachof which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings. Any adverse determination in this type of litigation couldalso subject us to significant liabilities. Because we have not and may never pay cash dividends on our commonstock, an investor in our common stock may only benefit if it appreciates in value. We currently intend to retain our retained earnings and future earnings,if any, to finance the expansion of our business and may not pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Asa result, the success of an investment in our common stock may depend entirely upon any future appreciation. There is no guarantee thatour common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which investors purchased their shares. It may be difficult for a third party to acquire us, which couldinhibit stockholders from realizing a premium on their stock price. Our certificate of incorporation, as amended, and by-laws contain provisionsthat could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us that stockholders may consider favorable orbeneficial due to a majority stockholder vote requirement. These provisions could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficultfor stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions could also limit the price that investors mightbe willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. These provisions include advance notice requirements for the submissionby stockholders of nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholdersat a meeting. Future sales of shares of our common stock or the issuance of securitiessenior to our common stock could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our ability to raise funds in new equity offerings. We are not restricted from issuing additional common stock, preferredstock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock. Future sales of a substantial number of our shares of common stockor equity-related securities in the public market or privately, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affectprevailing trading prices of our common stock, and could impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity-relatedsecurities.

 Business Risks Our operating results may vary from period to period. Our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarterand from year to year, depending on a variety of factors including: ●The continued    impact on our operations from the COVID-19 pandemic depending on its severity and duration, competition from larger commercial clinical    laboratories, hospital affiliated laboratories, and physician office laboratories; ●health care    reform regulations affecting providers and plan sponsors, including those stemming from the Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA) or    its repeal, amendment or replacement; ●changes in    reimbursement policies by third party and government payers, especially those stemming from The Protecting Access to Medicare Act    of 2014 (“PAMA”); ●customer demand for our products    due to changes in purchasing requirements and research needs; ●the introduction of new products    by us or our competitors; ●the timing of our research    and development, sales and marketing expenses; ●general worldwide economic    conditions affecting funding of research; ●seasonal fluctuations in revenues    due to the impact of weather and holiday periods ●expenses associated with defending    our intellectual property portfolio ●foreign currency exchange rate    fluctuations; ●changes in tax laws, the results    of tax audits or the measurement of tax uncertainties; and ●the success of identifying,    acquiring and integrating businesses that complement our product offerings, add new technology or add presence in a market; Consequently, results for any interim or full year period may notnecessarily be indicative of results in subsequent periods. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly and adversely affected ourconsolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows during fiscal 2020. Though our operations recovered in fiscal 2021,the pandemic may adversely affect future operations depending on the severity and duration of the pandemic, its impact on the U.S. healthcaresystem and the timing, scope and effectiveness of federal, state and local governmental responses to the pandemic. The novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”)and its variants continue to spread and impact the economy of the United States and other countries around the world. The Company hasmade substantial investments to expand the amount of COVID-19 testing available and is currently offering direct testing at its drive-throughtesting facilities as well as accepting tests for processing at its clinical laboratory. The Company and its employees are committedto being a part of the coordinated public and private sector response to this unprecedented challenge. The Company also put preparednessplans in place at its facilities to maintain continuity of operations, while also taking steps to keep colleagues and customers healthyand safe. 32  While the rate of transmission of COVID-19 fluctuates in the US andEurope, it continues to spread in other parts of the world and negatively impact the world economy. Federal, state and local governmentalpolicies and initiatives designed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 have resulted in, among other things, a significant reductionin physician office visits, the cancellation of elective medical procedures, customers of our products remaining closed or continuingto severely curtail their operations (voluntarily or in response to government orders), and the continuation of work-from-home or shelter-in-placepolicies. The COVID-19 impact on the Company’s operations is consistent with the overall industry and publicly issued statementsfrom competitors, partners, and vendors. During the fiscal years ended July 31, 2021 and 2020, COVID-19 testingrevenues represented 48% and 8%, respectively of Clinical Services revenues. Enzo applied its technical expertise in molecular diagnosticsto develop next generation COVID-19 diagnostic and antibody testing options which were approved under the FDA Emergency Use Authorization(EUA). This testing had a positive impact on revenue, profitability and cash flow throughout fiscal 2021. However, it is too early todetermine the long term significance of any positive impact from increased COVID-19 testing and our proprietary COVID-19 product offeringson our businesses. The extent to which our businesses may continue to be affected bythe COVID-19 pandemic will largely depend on both current and future developments, including its duration, the emergence and spread ofvariants, its treatment with authorized vaccines and vaccines in various stages of development and federal approval, work and traveladvisories and restrictions, and the timing of their easing, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be reasonably predicted atthis time. Global supply chain issues due to the pandemic continue to hamper both the manufacturing of products within the life sciencesegment as well as testing capabilities in the clinical laboratory. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts the Company’sbusiness and consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows will depend on numerous evolving factors including,but not limited to: the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the extent to which it will impact worldwide macroeconomic conditionsincluding, but not limited to, employment rates and health insurance coverage, the speed of the anticipated recovery, and governmentaland business reactions to the pandemic. These factors are beyond the Company’s knowledge and control, and as a result, at thistime the Company cannot reasonably estimate the adverse impact the COVID-19 pandemic will have on its businesses but the adverse impactcould be material. The Company assessed certain accounting matters that generally require consideration of forecasted financial informationin context with the information reasonably available to the Company and the unknown future impacts of COVID-19 as of July 31, 2021 andthrough the date of this report. The accounting matters assessed included, but were not limited to, the Company’s patient self-payrevenue concessions and credit losses in the Clinical Services segment, accounts receivable, inventories and the carrying value of goodwilland other long-lived assets. The Company’s future assessment of the magnitude and duration of COVID-19, as well as other factors,could result in additional material impacts to the Company’s consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods. Weexpect COVID-19 volume to decline in the quarters ahead as the percentage of Americans who are vaccinated increases. However, the emergenceand spread of variants may cause our COVID-19 testing volume to increase again. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has moderated and the business andsocial distancing restrictions have eased, we may continue to experience similar adverse effects to our businesses, consolidated resultsof operations, financial position and cash flows resulting from a recessionary economic environment that may persist. The impact thatthe COVID-19 pandemic will have on our businesses, consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows could exacerbatethe additional risks identified below. A significant proportion of our Products revenues are from academiccenters, funded by government grants in our major markets globally. Governments around the world have been reviewing long term publicfunding of life science research in response to the problems arising from global financial pressures. As a result, the available fundsfor discretionary purchases from market to market have been capped or reduced based on available National budgets. Reduced grants forresearchers could impact our business, in the amount, price and type of products bought and used by customers. A significant proportion of our Products revenues are from customersin pharmaceutical and biotech companies. Globally, pharmaceutical companies are challenging internal budgets,and the return of investment from their R&D spend. This could impact our business, in the amount, price and type of products boughtand used by customers. 33  Our future success will depend in part upon our ability to enhanceexisting products, develop and introduce new products and realize commercial acceptance of those products, in a rapidly changing technologicalenvironment. The market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology,evolving industry standards and new product introductions, which may make our existing products obsolete. Our future success will dependin part upon our ability to enhance existing products, develop and introduce new products, and realize commercial acceptance of thoseproducts. The development of new or enhanced products is a complex and uncertainprocess requiring the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends as well as precise technological execution. In addition,the successful development of new products will depend on the development of new technologies. We will be required to undertake time-consumingand costly development activities and to seek regulatory approval for these new products. We may experience difficulties that could delayor prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of these new products. Regulatory clearance or approval of any newproducts may not be granted by the FDA, state-wide agency or foreign regulatory authorities on a timely basis, or at all, and the newproducts may not be successfully commercialized. We may be unable to identify, acquire and integrate acquisitiontargets. Our strategy envisions, if an opportunistic targetis identified, future growth from acquiring and integrating similar operations and/or product or services lines. There can be no assurancethat we will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates and, once identified, to negotiate successfully their acquisition ata price or on terms and conditions favorable to us, or to integrate the operations of such acquired businesses with the existing operations.In addition, we compete for acquisition candidates with other entities, some of which have greater financial resources than ours. Failureto implement successfully our acquisition strategy would limit our potential growth. Our inability to carry out certain of our marketing and sales plansmay make it difficult for us to grow or maintain our business. The Life Sciences product segment continues a marketing program designedto more directly service its end users, while simultaneously promoting the Enzo Life Science brand, with reference to our acquired brands.We will continue to reach out to our customers using our direct field sales force, in-house business team, the on-going enhancement ofour interactive websites, continued attendance at top industry trade meetings, and publications to customers and in leading scientificjournals. In addition to our direct sales, we operate worldwide through wholly-owned subsidiaries (in USA, Switzerland, Belgium, Germany,and the UK), a branch office in France and a network of third-party distributors in most other significant markets. If we are unableto successfully continue these programs, we may be unable to grow and our business could suffer.  We face significant competition, which could cause us todecrease the prices for our products or services or render our products uneconomical or obsolete, any of which could reduce our revenuesand limit our growth. Our competitors in the biotechnology industry in the United Statesand abroad are numerous and include major pharmaceutical, energy, food and chemical companies, as well as specialized genetic engineeringfirms. Many of our large competitors have substantially greater resources than us and have the capability of developing products whichcompete directly with our products. Many of these companies are performing research in the same areas as we are. The markets for ourproducts are also subject to competitive risks because markets are highly price competitive. Our competitors have competed in the pastby lowering prices on certain products. The clinical laboratory services business is highly fragmented andintensely competitive, and we compete with numerous national and local companies. Some of these entities are larger than we are and havegreater resources than we do. We compete primarily on the basis of the quality of our testing, reporting and information services, ourreputation in the medical community, the pricing of our services and our ability to employ qualified professionals. 34  These competitive conditions could, among other things: ●require us to reduce our prices    to retain market share;  ●require us to increase our    marketing efforts which could reduce our profit margins;  ●increase our cost of labor    to attract qualified personnel;  ●render our biotechnology products    uneconomical or obsolete or;  ●reduce our revenue Ethical, legal and social concerns surrounding the use of geneticinformation could reduce demand for our products. Genetic testing has raised ethical issues regarding privacy and theappropriate uses of the resulting information. For these reasons, governmental authorities may call for limits on or regulation of theuse of genetic testing or prohibit testing for genetic predisposition to certain conditions, particularly for those that have no knowncure. Similarly, such concerns may lead individuals to refuse to use genetics tests even if permissible. Any of these scenarios couldreduce the potential markets for our molecular diagnostic products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financialcondition and results of operations. We depend on distributors and contract manufacturers and suppliersfor materials that could impair our ability to manufacture or distribute our products. We manufacture and distribute our own brand products and the productsof third party manufacturers and suppliers. Distributors also sell our branded products. To the extent we are unable to maintain or replacea distributor in a reasonable time period, or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, our operations could be disrupted. Outside distributors, suppliers and contract manufacturers providekey finished goods, components and raw materials used in the sale and manufacture of our products. Although we believe that alternativesources for components and raw materials are available, any supply interruption in a limited or sole source component or raw materialwould harm our ability to manufacture our products until a new source of supply is identified and qualified. In addition, an uncorrecteddefect or supplier’s variation in a component or raw material, either unknown to us or incompatible with our manufacturing process,could harm our ability to manufacture products. We might not be able to find a sufficient alternative supplier in a reasonable time period,or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we fail to obtain a supplier for the components of our products, our operations couldbe disrupted. We use hazardous materials in our business. Any claims relatingto improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials could be costly and time-consuming. Our manufacturing, clinical laboratory and research and developmentprocesses involve the storage, use and disposal of hazardous substances, including hazardous chemicals, biological hazardous materialsand radioactive compounds. We are subject to governmental regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposalof materials and waste products. Although we believe that our safety and environmental management practices and procedures for handlingand disposing of these hazardous materials are in accordance with good industry practice and comply with applicable laws, permits, licensesand regulations, the risk of accidental environmental or human contamination or injury from the release or exposure of hazardous materialscannot be completely eliminated. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result, including environmentalclean-up or decontamination costs, and any such liability could exceed the limits of, or fall outside the coverage of, our insurance. We may not be able to maintain insurance on acceptable terms, or atall. We could be required to incur significant costs to comply with current or future environmental and public and workplace safety andhealth laws and regulations. 35  We are required to expend significant resources for research anddevelopment for our products in development and these products may not be developed successfully. Failure to successfully develop theseproducts may prevent us from earning a return on our research and development expenditures. The products we are developing are at various stages of developmentand clinical evaluations and may require further technical development and investment to determine whether commercial application ispracticable. There can be no assurance that our efforts will result in products with valuable commercial applications. Our cash requirementsmay vary materially from current estimates because of results of our research and development programs, competitive and technologicaladvances and other factors. In any event, we will require substantial funds to conduct development activities and pre-clinical and clinicaltrials, apply for regulatory approvals and commercialize products, if any, that are developed. We do not have any commitments or arrangements to obtain any additionalfinancing and there is no assurance that required financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. Even if we spendsubstantial amounts on research and development, our potential products may not be developed successfully. If our product candidates on which we have expended significant amountsfor research and development are not commercialized, we will not earn a return on our research and development expenditures, which mayharm our business. We rely on network and information systems and other technologywhose failure or misuse could cause a disruption of services or loss or improper disclosure of personal data, business information, includingintellectual property, or other confidential information, resulting in increased costs, loss of revenue or other harm to our business. Network and information systems and other technologies, includingthose related to the Company’s network management, are important to its business activities. The Company also relies on third partyproviders for certain technology and “cloud-based” systems and services that support a variety of business operations. Networkand information systems-related events affecting the Company’s systems, or those of third parties upon which the Company’sbusiness relies, such as computer compromises, cyber threats and attacks, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptivesoftware, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious activities, or any combinationof the foregoing, as well as power outages, equipment failure, natural disasters (including extreme weather), terrorist activities, war,human or technological error or malfeasance that may affect such systems, could result in disruption of the Company’s businessand/or loss, corruption or improper disclosure of personal data, business information, including intellectual property, or other confidentialinformation. In addition, any design or manufacturing defects in, or the improper implementation of, hardware or software applicationsthe Company develops or procures from third parties could unexpectedly compromise information security. In recent years, there has beena rise in the number of cyber-attacks on companies’ network and information systems, and such attacks have become more sophisticated,targeted and difficult to detect and prevent against. As a result, the risks associated with such an event continue to increase, particularlyas the Company’s digital businesses expand. While the Company has developed and implemented security measures and internal controlsthat are designed to protect personal data, business information, including intellectual property, and other confidential information,to prevent data loss, and to prevent or detect security breaches, such security measures cannot provide absolute security and may notbe successful in preventing these events from occurring, particularly given that techniques used to access, disable or degrade service,or sabotage systems change frequently, and any network and information systems-related events could require the Company to expend significantresources to remedy such event. Moreover, the development and maintenance of these measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoringand updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. While the Company maintainscyber risk insurance, this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all losses from any future breaches of our systems. A significant failure, compromise, breach or interruption of the Company’ssystems, or those of third parties upon which its business relies, could result in a disruption of its operations, customer, audienceor advertiser dissatisfaction, damage to its reputation or brands, regulatory investigations and enforcement actions, lawsuits, remediationcosts, a loss of customers, advertisers or revenues and other financial losses. If any such failure, interruption or similar event resultsin the improper disclosure of information maintained in the Company’s information systems and networks or those of its vendors,including financial, personal, credit card, confidential and proprietary information relating to personnel, customers, vendors and theCompany’s business, including its intellectual property, the Company could also be subject to liability under relevant contractualobligations and laws and regulations protecting personal data and privacy. In addition, media or other reports of perceived securityvulnerabilities to our systems or those of third parties upon which the Company’s business relies, even if nothing has actuallybeen attempted or occurred, could also adversely impact our brand and reputation and materially affect our business. 36  Risks relating to our Intellectual Property and Regulatory Approval Protecting our proprietary rights is difficult and costly. If wefail to adequately protect or enforce our proprietary rights, we could lose potential revenue from licensing and royalties. Our potential revenue and success depends in large part on our abilityto obtain, maintain and enforce our patents. Our ability to commercialize any product successfully will largely depend on our abilityto obtain and maintain patents of sufficient scope to prevent third parties from developing similar or competitive products. In the absenceof patent protection, competitors may impact our business by developing and marketing substantially equivalent products and technology. Patent disputes are frequent and can preclude the commercializationof products. We have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be, involved in material patent litigation, such as the mattersdiscussed under “Part I - Item 3. Legal Proceedings” in this report. Patent protection litigation is time-consuming and wehave incurred and anticipate continuing to incur significant legal costs. In addition, an adverse decision could force us to either obtainthird-party licenses at a material cost or cease using the technology or product in dispute. We have filed applications for United States and foreign patents coveringcertain aspects of our technology, but there is no assurance that pending patents will issue or as to the degree of protection whichany issued patent might afford. Lawsuits, including patent infringements, in the biotechnologyindustry are not uncommon. If we become involved in any significant litigation, we would suffer as a result of the diversion of our management’sattention, the expense of litigation and any judgments against us. In addition to intellectual property litigation for infringement,other substantial, complex or extended litigation could result in large expenditures by us and distraction of our management. Patentlitigation is time-consuming and costly in its own right and could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties. In addition,an adverse decision could force us to either obtain third-party licenses at a material cost or cease using the technology or productin dispute. In addition, lawsuits by employees, stockholders, collaborators or distributors could be very costly and substantially disruptour business. Disputes from time to time with companies or individuals are not uncommon in the biotechnology industry, and we cannotassure you that we will always be able to resolve them out of court. We also utilize certain unpatented proprietary technology and no assurancecan be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary technology, that such proprietary technologywill not be disclosed or that we can meaningfully protect our rights to such proprietary technology. 37  Our business is subject to governmental laws andregulations. Changes in the way the FDA regulates the reagents, and other consumables we use when developing, validating, and performingour tests could result in delay or additional expense in bringing our tests to market or performing such tests for our customers. Wemay be unable to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals for our products, which could reduce our revenue or prevent us from earning areturn on our research and development expenditures. Our research, preclinical development, clinical trials, product manufacturingand marketing are subject to regulation by the FDA and similar health authorities in foreign countries. The FDA has regulatory responsibilityover, among other areas, instruments, software, test kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories to perform diagnostictesting in the U.S. The tests we develop internally are offered as lab developed tests or LDTs. The FDA has claimed regulatory authorityover all LDTs, but has stated that it exercised enforcement discretion with regard to most LDTs performed by high complexity CLIA-certifiedlaboratories. As the FDA moves to regulate more clinical laboratory testing, its approach to regulation is impacting industry practicesand participants, new competitors may enter the industry, and competition may come in new forms. In late 2018, legislation was introducedin Congress that would enable the FDA to regulate LDTs, in vitro diagnostics, software and other items used in the diagnosis of disease.If this legislation were to become law, the FDA could regulate diagnostic tests and components and platforms used as part of these tests.If such legislation were to become law, it could have a significant impact on the clinical laboratory testing industry, including regulatingLDTs in new ways and creating avenues of opportunity and competition regarding clinical laboratory testing. New competitors may enterthe industry, and competition may come in new forms. Pursuant to the 21st Century Cures Act, the FDA issued guidance regarding its positionon the regulation of clinical decision software, which may be used in, or in connection with, LDTs. The guidance attempts to clarifywhether FDA approval of certain software is required. In January 2019 the FDA issued draft guidance on a pre-certification pilot programto help software developers have a speedier and less restrictive path to clearance or approval of their software. We cannot be sure that we can obtain necessary regulatory approvalson a timely basis, if at all, for any of the products we are developing or manufacturing or that we can maintain necessary regulatoryapprovals for our existing products, and all of the following could have a material adverse effect on our business: ●significant delays in obtaining or failing to obtain    required approvals;  ●loss of, or changes to, previously obtained approvals;  ●failure to comply with existing or future regulatory    requirements and;  ●changes to manufacturing processes, manufacturing process    standards or Good Manufacturing Practices following approval or changing interpretations of these factors. Adverse perception and increased regulatory scrutiny of gene medicineand genetic research might limit our ability to conduct our business. Ethical, social and legal concerns about gene medicine, genetic testingand genetic research could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting the technologies we or our collaborators may use.Recently, gene medicine studies have come under increasing scrutiny, which has delayed on-going and could delay future clinical trialsand regulatory approvals. Federal and state agencies, congressional committees and foreign governments have expressed interest in furtherregulating biotechnology. More restrictive regulations or claims that our products are unsafe or pose a hazard could prevent us fromcommercializing any products. Financial Risks With the exception of fiscal years 2021 and 2019, we have experiencedsignificant losses in our previous five fiscal years and quarter to quarter over such periods and our losses have resulted in the useof cash in operations. If such losses and cash uses continue, the value of your investment could decline significantly. Although for fiscal years 2021 and 2019, when we reported net incomeof $7.9 million and $2.5 million, respectively, we incurred net losses of $28.5 million, $11.4 million, and $2.5 million for the fiscalyears ended July 31, 2020, 2018 and 2017 respectively. If our revenues do not increase, or if our operating expenses exceed expectationsor cannot be reduced, we will continue to suffer substantial losses and use cash in operations which could have an adverse effect onour business and adversely affect your investment in our Company. 38  We may need additional capital to fund growth, which may not beavailable on acceptable terms or at all, and could result in our business plan being limited and our business being harmed. Our ability to increase revenue and improve profitability and liquiditywill depend in part on our ability to grow our products business with higher margin products and increase our market share and continueto grow the Laboratory Services business with new tests with higher reimbursements and increase our service volume which may requiresignificant additional capital that may not be available to us. We may need additional financing due to future developments, changesin our business plan or failure of our current business plan to succeed, which could result from increased marketing, distribution orresearch and development costs. Our actual funding requirements could vary materially from our current estimates. If additional financingis needed, we may not be able to raise sufficient funds on favorable terms or at all. If we issue common stock or securities convertibleinto common stock in the future, such issuance will result in the then-existing stockholders sustaining dilution to their relative proportionof our outstanding equity. If we fail to obtain any necessary financing on a timely basis, then our ability to execute our current businessplan may be limited, and our business, liquidity and financial condition could be harmed. Our outstanding debt may impair our financial and operating flexibilityand a failure to satisfy the covenants under agreements governing our outstanding debt could limit the availability of borrowings orresult in an event of default under such agreements. The Company had $13.5 million in cash, cashequivalents and restricted cash and $30.0 million in short term investments in bond funds on its balance sheet as of July 31, 2021. Alsoas of that date, we had approximately $3.4 million of short term debt and $18.9 million in long term debt. The short term debt is primarilyrelated to operating leases. The long term debt is primarily related to operating leases and a ten-year mortgage obligation of approximately$4.1 million with Citibank, N.A., which bears a fixed interest rate of 5.09% per annum and contains various restrictive covenants. Theserestrictions could limit our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must use a portion of thesefunds to make principal and interest payments on our debt. Our ability to comply with the restrictive financial ratio and liquidity covenantsin the mortgage debt agreement will depend upon our future performance and various other factors, including but not limited to the impacton our business, consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, any prolongedrecessionary economic environment that may develop and competitive and regulatory factors, many of which are beyond our control. We maynot be able to maintain compliance with all of the covenants. In that event, we may not be able to find and access any otherborrowing availability and we may need to seek waivers to the covenants or amendments to the mortgage agreement or would need to refinancethe mortgage. There can be no assurance that we can obtain additional waivers of our mortgage agreement covenants, or be able to refinanceit, and, even if we were able to obtain a waiver or additional amendment in the future, such relief may only last for a limited period.Any noncompliance by us with the covenants under our mortgage agreement could result in an event of default under the agreement, whichmay allow the lender to accelerate payment of the mortgage. In the event our creditor accelerates the repayment of our mortgage, we cannotassure that we would have sufficient assets to make such repayment. We may incur impairment charges on our goodwill and intangibleswhich would reduce our earnings. We are subject to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ASC350, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (“ASC 350”) which requires that goodwill and other intangible assets that havean indefinite life be tested at least annually for impairment. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives must also betested for impairment between the annual tests if a triggering event occurs that would likely reduce the fair value of the asset belowits carrying amount. Intangible assets with finite lives are assessed for impairment when, and if, an indicator of potential impairmentis identified. As of July 31, 2021 and 2020, goodwill and finite lived intangibleassets represented approximately 7% of our total assets. If we determine that there has been impairment, our financial results for therelevant period would be reduced by the amount of the impairment, net of tax effects, if any. The Company has no intangible assets withindefinite lives. 39  Risks relating to our Clinical Laboratory Services segment The clinical testing business is highly competitive, and if wefail to provide an appropriately priced level of service or otherwise fail to compete effectively it could have a material adverse effecton our revenues and profitability. The clinical testing business is a fragmented and highly competitiveindustry. We primarily compete with three types of clinical testing providers: other commercial clinical laboratories, hospital-affiliatedlaboratories and physician-office laboratories. We also compete with other providers, including anatomic pathology practices and largephysician group practices. Hospitals generally maintain on-site laboratories to perform testing on their patients (inpatient or outpatient).In addition, many hospitals compete with commercial clinical laboratories for outreach (non-hospital patients) testing. Hospitals mayseek to leverage their relationships with community clinicians and encourage the clinicians to send their outreach testing to the hospital’slaboratory. As a result of this affiliation between hospitals and community clinicians, we compete against hospital-affiliated laboratoriesprimarily based on quality and scope of service as well as pricing. In addition, hospitals that own physician practices may require thepractices to refer testing to the hospital’s laboratory. In recent years, there has been a trend of hospitals acquiring physicianpractices, increasing the percentage of physician practices owned by hospitals. Increased hospital ownership of physician practices mayenhance clinician ties to hospital-affiliated laboratories and may strengthen their competitive position. The diagnostic informationservices industry also is faced with changing technology and new product introductions. Competitors may compete using advanced technology,including technology that enables more convenient or cost-effective testing. Competitors also may compete on the basis of new serviceofferings. Competitors also may offer testing to be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory, such as (1) point-of-caretesting that can be performed by physicians in their offices; (2) advanced testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories;and (3) home testing that can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers. Our clinical laboratory services business is subject to extensivegovernment regulation and our loss of any required certifications or licenses could require us to cease operating this part of our business,which would reduce our revenue and injure our reputation. The clinical laboratory industry is subject to significant governmentalregulation at the Federal, state and local levels. Under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act of 1967 and the Clinical LaboratoryImprovement Amendments of 1988 (collectively, as amended, “CLIA”) virtually all clinical laboratories, including ours, mustbe certified by the Federal government. Many clinical laboratories also must meet other governmental standards, undergo proficiency testingand are subject to inspection. Certifications or licenses are also required by various state and local laws. The failure of our clinicallaboratory to obtain or maintain such certifications or licenses under these laws could interrupt our ability to operate our clinicallaboratory business and injure our reputation. Reimbursements from third-party payers including managed care organizationsand Medicare, upon which our clinical laboratory business is dependent, are subject to varying rates and coverage and legislative reformthat are beyond our control. Any reforms that decrease coverage and rates could reduce our earnings and harm our business. Our clinical laboratory services business is primarily dependent uponreimbursement from third-party payers, such as Medicaid, Medicare (which principally serves patients 65 and older) and commercial insurers.We are subject to variances in reimbursement rates among different third-party payers, as well as constant renegotiation of those reimbursementrates. Government and non-government payers have in the past sought, and continue to seek, to reduce and limit utilization and reimbursementof healthcare services, including the areas of clinical and genetic testing. We also are subject to audit by Medicare and the commercialinsurers, which can result in the return of payments made to us under these programs. These variances in reimbursement rates and auditresults could reduce our margins and thus our earnings. The health care industry continues to undergo significant change asthird-party payers’ increase their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of health care services. In an effortto address the problem of increasing health care costs, legislation has been proposed or enacted at both the Federal and state levelsto regulate health care delivery in general and clinical laboratories in particular. Some of the proposals include managed competition,global budgeting and price controls. Changes that decrease reimbursement rates or coverage, or increase administrative burdens on billingthird-party payers could reduce our revenues and increase our expenses. 40  Since each payer makes its own decision as to whether to establisha policy or enter into a contract to cover our tests, as well as the amount it will reimburse for a test, seeking these approvals isa time-consuming and costly process. In addition, the determination by a payer to cover and the amount it will reimburse for our testswill likely be made on an indication by indication basis. To date, we have obtained policy-level reimbursement approval or contractualreimbursement for some indications for our test from a small number of commercial third-party payers, and have not obtained coveragefrom Medicare or any state Medicaid program. Further, we believe that establishing adequate reimbursement from Medicare is an importantfactor in gaining adoption from healthcare providers. Our claims for reimbursement from commercial payers may be denied upon submission,and we must appeal the claims. The appeals process is time consuming and expensive, and may not result in payment. In cases where thereis not a contracted rate for reimbursement, there is typically a greater co-insurance or co-payment requirement from the patient whichmay result in further delay or decreased likelihood of collection. We expect to continue to focus substantial resources on increasingadoption of, and coverage and reimbursement for, our current tests and any future tests we may develop. We believe it may take severalyears to achieve coverage and adequate contracted reimbursement with a majority of third-party payers. However, we cannot predict whether,under what circumstances, or at what payment levels payers will reimburse for our tests. If we fail to establish and maintain broad adoptionof, and coverage and reimbursement for, our tests, our ability to generate revenue could be harmed and our future prospects and our businesscould suffer. Government payers, such as Medicare and Medicaid, have taken stepsto reduce the utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services, including clinical testing services. U.S. healthcare reform legislationmay result in significant change and our business could be adversely impacted if we fail to adapt.  We face efforts by government payers to reduce utilization of andreimbursement for diagnostic information services. We expect efforts to reduce reimbursements, to impose more stringent cost controlsand to reduce utilization of clinical test services will continue. Pursuant to The Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (PAMA),which was implemented in 2018, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) promulgated revised reimbursement rate schedulesfor the years 2018 through 2020 for clinical laboratory testing services provided under Medicare. Reimbursement rates for clinical laboratorytesting were reduced in 2018 and 2019 and were reduced again by approximately 10% in 2020. PAMA calls for further revision of the MedicareClinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (CLFS) for years after 2021, based on future surveys of private payer market rates; reimbursement ratereduction from 2021-23 is capped by PAMA at 15% annually. The CARES Act provided a one year delay of a reimbursement rate reduction of15% for clinical laboratory services provided under Medicare that was scheduled to start January 1, 2021. Private health plans and other third parties have taken steps toreduce the utilization and reimbursement of health services, including clinical testing services. We face efforts by non-governmental third-party payers, includinghealth plans, to reduce utilization of and reimbursement for clinical testing services. Examples include increased use of prior authorizationrequirements and increased denial of coverage for services. Since the passage of ACA, there is increased market activity regarding alternativepayment models, including bundled payment models. We expect continuing efforts by third-party payers, including in their rules, practicesand policies, to reduce reimbursements, to impose more stringent cost controls and to reduce utilization of clinical testing services.The healthcare industry has experienced a trend of consolidation among health insurance plans, resulting in fewer but larger insuranceplans with significant bargaining power to negotiate fee arrangements with healthcare providers, including clinical testing providers.These health plans, and independent physician associations, may demand that clinical testing providers accept discounted fee structuresor assume all or a portion of the financial risk associated with providing testing services to their members through capitated paymentarrangements. Some health plans also are reviewing test coding, evaluating coverage decisions and requiring preauthorization of certaintesting. There are also an increasing number of patients enrolling in consumer driven products and high deductible plans that involvegreater patient cost-sharing. The increased consolidation among health plans also has increased pricing transparency and bargaining powerand the potential adverse impact of ceasing to be a contracted provider with any such insurer. 41  Changes in provider mix, including continued growth in capitatedmanaged-cost health care and changes in certain third party provider agreements could have a material adverse impact on the Company’snet revenues and profitability. Certain third party provider companies have adopted national and regionalprograms which include multiple managed-care reimbursement models. If the Company is unable to participate in these programs or if theCompany would lose a material contract, it could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s net revenues and profitability. The number of individuals covered under managed care contracts orother similar arrangements has grown over the past several years and may continue to grow in the future. In addition, Medicare and othergovernment healthcare programs may continue to shift to managed care. Entities providing managed care coverage have reduced paymentsfor medical services, including clinical laboratory services, in numerous ways such as entering into arrangements under which paymentsto a service provider are capitated, limiting testing to specified procedures, denying payment for services performed without prior authorizationand refusing to increase fees for specified services. These trends reduce our revenues and limit our ability to pass cost increases toour customers. Also, if these or other managed care organizations do not select us as a participating provider, we may lose some or allof that business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Because of competitive pressures, impacts of the economy on patientvisits to our customer physician locations and the complexity and expense of the billing process in our clinical laboratory servicesbusiness, we must obtain new customers while maintaining existing customers to grow our business. Intense competition in the clinical laboratory business, increasingadministrative burdens upon the reimbursement process, reduced patient traffic, and reduced coverage and payments by insurers make itnecessary for us to increase our volume of laboratory services. To do so, we must obtain new customers while retaining existing customers.Our failure to attract new customers or the loss of existing customers or a reduction in business from those customers could significantlyreduce our revenues and impede our ability to grow. Compliance with Medicare administrative policies, including thosepertaining to certain automated blood chemistry profiles, may reduce the reimbursements we receive. Containment of health care costs, including reimbursement for clinicallaboratory services, has been a focus of on-going governmental activity. Clinical laboratories must bill Medicare directly for the servicesprovided to Medicare beneficiaries and may only collect the amounts permitted under this fee schedule. Reimbursement to clinical laboratoriesunder the Medicare Fee Schedule has been steadily declining since its inception. Because a significant portion of our costs is fixed,these Medicare reimbursement reductions and changes have a direct adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows. The development of new, more cost-effective tests that can be performedby our customers or by patients, and the continued internalization of testing by hospitals or physicians, could negatively impact ourtesting volume and revenues. The diagnostic industry is faced with changing technology and newproduct introductions, including technology that enables more convenient or cost-effective testing. Some of our competitors also mayoffer testing to be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory, such as point-of-care testing that can be performed by physiciansin their offices; complex testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories; and home testing that can be carriedout without requiring the services of outside providers. Advances in technology also may lead to the need for less frequenttesting. Further, diagnostic tests approved or cleared by the FDA for home use are automatically deemed to be “waived” testsunder CLIA and may be performed by patients in their homes; test kit manufacturers could seek to increase sales to patients of such testkits. Development of such technology and its use by ourcustomers would reduce the demand for our laboratory-based testing services and negatively impact our revenues. 42  Our business could be harmed from the loss or suspension of a licenseor imposition of a fine or penalties under, or future changes in, or changing interpretations of, CLIA or state laboratory licensinglaws to which we are subject. The clinical laboratory testing industry is subject to extensive federaland state regulation, and many of these statutes and regulations have not been interpreted by the courts. The CLIA amendments are federalregulatory standards that apply to virtually all clinical laboratories (regardless of the location, size or type of laboratory), includingthose operated by physicians in their offices, by requiring that they be certified by the federal government or by a federally approvedaccreditation agency. CLIA does not pre-empt state law, which in some cases may be more stringent than federal law and require additionalpersonnel qualifications, quality control, record maintenance and proficiency testing. The sanction for failure to comply with CLIA andstate requirements may be suspension, revocation or limitation of a laboratory’s CLIA certificate, which is necessary to conductbusiness, as well as significant fines and/or criminal penalties. Several states have similar laws and we may be subject to similar penalties. We cannot assure that applicable statutes and regulations will notbe interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely affect our business.Potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include significant fines and the suspension or loss of various licenses,certificates and authorizations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, compliance with future legislationcould impose additional requirements on us, which may be costly. Our business operations and reputation may be materially impairedif we do not comply with privacy laws or information security policies. In our business, we collect, generate, process or maintain sensitiveinformation, such as patient data and other personal information. If we do use or not adequately safeguard that information in compliancewith applicable requirements under federal, state and international laws, or if it were disclosed to persons or entities that shouldnot have access to it, our business could be materially impaired, our reputation could suffer and we could be subject to fines, penaltiesand litigation. In the event of a data security breach, we may be subject to notification obligations, litigation and governmental investigationor sanctions, and may suffer reputational damage, which could have an adverse impact on our business. We are subject to laws and regulationsregarding protecting the security and privacy of certain healthcare and personal information, including: (a) the federal Health InsurancePortability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) and the regulations thereunder, which establish (i) a complex regulatory framework includingrequirements for safeguarding protected health information and (ii) comprehensive federal standards regarding the uses and disclosuresof protected health information; (b) state laws; and (c) the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation. FDA regulation of laboratory-developed tests, analyte specificreagents, or genetic testing could lead to increased costs and delays in introducing new genetic tests. The FDA has regulatory responsibility over, among other areas, instruments,test kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories to perform diagnostic testing in the U.S. A number of tests we developinternally are offered as lab developed tests (LDTs). The FDA has claimed regulatory authority over all LDTs, but has stated that itexercised enforcement discretion with regard to most LDTs performed by high complexity CLIA-certified laboratories. The FDA has publisheda “Discussion Document” that provides the FDA’s views on legislation to govern LDTs. New legislation could significantlyimpact the clinical laboratory testing business, including by increasing or modifying the regulation of LDTs, hindering our ability todevelop and market new services, causing an increase in the cost of our services, delaying our ability to introduce new tests or hinderingour ability to perform testing. 43  We are subject to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuseand other laws and regulations and could face substantial penalties if we are unable to fully comply with such laws. As a provider of clinical laboratory testing services,we are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state and local laws and regulations governing various aspects of our business.For example, we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by both the federal government and the states inwhich we conduct our business. These healthcare laws and regulations include, for example:  ●federal anti-kickback laws,    which constrain our marketing practices, educational programs, pricing policies, and relationships with healthcare providers or other    entities, including third-party laboratories, by prohibiting, among other things, persons or entities from soliciting, receiving,    offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in return for or to induce either the referral of an individual for,    or the purchase, lease order or recommendation of, any good, facility, item or services for which payment may be made, in whole or    in part, under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;  ●federal civil and criminal    false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting,    or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent,    and which may apply to entities like us to the extent that our interactions with customers may affect their billing or coding practices;  ●HIPAA, which imposes certain    requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information, and also established    federal crimes for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements    in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services, and which imposed certain requirements    relating to privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information;  ●the federal physician self-referral    law, commonly known as the Stark Law, which prohibits a physician from making a referral to an entity for certain designated health    services reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid if the physician (or a member of the physician’s family) has a financial relationship    with the entity, and which also prohibits the submission of any claims for reimbursement for designated health services furnished    pursuant to a prohibited referral;  ●the federal Physician Payment    Sunshine Act, and its implementing regulations, which requires manufacturers of certain drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies    for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions)    to report annually to the United States Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments or other transfers    of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals,    as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members;  ●federal consumer    protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers;    and  ●state law equivalents of each    of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party    payer, including commercial insurers and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances,    many of which differ from each other in significant ways, with differing effects. We are unable to predict what additional federal or state legislationor regulatory initiatives may be enacted in the future regarding our business or the healthcare industry in general, or what effect suchlegislation or regulations may have on us. Federal or state governments may impose additional restrictions or adopt interpretations ofexisting laws that could have an adverse effect on us. 44  We incur significant costs in complying with these laws and regulations.Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some ofour business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations, or our sales techniques or productplacement strategies, are found to be in violation of, or to encourage or assist the violation by third parties of, any of the laws describedabove or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, or if we fail to maintain, renew or obtain necessary permits, licensesand approvals related to our in-house laboratory, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines,exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and futureearnings, suspension or revocation of certifications or licenses that are required to operate our business, injunctions and other associatedremedies, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, denial or withdrawal of product clearances, or private “qui tam”actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business.If we or others determine that any of our existing customer relationships do not comply with applicable laws and regulations, eitherdue to changes in such laws and regulations or evolving interpretations of such laws and regulations, we may be required to renegotiateor terminate such relationships. Any penalties, damages, fines, exclusions, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adverselyaffect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increasedby the fact that many of these laws are broad and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Any action against us forviolation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert ourmanagement’s attention from the operation of our business. Other risks relating to our business If we fail to maintain or monitor our information systems our businessescould be adversely affected. We depend on information systems throughout our Company to controlour manufacturing, inventory, distribution and website and the clinical laboratory services processes for: processing specimens, managinginventory, processing test results and submitting claims, collecting from insurers and patients, responding to inquiries, contributingto our overall internal control processes, maintaining records of our property, plant and equipment, and recording and paying amountsdue vendors and other creditors. If we were to experience a prolonged disruption in our information systems that involve interactionswith customers and suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and/or increased costs, which could adversely affectour business. Cyber security risks and the failure to maintain the confidentiality,integrity, and availability of our computer hardware, software, and Internet applications and related tools and functions could resultin damage to the Company’s reputation and/or subject the Company to costs, fines, or lawsuits. The integrity and protection of our own data, and that of its customersand employees, is critical to the Company’s business. The regulatory environment governing information, security and privacy lawsis increasingly demanding and continues to evolve. Maintaining compliance with applicable security and privacy regulations may increasethe Company’s operating costs and/or adversely impact the Company’s ability to market its products and services to customers.Although the Company’s computer and communications hardware is protected through physical and software safeguards, it is stillvulnerable to fire, storm, flood, power loss, earthquakes, telecommunications failures, physical or software break-ins, software viruses,and similar events. These events could lead to the unauthorized access, disclosure and use of non-public information. The techniquesused by criminal elements to attack computer systems are sophisticated, change frequently and may originate from less regulated and remoteareas of the world. As a result, the Company may not be able to address these techniques proactively or implement adequate preventativemeasures. If the Company’s computer systems are compromised, it could be subject to fines, damages, litigation, and enforcementactions, customers could curtail or cease using its applications, and the Company could lose trade secrets, the occurrence of which couldharm its business.  If we fail to attract and retain key personnel, includingour senior management, our business could be adversely affected. Most of our products and services are highly technical in nature.In general, only highly qualified and trained scientists and technician personnel have the necessary skills to develop proprietary technologicalproducts and market our products, support our research and development programs and provide our clinical laboratory services. In addition, some of our manufacturing, quality control, safety andcompliance, information technology and e-commerce related positions are highly technical as well. Further, our sales personnel highlytrained and are important to retaining and growing our businesses. Our success depends in large part upon our ability to identify, hire,retain and motivate highly skilled professionals. 45  We face intense competition for these professionals from our competitors,customers, marketing partners and other companies throughout the industries in which we compete. Since our inception we have successfullyrecruited and hired qualified key employees. Any failure on our part to hire, train, and retain a sufficient number of qualified professionalswould seriously damage our business. We depend heavily on the services of our senior management. We believethat our future success depends on the continued services of such management. Our business may be harmed by the loss of a significantnumber of our senior management in a short period of time. The insurance we purchase to cover our potential business riskmay be inadequate. Although we believe that our present insurance coverage is sufficientto cover our current estimated exposures, we cannot assure that we will not incur losses or liabilities in excess of our policy limits.In addition, although we believe that will be able to continue to obtain adequate coverage, we cannot assure that we will be able todo so at acceptable costs. Risks relating to our international operations Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affectour business. Since we operate as a multinational corporation that sells and sourcesproducts in many different countries, changes in exchange rates could in the future, adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations. Furthermore, reported sales and purchases made in non-U.S. currenciesby our international businesses, when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes, fluctuate due to exchange rate movement.Due to the number of currencies involved, the variability of currency exposures and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates,we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on future sales and operating results. We are subject to economic, political and other risks associatedwith our significant international business, which could adversely affect our financial results. We operate internationally primarily through wholly-owned subsidiarieslocated in North America and Europe. Revenues outside the United States were approximately 16% of total revenues in fiscal 2020. Oursales and earnings could be adversely affected by a variety of factors resulting from our international operations, including ●future fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;  ●complex regulatory requirements and changes in those    requirements;  ●trade protection measures and import or export licensing    requirements;  ●multiple jurisdictions and differing tax laws, as well    as changes in those laws;  ●restrictions on our ability to repatriate investments    and earnings from foreign operations;  ●changes in the political or economic conditions in    a country or region, including the potential impact Brexit will have on our UK operations;  ●changes in shipping costs; and  ●difficulties in collecting on accounts receivable. If any of these risks materialize, we could face substantial increasesin costs, the reduction of profit and the inability to do business. 46  With our commercialization activities outside of the United States,we are subject to the risk of inadvertently conducting activities in a manner that violates the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act andsimilar laws. If that occurs, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business,financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”),which prohibits corporations and individuals from paying, offering to pay, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreigngovernment official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or tootherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. We are also subject to the UK Anti-Bribery Act, which prohibits both domesticand international bribery, as well as bribery across both public and private sectors. In the course of establishing and expanding our commercial operationsand seeking regulatory approvals outside of the United States, we will need to establish and expand business relationships with variousthird parties and we will interact more frequently with foreign officials, including regulatory authorities. Expanded programs to maintaincompliance with such laws will be costly and may not be effective. Any interactions with any such parties or individuals where compensationis provided that are found to be in violation of such laws could result in substantial fines and penalties and could materially harmour business. Furthermore, any finding of a violation under one country’s laws may increase the likelihood that we will be prosecutedand be found to have violated another country’s laws. If our business practices outside the United States are found to be in violationof the FCPA, UK Anti-Bribery Act or other similar law, we may be subject to significant civil and criminal penalties which could havea material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Risks Relating to our Common Stock Our stock price has been volatile, which could result in substantiallosses for investors. Our common stock is quoted on the New York Stock Exchange, and therehas been historical volatility in the market price of our common stock. The trading price of our common stock has been, and is likelyto continue to be, subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors, including: ●fluctuations in our quarterly operating and earnings    per share results;  ●the gain or loss of significant contracts;  ●the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets;  ●loss of key personnel;  ●announcements of technological innovations or new products    by us or our competitors;  ●delays in the development and introduction of new products;  ●legislative or regulatory changes;  ●general trends in the industries we operate;  ●recommendations and/or changes in estimates by equity    and market research analysts;  ●biological or medical discoveries;  ●disputes and/or developments concerning intellectual    property, including patents and litigation matters;  ●public concern as to the safety of new technologies;  ●sales of common stock of existing holders;   47  ●securities class action or other litigation;  ●developments in our relationships with current or future    customers and suppliers and;  ●general economic conditions, both in the United States    and worldwide. In addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme priceand volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of our common stock, as well as the stock of many companies in our industries.Often, price fluctuations are unrelated to operating performance of the specific companies whose stock is affected. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price ofa company’s stock, securities class action litigation has occurred against the issuing company. If we were subject to this typeof litigation in the future, we could incur substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention and resources, eachof which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings. Any adverse determination in this type of litigation couldalso subject us to significant liabilities. Because we do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock,an investor in our common stock will benefit only if it appreciates in value. We currently intend to retain our retained earnings and future earnings,if any, to finance the expansion of our business and do not expect to pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.As a result, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon any future appreciation. There is no guaranteethat our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which investors purchased their shares. It may be difficult for a third party to acquire us, which couldinhibit stockholders from realizing a premium on their stock price. We are subject to the New York anti-takeover laws regulating corporatetakeovers. These anti-takeover laws prohibit certain business combinations between a New York corporation and any “interested shareholder”(generally, the beneficial owner of 20% or more of the corporation’s voting shares) for five years following the time that theshareholder became an interested shareholder, unless the corporation’s board of directors approved the transaction prior to theinterested shareholder becoming interested. Our certificate of incorporation, as amended, and by-laws containprovisions that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us that stockholders may consider favorableor beneficial. These provisions could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and takeother corporate actions. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for sharesof our common stock. These provisions include: ●a staggered board of directors, so that it would take    three successive annual meetings to replace all directors; and  ●advance notice requirements for the submission by stockholders    of nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting. Future sales of shares of our common stock or the issuance of securitiessenior to our common stock could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our ability to raise funds in new equityofferings. We are not restricted from issuing additional common stock, preferredstock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock. Future sales of a substantial number of our shares of common stockor equity-related securities in the public market or privately, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adversely affectprevailing trading prices of our common stock, and could impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity-relatedsecurities. No prediction can be made as to the effect, if any, that future sales of shares of common stock or the availability of sharesof common stock for future sale will have on the trading price of our common stock. 48  Our failure to establish and maintain effective internal controlsover financial reporting and information technology access could result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements,our failure to meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which inturn could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rulespromulgated by the SEC, companies are required to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of their internal control over financial reporting.As part of this process, we are required to document and test our internal control over financial reporting; management is required toassess and issue a report concerning our internal control over financial reporting; and our independent registered public accountingfirm may be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financialreporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, thecircumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditionsor deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective controlsystem, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be prevented or detected timely. Even effective internal controls overfinancial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. The existence of a material weakness could result in errors in ourfinancial statements that could result in a restatement of financial statements, which could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations,lead to a loss of investor confidence and have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock. "
12,ENZ,ENZO BIOCHEM INC,2019-10-15,"Risk Factors
 Business Risks Our operating results may vary from period to period. Our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarterand from year to year, depending on a variety of factors including:  ·competition from larger commercial clinical laboratories, hospital affiliated laboratories, and physician office laboratories; ·health care reform regulations affecting providers and plan sponsors, including those stemming from the Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA) or its repeal, amendment or replacement; ·changes in reimbursement policies by third party and government payers, especially those stemming from The Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (“PAMA”); ·customer demand for our products due to changes in purchasing requirements and research needs; ·the introduction of new products by us or our competitors; ·the timing of our research and development, sales and marketing expenses; ·general worldwide economic conditions affecting funding of research; ·seasonal fluctuations in revenues due to the impact of weather and holiday periods ·expenses associated with defending our intellectual property portfolio ·foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; ·changes in tax laws, the results of tax audits or the measurement of tax uncertainties; and ·the success of identifying, acquiring and integrating businesses that complement our product offerings, add new technology or add presence in a market; Consequently, results for any interim or full year period may notnecessarily be indicative of results in subsequent periods.24A significant proportion of our Products revenues are from academiccenters, funded by government grants in our major markets globally. Governments around the world have been reviewing long term publicfunding of life science research in response to the problems arising from global financial pressures. As a result, the availablefunds for discretionary purchases from market to market have been capped or reduced based on available National budgets. Reducedgrants for researchers could impact our business, in the amount, price and type of products bought and used by customers. A significant proportion of our Products revenues are from customersin pharmaceutical and biotech companies. Globally, pharmaceutical companies are challenging internal budgets,and the return of investment from their R&D spend. This could impact our business, in the amount, price and type of productsbought and used by customers. Our future success will depend in part upon our ability to enhanceexisting products, develop and introduce new products and realize commercial acceptance of those products, in a rapidly changingtechnological environment. The market for our products is characterized by rapidly changingtechnology, evolving industry standards and new product introductions, which may make our existing products obsolete. Our futuresuccess will depend in part upon our ability to enhance existing products, develop and introduce new products, and realize commercialacceptance of those products. The development of new or enhanced products is a complex and uncertainprocess requiring the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends as well as precise technological execution. In addition,the successful development of new products will depend on the development of new technologies. We will be required to undertaketime-consuming and costly development activities and to seek regulatory approval for these new products. We may experience difficultiesthat could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of these new products. Regulatory clearanceor approval of any new products may not be granted by the FDA, state-wide agency or foreign regulatory authorities on a timelybasis, or at all, and the new products may not be successfully commercialized. We may be unable to identify, acquire and integrate acquisitiontargets. Our strategy envisions, if an opportunistic target is identified,future growth from acquiring and integrating similar operations and/or product or services lines. There can be no assurance thatwe will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates and, once identified, to negotiate successfully their acquisition ata price or on terms and conditions favorable to us, or to integrate the operations of such acquired businesses with the existingoperations. In addition, we compete for acquisition candidates with other entities, some of which have greater financial resourcesthan ours. Failure to implement successfully our acquisition strategy would limit our potential growth. Our inability to carry out certain of our marketing and salesplans may make it difficult for us to grow or maintain our business. The Life Sciences product segment continues a marketing programdesigned to more directly service its end users, while simultaneously promoting the Enzo Life Science brand, with reference toour acquired brands. We will continue to reach out to our customers using our direct field sales force, in-house business team,the on-going enhancement of our interactive websites, continued attendance at top industry trade meetings, and publications tocustomers and in leading scientific journals. In addition to our direct sales, we operate worldwide through wholly-owned subsidiaries(in USA, Switzerland, Belgium, Germany, and the UK), a branch office in France and a network of third-party distributors in mostother significant markets. If we are unable to successfully continue these programs, we may be unable to grow and our businesscould suffer. We face significant competition, which could cause us to decreasethe prices for our products or services or render our products uneconomical or obsolete, any of which could reduce our revenuesand limit our growth. Our competitors in the biotechnology industry in the United Statesand abroad are numerous and include major pharmaceutical, energy, food and chemical companies, as well as specialized genetic engineeringfirms. Many of our large competitors have substantially greater resources than us and have the capability of developing productswhich compete directly with our products. Many of these companies are performing research in the same areas as we are. The marketsfor our products are also subject to competitive risks because markets are highly price competitive. Our competitors have competedin the past by lowering prices on certain products. The clinical laboratory services business is highly fragmented andintensely competitive, and we compete with numerous national and local companies. Some of these entities are larger than we areand have greater resources than we do. We compete primarily on the basis of the quality of our testing, reporting and informationservices, our reputation in the medical community, the pricing of our services and our ability to employ qualified professionals.25These competitive conditions could, among other things: •require us to reduce our prices to retain market share;•require us to increase our marketing efforts which could reduce our profit margins;•increase our cost of labor to attract qualified personnel;•render our biotechnology products uneconomical or obsolete or;•reduce our revenue Ethical, legal and social concerns surrounding the use of geneticinformation could reduce demand for our products. Genetic testing has raised ethical issues regarding privacy andthe appropriate uses of the resulting information. For these reasons, governmental authorities may call for limits on or regulationof the use of genetic testing or prohibit testing for genetic predisposition to certain conditions, particularly for those thathave no known cure. Similarly, such concerns may lead individuals to refuse to use genetics tests even if permissible. Any of thesescenarios could reduce the potential markets for our molecular diagnostic products, which could have a material adverse effecton our business, financial condition and results of operations. We depend on distributors and contract manufacturers and suppliersfor materials that could impair our ability to manufacture or distribute our products. We manufacture and distribute our own brand products and the productsof third party manufacturers and suppliers. Distributors also sell our branded products. To the extent we are unable to maintainor replace a distributor in a reasonable time period, or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, our operations could be disrupted. Outside distributors, suppliers and contract manufacturers providekey finished goods, components and raw materials used in the sale and manufacture of our products. Although we believe that alternativesources for components and raw materials are available, any supply interruption in a limited or sole source component or raw materialwould harm our ability to manufacture our products until a new source of supply is identified and qualified. In addition, an uncorrecteddefect or supplier’s variation in a component or raw material, either unknown to us or incompatible with our manufacturingprocess, could harm our ability to manufacture products. We might not be able to find a sufficient alternative supplier in a reasonabletime period, or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we fail to obtain a supplier for the components of our products,our operations could be disrupted. We use hazardous materials in our business. Any claims relatingto improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials could be costly and time-consuming. Our manufacturing, clinical laboratory and research and developmentprocesses involve the storage, use and disposal of hazardous substances, including hazardous chemicals, biological hazardous materialsand radioactive compounds. We are subject to governmental regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposalof materials and waste products. Although we believe that our safety and environmental management practices and procedures forhandling and disposing of these hazardous materials are in accordance with good industry practice and comply with applicable laws,permits, licenses and regulations, the risk of accidental environmental or human contamination or injury from the release or exposureof hazardous materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for any damages thatresult, including environmental clean-up or decontamination costs, and any such liability could exceed the limits of, or fall outsidethe coverage of, our insurance. We may not be able to maintain insurance on acceptable terms, orat all. We could be required to incur significant costs to comply with current or future environmental and public and workplacesafety and health laws and regulations. We are required to expend significant resources for researchand development for our products in development and these products may not be developed successfully. Failure to successfully developthese products may prevent us from earning a return on our research and development expenditures. The products we are developing are at various stages of developmentand clinical evaluations and may require further technical development and investment to determine whether commercial applicationis practicable. There can be no assurance that our efforts will result in products with valuable commercial applications. Our cashrequirements may vary materially from current estimates because of results of our research and development programs, competitiveand technological advances and other factors. In any event, we will require substantial funds to conduct development activitiesand pre-clinical and clinical trials, apply for regulatory approvals and commercialize products, if any, that are developed. We do not have any commitments or arrangements to obtain any additionalfinancing and there is no assurance that required financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. Even if wespend substantial amounts on research and development, our potential products may not be developed successfully.26If our product candidates on which we have expended significant amounts for research and development are not commercialized, wewill not earn a return on our research and development expenditures, which may harm our business.We rely on network and information systems and othertechnology whose failure or misuse could cause a disruption of services or loss or improper disclosure of personal data, businessinformation, including intellectual property, or other confidential information, resulting in increased costs, loss of revenueor other harm to our business.  Network and information systems and other technologies, includingthose related to the Company’s network management, are important to its business activities. The Company also relies on thirdparty providers for certain technology and “cloud-based” systems and services that support a variety of business operations.Network and information systems-related events affecting the Company’s systems, or those of third parties upon which theCompany’s business relies, such as computer compromises, cyber threats and attacks, computer viruses, worms or other destructiveor disruptive software, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious activities,or any combination of the foregoing, as well as power outages, equipment failure, natural disasters (including extreme weather),terrorist activities, war, human or technological error or malfeasance that may affect such systems, could result in disruptionof the Company’s business and/or loss, corruption or improper disclosure of personal data, business information, includingintellectual property, or other confidential information. In addition, any design or manufacturing defects in, or the improperimplementation of, hardware or software applications the Company develops or procures from third parties could unexpectedly compromiseinformation security. In recent years, there has been a rise in the number of cyber-attacks on companies’ network and informationsystems, and such attacks have become more sophisticated, targeted and difficult to detect and prevent against. As a result, therisks associated with such an event continue to increase, particularly as the Company’s digital businesses expand. Whilethe Company has developed and implemented security measures and internal controls that are designed to protect personal data, businessinformation, including intellectual property, and other confidential information, to prevent data loss, and to prevent or detectsecurity breaches, such security measures cannot provide absolute security and may not be successful in preventing these eventsfrom occurring, particularly given that techniques used to access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently,and any network and information systems-related events could require the Company to expend significant resources to remedy suchevent. Moreover, the development and maintenance of these measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologieschange and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. While the Company maintains cyber risk insurance, thisinsurance may not be sufficient to cover all losses from any future breaches of our systems. A significant failure, compromise, breach or interruption of theCompany’s systems, or those of third parties upon which its business relies, could result in a disruption of its operations,customer, audience or advertiser dissatisfaction, damage to its reputation or brands, regulatory investigations and enforcementactions, lawsuits, remediation costs, a loss of customers, advertisers or revenues and other financial losses. If any such failure,interruption or similar event results in the improper disclosure of information maintained in the Company’s information systemsand networks or those of its vendors, including financial, personal, credit card, confidential and proprietary information relatingto personnel, customers, vendors and the Company’s business, including its intellectual property, the Company could alsobe subject to liability under relevant contractual obligations and laws and regulations protecting personal data and privacy. Inaddition, media or other reports of perceived security vulnerabilities to our systems or those of third parties upon which theCompany’s business relies, even if nothing has actually been attempted or occurred, could also adversely impact our brandand reputation and materially affect our business. Risks relating to our Intellectual Property and RegulatoryApproval Protecting our proprietary rights is difficult and costly. Ifwe fail to adequately protect or enforce our proprietary rights, we could lose potential revenue from licensing and royalties. Our potential revenue and success depends in large part on our abilityto obtain, maintain and enforce our patents. Our ability to commercialize any product successfully will largely depend on our abilityto obtain and maintain patents of sufficient scope to prevent third parties from developing similar or competitive products. Inthe absence of patent protection, competitors may impact our business by developing and marketing substantially equivalent productsand technology. Patent disputes are frequent and can preclude the commercializationof products. We have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be, involved in material patent litigation, such asthe matters discussed under “Part I - Item 3. Legal Proceedings” in this report. Patent protection litigation is time-consumingand we have incurred and anticipate continuing to incur significant legal costs. In addition, an adverse decision could force usto either obtain third-party licenses at a material cost or cease using the technology or product in dispute. We have filed applications for United States and foreign patentscovering certain aspects of our technology, but there is no assurance that pending patents will issue or as to the degree of protectionwhich any issued patent might afford.27Lawsuits, including patent infringements, in the biotechnology industry are not uncommon. If we become involved in any significantlitigation, we would suffer as a result of the diversion of our management’s attention, the expense of litigation and anyjudgments against us. In addition to intellectual property litigation for infringement,other substantial, complex or extended litigation could result in large expenditures by us and distraction of our management. Patentlitigation is time-consuming and costly in its own right and could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties. In addition,an adverse decision could force us to either obtain third-party licenses at a material cost or cease using the technology or productin dispute. In addition, lawsuits by employees, stockholders, collaborators or distributors could be very costly and substantiallydisrupt our business. Disputes from time to time with companies or individuals are not uncommon in the biotechnology industry,and we cannot assure you that we will always be able to resolve them out of court. We also utilize certain unpatented proprietary technology and noassurance can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary technology, that such proprietarytechnology will not be disclosed or that we can meaningfully protect our rights to such proprietary technology. Our businessis subject to governmental laws and regulations. Changes in the way the FDA regulates the reagents, and other consumableswe use when developing, validating, and performing our tests could result in delay or additional expense in bringing our teststo market or performing such tests for our customers. We may be unable to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals for ourproducts, which could reduce our revenue or prevent us from earning a return on our research and development expenditures. Our research, preclinical development, clinical trials, productmanufacturing and marketing are subject to regulation by the FDA and similar health authorities in foreign countries. The FDA hasregulatory responsibility over, among other areas, instruments, software, test kits, reagents and other devices used by clinicallaboratories to perform diagnostic testing in the U.S. The tests we develop internally are offered as lab developed tests or LDTs.The FDA has claimed regulatory authority over all LDTs, but has stated that it exercised enforcement discretion with regard tomost LDTs performed by high complexity CLIA-certified laboratories. As the FDA moves to regulate more clinical laboratory testing,its approach to regulation is impacting industry practices and participants, new competitors may enter the industry, and competitionmay come in new forms. In late 2018, legislation was introduced in Congress that would enable the FDA to regulate LDTs, in vitrodiagnostics, software and other items used in the diagnosis of disease. If this legislation were to become law, the FDA could regulatediagnostic tests and components and platforms used as part of these tests. If such legislation were to become law, it could havea significant impact on the clinical laboratory testing industry, including regulating LDTs in new ways and creating avenues ofopportunity and competition regarding clinical laboratory testing. New competitors may enter the industry, and competition maycome in new forms. Pursuant to the 21st Century Cures Act, the FDA issued guidance regarding its position on the regulation ofclinical decision software, which may be used in, or in connection with, LDTs. The guidance attempts to clarify whether FDA approvalof certain software is required. In January 2019 the FDA issued draft guidance on a pre-certification pilot program to help softwaredevelopers have a speedier and less restrictive path to clearance or approval of their software. We cannot be sure that we can obtain necessary regulatory approvalson a timely basis, if at all, for any of the products we are developing or manufacturing or that we can maintain necessary regulatoryapprovals for our existing products, and all of the following could have a material adverse effect on our business: •significant delays in obtaining or failing to obtain required approvals;•loss of, or changes to, previously obtained approvals;•failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements and;•changes to manufacturing processes, manufacturing process standards or Good Manufacturing Practices following approval or changing interpretations of these factors. Adverse perception and increased regulatory scrutiny of genemedicine and genetic research might limit our ability to conduct our business. Ethical, social and legal concerns about gene medicine, genetictesting and genetic research could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting the technologies we or our collaboratorsmay use. Recently, gene medicine studies have come under increasing scrutiny, which has delayed on-going and could delay futureclinical trials and regulatory approvals. Federal and state agencies, congressional committees and foreign governments have expressedinterest in further regulating biotechnology. More restrictive regulations or claims that our products are unsafe or pose a hazardcould prevent us from commercializing any products.28Financial Risks With the exception of fiscal years 2019 and 2016, we have experiencedsignificant losses in our previous five fiscal years and quarter to quarter over such periods and our losses have resulted in theuse of cash in operations. If such losses and cash uses continue, the value of your investment could decline significantly. Although for fiscal year 2019, we reported net income of $2.2 million,we incurred net losses of $10.3 million and $2.5 million for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2018 and 2017 respectively. If ourrevenues do not increase, or if our operating expenses exceed expectations or cannot be reduced, we will continue to suffer substantiallosses and use cash in operations which could have an adverse effect on our business and adversely affect your investment in ourCompany. We may need additional capital to fund growth, which may notbe available on acceptable terms or at all, and could result in our business plan being limited and our business being harmed. Our ability to increase revenue and improve profitability and liquiditywill depend in part on our ability to grow our products business with higher margin products and increase our market share andcontinue to grow the Laboratory Services business with new tests with higher reimbursements and increase our service volume whichmay require significant additional capital that may not be available to us. We may need additional financing due to future developments,changes in our business plan or failure of our current business plan to succeed, which could result from increased marketing, distributionor research and development costs. Our actual funding requirements could vary materially from our current estimates. If additionalfinancing is needed, we may not be able to raise sufficient funds on favourable terms or at all. If we issue common stock or securitiesconvertible into common stock in the future, such issuance will result in the then-existing stockholders sustaining dilution totheir relative proportion of our outstanding equity. If we fail to obtain any necessary financing on a timely basis, then our abilityto execute our current business plan may be limited, and our business, liquidity and financial condition could be harmed. Our use of leverage may expose us to substantial risks As of July 31, 2019, we had $4.4 million in borrowings under a tenyear mortgage agreement with Citibank, N.A., which bears a fixed interest rate of 5.09% per annum. We may incur additional indebtednessin the future. Additionally, the adoption of the new lease accounting standard at the start of fiscal 2020 will result in the recognitionof right of use assets and liabilities of approximately $25 million. Accordingly, we are exposed to the typical risks associatedwith the use of leverage. Increased leverage makes it more difficult for us to withstand adverse economic conditions or businessplan variances, to take advantage of new business opportunities, or to make necessary capital expenditures. Themortgage agreement includes customary affirmative and negative covenants and events of default, as defined. Events of default includenon-payment of principal and interest on debt outstanding, non-performance of covenants, material changes in business, breach ofrepresentations, bankruptcy or insolvency, and changes in control. Our ability to maintain our compliance with these covenantsis dependent on our financial performance, which is influenced by a number of factors. Violation of any of these covenants wouldresult in an event of default under the mortgage agreement. Upon the occurrence of an event of default that is not cured or waived,the lender would have the ability to accelerate the repayment of all amounts then outstanding under the mortgage agreement. We may incur impairment charges on our goodwill and intangibleswhich would reduce our earnings. We are subject to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ASC350, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (“ASC 350”) which requires that goodwill and other intangible assets thathave an indefinite life be tested at least annually for impairment. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite livesmust also be tested for impairment between the annual tests if a triggering event occurs that would likely reduce the fair valueof the asset below its carrying amount. Intangible assets with finite lives are assessed for impairment when, and if, an indicatorof potential impairment is identified. As of July 31, 2019 and 2018, goodwill and intangible assets representedapproximately 8% and 9%, respectively, of our total assets. If we determine that there has been impairment, our financial resultsfor the relevant period would be reduced by the amount of the impairment, net of tax effects, if any. The Company has no intangibleassets with indefinite lives. Risks relating to our Clinical Laboratory Services segment The clinical testing business is highly competitive, and if wefail to provide an appropriately priced level of service or otherwise fail to compete effectively it could have a material adverseeffect on our revenues and profitability. The clinical testing business is a fragmented and highly competitiveindustry. We primarily compete with three types of clinical testing providers: other commercial clinical laboratories, hospital-affiliatedlaboratories and physician-office laboratories. We also compete with other providers, including anatomic pathology practices andlarge physician group practices. Hospitals generally29maintain on-site laboratories to perform testing on their patients(inpatient or outpatient). In addition, many hospitals compete with commercial clinical laboratories for outreach (non-hospitalpatients) testing. Hospitals may seek to leverage their relationships with community clinicians and encourage the clinicians tosend their outreach testing to the hospital’s laboratory. As a result of this affiliation between hospitals and community clinicians,we compete against hospital-affiliated laboratories primarily based on quality and scope of service as well as pricing. In addition,hospitals that own physician practices may require the practices to refer testing to the hospital’s laboratory. In recent years,there has been a trend of hospitals acquiring physician practices, increasing the percentage of physician practices owned by hospitals.Increased hospital ownership of physician practices may enhance clinician ties to hospital-affiliated laboratories and may strengthentheir competitive position. The diagnostic information services industry also is faced with changing technology and new productintroductions. Competitors may compete using advanced technology, including technology that enables more convenient or cost-effectivetesting. Competitors also may compete on the basis of new service offerings. Competitors also may offer testing to be performedoutside of a commercial clinical laboratory, such as (1) point-of-care testing that can be performed by physicians in their offices;(2) advanced testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories; and (3) home testing that can be carried outwithout requiring the services of outside providers. Our clinical laboratory services business is subject to extensivegovernment regulation and our loss of any required certifications or licenses could require us to cease operating this part ofour business, which would reduce our revenue and injure our reputation. The clinical laboratory industryis subject to significant governmental regulation at the Federal, state and local levels. Under the Clinical Laboratory ImprovementAct of 1967 and the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (collectively, as amended, “CLIA”) virtuallyall clinical laboratories, including ours, must be certified by the Federal government. Many clinical laboratories also must meetother governmental standards, undergo proficiency testing and are subject to inspection. Certifications or licenses are also requiredby various state and local laws. The failure of our clinical laboratory to obtain or maintain such certifications or licenses underthese laws could interrupt our ability to operate our clinical laboratory business and injure our reputation.  Reimbursements from third-party payers including managed careorganizations and Medicare, upon which our clinical laboratory business is dependent, are subject to varying rates and coverageand legislative reform that are beyond our control. Any reforms that decrease coverage and rates could reduce our earnings andharm our business. Our clinical laboratory services business is primarily dependentupon reimbursement from third-party payers, such as Medicaid, Medicare (which principally serves patients 65 and older) and commercialinsurers. We are subject to variances in reimbursement rates among different third-party payers, as well as constant renegotiationof those reimbursement rates. Government and non-government payers have in the past sought, and continueto seek, to reduce and limit utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services, including the areas of clinical and genetictesting. We also are subject to audit by Medicare and the commercial insurers, which can result in the return of paymentsmade to us under these programs. These variances in reimbursement rates and audit results could reduce our margins and thus ourearnings. The health care industry continues to undergo significant changeas third-party payers’ increase their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of health care services. In aneffort to address the problem of increasing health care costs, legislation has been proposed or enacted at both the Federal andstate levels to regulate health care delivery in general and clinical laboratories in particular. Some of the proposals includemanaged competition, global budgeting and price controls. Changes that decrease reimbursement rates or coverage, or increase administrativeburdens on billing third-party payers could reduce our revenues and increase our expenses.Since each payer makes its own decision as to whetherto establish a policy or enter into a contract to cover our tests, as well as the amount it will reimburse for a test, seekingthese approvals is a time-consuming and costly process. In addition, the determination by a payer to cover and the amount it willreimburse for our tests will likely be made on an indication by indication basis. To date, we have obtained policy-level reimbursementapproval or contractual reimbursement for some indications for our test from a small number of commercial third-party payers, andhave not obtained coverage from Medicare or any state Medicaid program. Further, we believe that establishing adequate reimbursementfrom Medicare is an important factor in gaining adoption from healthcare providers. Our claims for reimbursement from commercialpayers may be denied upon submission, and we must appeal the claims. The appeals process is time consuming and expensive, and maynot result in payment. In cases where there is not a contracted rate for reimbursement, there is typically a greater co-insuranceor co-payment requirement from the patient which may result in further delay or decreased likelihood of collection.We expect to continue to focus substantial resources onincreasing adoption of, and coverage and reimbursement for, our current tests and any future tests we may develop. We believe itmay take several years to achieve coverage and adequate contracted reimbursement with a majority of third-party payers. However,we cannot predict whether, under what circumstances, or at what payment levels payers will reimburse for our tests. If we failto establish and maintain broad adoption of, and coverage and reimbursement for, our tests, our ability to generate revenue couldbe harmed and our future prospects and our business could suffer.30Government payers, such as Medicare and Medicaid, have takensteps to reduce the utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services, including clinical testing services. U.S. healthcarereform legislation may result in significant change and our business could be adversely impacted if we fail to adapt. We face efforts by government payers to reduce utilizationof and reimbursement for diagnostic information services. We expect efforts to reduce reimbursements, to impose more stringentcost controls and to reduce utilization of clinical test services will continue. Pursuant to The Protecting Access to MedicareAct of 2014 (PAMA), which was implemented in 2018, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) promulgated revised reimbursementrate schedules for the years 2018 through 2020 for clinical laboratory testing services provided under Medicare. Reimbursementrates for clinical laboratory testing were reduced in 2018 and 2019 and are scheduled to be reduced again by approximately 10%in 2020. PAMA calls for further revision of the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule for years after 2020, based on futuresurveys of market rates; reimbursement rate reduction from 2021-23 is capped by PAMA at 15% annually. Private health plans and other third parties have taken stepsto reduce the utilization and reimbursement of health services, including clinical testing services.We face efforts by non-governmental third-party payers,including health plans, to reduce utilization of and reimbursement for clinical testing services. Examples include increased useof prior authorization requirements and increased denial of coverage for services. Since the passage of ACA, there is increasedmarket activity regarding alternative payment models, including bundled payment models. We expect continuing efforts by third-partypayers, including in their rules, practices and policies, to reduce reimbursements, to impose more stringent cost controls andto reduce utilization of clinical testing services. The healthcare industry has experienced a trend of consolidation among healthinsurance plans, resulting in fewer but larger insurance plans with significant bargaining power to negotiate fee arrangementswith healthcare providers, including clinical testing providers. These health plans, and independent physician associations, maydemand that clinical testing providers accept discounted fee structures or assume all or a portion of the financial risk associatedwith providing testing services to their members through capitated payment arrangements. Some health plans also are reviewing testcoding, evaluating coverage decisions and requiring preauthorization of certain testing. There are also an increasing number ofpatients enrolling in consumer driven products and high deductible plans that involve greater patient cost-sharing. The increasedconsolidation among health plans also has increased pricing transparency and bargaining power and the potential adverse impactof ceasing to be a contracted provider with any such insurer. Changes in provider mix, including continued growth in capitatedmanaged-cost health care and changes in certain third party provider agreements could have a material adverse impact on the Company’snet revenues and profitability. Certain third party provider companies have adopted national andregional programs which include multiple managed-care reimbursement models. If the Company is unable to participate in these programsor if the Company would lose a material contract, it could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s net revenues andprofitability. The number of individuals covered under managed care contracts orother similar arrangements has grown over the past several years and may continue to grow in the future. In addition, Medicareand other government healthcare programs may continue to shift to managed care. Entities providing managed care coverage have reducedpayments for medical services, including clinical laboratory services, in numerous ways such as entering into arrangements underwhich payments to a service provider are capitated, limiting testing to specified procedures, denying payment for services performedwithout prior authorization and refusing to increase fees for specified services. These trends reduce our revenues and limit ourability to pass cost increases to our customers. Also, if these or other managed care organizations do not select us as a participatingprovider, we may lose some or all of that business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition andresults of operations. Because of competitive pressures, impacts of the economy on patientvisits to our customer physician locations and the complexity and expense of the billing process in our clinical laboratory servicesbusiness, we must obtain new customers while maintaining existing customers to grow our business. Intense competition in the clinical laboratory business, increasingadministrative burdens upon the reimbursement process, reduced patient traffic, and reduced coverage and payments by insurers makeit necessary for us to increase our volume of laboratory services. To do so, we must obtain new customers while retaining existingcustomers. Our failure to attract new customers or the loss of existing customers or a reduction in business from those customerscould significantly reduce our revenues and impede our ability to grow. Compliance with Medicare administrative policies, including thosepertaining to certain automated blood chemistry profiles, may reduce the reimbursements we receive.31Containment of health care costs, including reimbursement for clinicallaboratory services, has been a focus of on-going governmental activity. Clinical laboratories must bill Medicare directly forthe services provided to Medicare beneficiaries and may only collect the amounts permitted under this fee schedule. Reimbursementto clinical laboratories under the Medicare Fee Schedule has been steadily declining since its inception. Because a significantportion of our costs is fixed, these Medicare reimbursement reductions and changes have a direct adverse effect on our operatingresults and cash flows. The development of new, more cost-effective tests that can beperformed by our customers or by patients, and the continued internalization of testing by hospitals or physicians, could negativelyimpact our testing volume and revenues. The diagnostic industry is faced with changing technology and newproduct introductions, including technology that enables more convenient or cost-effective testing. Some of our competitors alsomay offer testing to be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory, such as point-of-care testing that can be performedby physicians in their offices; complex testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories; and home testingthat can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers. Advances in technology also may lead to the need for less frequenttesting. Further, diagnostic tests approved or cleared by the FDA for home use are automatically deemed to be “waived”tests under CLIA and may be performed by patients in their homes; test kit manufacturers could seek to increase sales to patientsof such test kits. Development of such technology and its use by our customers would reduce the demand for our laboratory-basedtesting services and negatively impact our revenues. Our business could be harmed from the loss or suspension of alicense or imposition of a fine or penalties under, or future changes in, or changing interpretations of, CLIA or state laboratorylicensing laws to which we are subject. The clinical laboratory testing industry is subject to extensivefederal and state regulation, and many of these statutes and regulations have not been interpreted by the courts. The CLIA amendmentsare federal regulatory standards that apply to virtually all clinical laboratories (regardless of the location, size or type oflaboratory), including those operated by physicians in their offices, by requiring that they be certified by the federal governmentor by a federally approved accreditation agency. CLIA does not pre-empt state law, which in some cases may be more stringent thanfederal law and require additional personnel qualifications, quality control, record maintenance and proficiency testing. The sanctionfor failure to comply with CLIA and state requirements may be suspension, revocation or limitation of a laboratory’s CLIAcertificate, which is necessary to conduct business, as well as significant fines and/or criminal penalties. Several states havesimilar laws and we may be subject to similar penalties. We cannot assure that applicable statutes and regulations will notbe interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely affect our business.Potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include significant fines and the suspension or loss of variouslicenses, certificates and authorizations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, compliancewith future legislation could impose additional requirements on us, which may be costly. Our business operations and reputation maybe materially impaired if we do not comply with privacy laws or information security policies. In our business, we collect, generate, processor maintain sensitive information, such as patient data and other personal information. If we do use or not adequately safeguardthat information in compliance with applicable requirements under federal, state and international laws, or if it were disclosedto persons or entities that should not have access to it, our business could be materially impaired, our reputation could sufferand we could be subject to fines, penalties and litigation. In the event of a data security breach, we may be subject to notificationobligations, litigation and governmental investigation or sanctions, and may suffer reputational damage, which could have an adverseimpact on our business. We are subject to laws and regulations regarding protecting the security and privacy of certain healthcareand personal information, including: (a) the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) and the regulationsthereunder, which establish (i) a complex regulatory framework including requirements for safeguarding protected health informationand (ii) comprehensive federal standards regarding the uses and disclosures of protected health information; (b) state laws; and(c) the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation.  FDA regulation of laboratory-developed tests, analyte specificreagents, or genetic testing could lead to increased costs and delays in introducing new genetic tests. The FDA has regulatory responsibility over, among other areas, instruments,test kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories to perform diagnostic testing in the U.S. A number of testswe develop internally are offered as lab developed tests (LDTs). The FDA has claimed regulatory authority over all LDTs, but hasstated that it exercised enforcement discretion with regard to most LDTs performed by high complexity CLIA-certified laboratories.The FDA has published a “Discussion Document” that provides the FDA’s views on legislation to govern LDTs. New legislationcould significantly impact the clinical laboratory testing32business, including by increasing or modifying the regulation ofLDTs, hindering our ability to develop and market new services, causing an increase in the cost of our services, delaying our abilityto introduce new tests or hindering our ability to perform testing. We are subject to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuseand other laws and regulations and could face substantial penalties if we are unable to fully comply with such laws. As a provider of clinical laboratory testing services, we are subjectto extensive and frequently changing federal, state and local laws and regulations governing various aspects of our business. Forexample, we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by both the federal government and the statesin which we conduct our business. These healthcare laws and regulations include, for example: §federal anti-kickback laws, which constrain our marketing practices,educational programs, pricing policies, and relationships with healthcare providers or other entities, including third-party laboratories,by prohibiting, among other things, persons or entities from soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directlyor indirectly, in return for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease order or recommendationof, any good, facility, item or services for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare programsuch as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;   §federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penaltylaws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claimsfor payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent, and which may apply to entities likeus to the extent that our interactions with customers may affect their billing or coding practices;   §HIPAA, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy,security and transmission of individually identifiable health information, and also established federal crimes for knowingly andwillfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements in connection with the deliveryof or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services, and which imposed certain requirements relating to privacy, security,and transmission of individually identifiable health information;   §the federal physician self-referral law, commonly known as the StarkLaw, which prohibits a physician from making a referral to an entity for certain designated health services reimbursed by Medicareor Medicaid if the physician (or a member of the physician’s family) has a financial relationship with the entity, and whichalso prohibits the submission of any claims for reimbursement for designated health services furnished pursuant to a prohibitedreferral;   §the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, and its implementing regulations,which requires manufacturers of certain drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare,Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the United States Departmentof Health and Human Services information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to includedoctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interestsheld by physicians and their immediate family members;   §federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadlyregulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers; and   §state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickbackand false claims laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurersand state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from eachother in significant ways, with differing effects. We are unable to predict what additional federal or state legislationor regulatory initiatives may be enacted in the future regarding our business or the healthcare industry in general, or what effectsuch legislation or regulations may have on us. Federal or state governments may impose additional restrictions or adopt interpretationsof existing laws that could have an adverse effect on us. We incur significant costs in complying with these laws and regulations.Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that someof our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations, or our sales techniquesor product placement strategies, are found to be in violation of, or to encourage or assist the violation by third parties of,any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, or if we fail to maintain, renew or obtainnecessary permits, licenses and approvals related to our in-house laboratory, we may be subject to penalties, including civil andcriminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputationalharm, diminished profits and future earnings, suspension or revocation of certifications or licenses that are required to operateour business, injunctions and other associated remedies, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, denial or withdrawalof product clearances, or private “qui tam” actions brought by individual33whistleblowers in the name of the government, any of which couldhave an adverse effect on our business. If we or others determine that any of our existing customer relationships do not complywith applicable laws and regulations, either due to changes in such laws and regulations or evolving interpretations of such lawsand regulations, we may be required to renegotiate or terminate such relationships. Any penalties, damages, fines, exclusions,curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.The risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of these laws are broad and their provisionsare open to a variety of interpretations. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend againstit, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. Other risks relating to our business If we fail to maintain or monitor our information systems ourbusinesses could be adversely affected. We depend on information systems throughout our Company to controlour manufacturing, inventory, distribution and website and the clinical laboratory services processes for: processing specimens,managing inventory, processing test results and submitting claims, collecting from insurers and patients, responding to inquiries,contributing to our overall internal control processes, maintaining records of our property, plant and equipment, and recordingand paying amounts due vendors and other creditors. If we were to experience a prolonged disruption in our information systemsthat involve interactions with customers and suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and/or increased costs,which could adversely affect our business. Cyber security risks and the failure tomaintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our computer hardware, software, and Internet applications and relatedtools and functions could result in damage to the Company’s reputation and/or subject the Company to costs, fines, or lawsuits. The integrity and protection of our owndata, and that of its customers and employees, is critical to the Company’s business. The regulatory environment governinginformation, security and privacy laws is increasingly demanding and continues to evolve. Maintaining compliance with applicablesecurity and privacy regulations may increase the Company’s operating costs and/or adversely impact the Company’s abilityto market its products and services to customers. Although the Company’s computer and communications hardware is protectedthrough physical and software safeguards, it is still vulnerable to fire, storm, flood, power loss, earthquakes, telecommunicationsfailures, physical or software break-ins, software viruses, and similar events. These events could lead to the unauthorized access,disclosure and use of non-public information. The techniques used by criminal elements to attack computer systems are sophisticated,change frequently and may originate from less regulated and remote areas of the world. As a result, the Company may not be ableto address these techniques proactively or implement adequate preventative measures. If the Company’s computer systems arecompromised, it could be subject to fines, damages, litigation, and enforcement actions, customers could curtail or cease usingits applications, and the Company could lose trade secrets, the occurrence of which could harm its business. If we fail to attract and retain key personnel, including oursenior management, our business could be adversely affected. Most of our products and services are highly technical in nature.In general, only highly qualified and trained scientists and technician personnel have the necessary skills to develop proprietarytechnological products and market our products, support our research and development programs and provide our clinical laboratoryservices. In addition, some of our manufacturing, quality control, safetyand compliance, information technology and e-commerce related positions are highly technical as well. Further, our sales personnelhighly trained and are important to retaining and growing our businesses. Our success depends in large part upon our ability toidentify, hire, retain and motivate highly skilled professionals. We face intense competition for these professionals from our competitors,customers, marketing partners and other companies throughout the industries in which we compete. Since our inception we have successfullyrecruited and hired qualified key employees. Any failure on our part to hire, train, and retain a sufficient number of qualifiedprofessionals would seriously damage our business. We depend heavily on the services of our senior management. We believethat our future success depends on the continued services of such management. Our business may be harmed by the loss of a significantnumber of our senior management in a short period of time. The insurance we purchase to cover our potential business riskmay be inadequate. Although we believe that our present insurance coverage is sufficientto cover our current estimated exposures, we cannot assure that we will not incur losses or liabilities in excess of our policylimits. In addition, although we believe that will be able to continue to obtain adequate coverage, we cannot assure that we willbe able to do so at acceptable costs.34Risks relating to our international operations Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affectour business. Since we operate as a multinational corporation that sells and sourcesproducts in many different countries, changes in exchange rates could in the future, adversely affect our cash flows and resultsof operations. Furthermore, reported sales and purchases made in non-U.S. currenciesby our international businesses, when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes, fluctuate due to exchangerate movement. Due to the number of currencies involved, the variability of currency exposures and the potential volatility ofcurrency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on future sales and operating results. We are subject to economic, political and other risks associatedwith our significant international business, which could adversely affect our financial results. We operate internationally primarily through wholly-owned subsidiarieslocated in North America and Europe. Revenues outside the United States were approximately 11% of total revenues in fiscal 2019.Our sales and earnings could be adversely affected by a variety of factors resulting from our international operations, including •future fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;•complex regulatory requirements and changes in those requirements;•trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;•multiple jurisdictions and differing tax laws, as well as changes in those laws;•restrictions on our ability to repatriate investments and earnings from foreign operations;•changes in the political or economic conditions in a country or region, including the potential impact Brexit will have on our UK operations;•changes in shipping costs; and•difficulties in collecting on accounts receivable. If any of these risks materialize, we could face substantial increasesin costs, the reduction of profit and the inability to do business. With our commercialization activities outside of the United States,we are subject to the risk of inadvertently conducting activities in a manner that violates the U.S. Foreign Corrupt PracticesAct and similar laws. If that occurs, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties which could have a material adverse effecton our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”),which prohibits corporations and individuals from paying, offering to pay, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to anyforeign government official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retainbusiness or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. We are also subject to the UK Anti-Bribery Act, whichprohibits both domestic and international bribery, as well as bribery across both public and private sectors. In the course of establishing and expanding our commercial operationsand seeking regulatory approvals outside of the United States, we will need to establish and expand business relationships withvarious third parties and we will interact more frequently with foreign officials, including regulatory authorities. Expanded programsto maintain compliance with such laws will be costly and may not be effective. Any interactions with any such parties or individualswhere compensation is provided that are found to be in violation of such laws could result in substantial fines and penalties andcould materially harm our business. Furthermore, any finding of a violation under one country’s laws may increase the likelihoodthat we will be prosecuted and be found to have violated another country’s laws. If our business practices outside the UnitedStates are found to be in violation of the FCPA, UK Anti-Bribery Act or other similar law, we may be subject to significant civiland criminal penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Risks Relating to our Common Stock Our stock price has been volatile, which could result in substantiallosses for investors. Our common stock is quoted on the New York Stock Exchange, and therehas been historical volatility in the market price of our common stock. The trading price of our common stock has been, and islikely to continue to be, subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors, including:35•fluctuations in our quarterly operating and earnings per share results;•the gain or loss of significant contracts;•the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets;•loss of key personnel;•announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors;•delays in the development and introduction of new products;•legislative or regulatory changes;•general trends in the industries we operate;•recommendations and/or changes in estimates by equity and market research analysts;•biological or medical discoveries;•disputes and/or developments concerning intellectual property, including patents and litigation matters;•public concern as to the safety of new technologies;•sales of common stock of existing holders;•securities class action or other litigation;•developments in our relationships with current or future customers and suppliers and;•general economic conditions, both in the United States and worldwide. In addition, the stock market in general has experienced extremeprice and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of our common stock, as well as the stock of many companies inour industries. Often, price fluctuations are unrelated to operating performance of the specific companies whose stock is affected. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market priceof a company’s stock, securities class action litigation has occurred against the issuing company. If we were subject tothis type of litigation in the future, we could incur substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention andresources, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings. Any adverse determination in this typeof litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities. Because we do not intend to pay cash dividends on our commonstock, an investor in our common stock will benefit only if it appreciates in value. We currently intend to retain our retained earnings and future earnings,if any, to finance the expansion of our business and do not expect to pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeablefuture. As a result, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon any future appreciation. Thereis no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which investors purchased their shares. It may be difficult for a third party to acquire us, which couldinhibit stockholders from realizing a premium on their stock price. We are subject to the New York anti-takeoverlaws regulating corporate takeovers. These anti-takeover laws prohibit certain business combinations between a New York corporationand any “interested shareholder” (generally, the beneficial owner of 20% or more of the corporation’s votingshares) for five years following the time that the shareholder became an interested shareholder, unless the corporation’sboard of directors approved the transaction prior to the interested shareholder becoming interested. Our certificate of incorporation, as amended, and by-laws containprovisions that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us that stockholders may considerfavorable or beneficial. These provisions could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to electdirectors and take other corporate actions. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to payin the future for shares of our common stock. These provisions include: •a staggered board of directors, so that it would take three successive annual meetings to replace all directors; and•advance notice requirements for the submission by stockholders of nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting. Future sales of shares of our common stock or the issuance ofsecurities senior to our common stock could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our ability to raise fundsin new equity offerings. We are not restricted from issuing additional common stock, preferredstock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock. Future sales of a substantial number of our shares of commonstock or equity-related securities in the public market or privately, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adverselyaffect prevailing trading prices of our common stock, and could impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings ofequity or equity-related securities. No prediction can be made as to the effect, if any, that future sales of shares of commonstock or the availability of shares of common stock for future sale will have on the trading price of our common stock.36Our failure to establish and maintain effective internal controlsover financial reporting and information technology access could result in material misstatements in our consolidated financialstatements, our failure to meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information,which in turn could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and rules promulgated bythe SEC, companies are required to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of their internal control over financial reporting. As partof this process, we are required to document and test our internal control over financial reporting; management is required toassess and issue a report concerning our internal control over financial reporting; and our independent registered public accountingfirm is required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financialreporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error,the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud.Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deteriorationin the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system,misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be prevented or detected timely. Even effective internal controls over financialreporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. The existence of a material weakness could result in errors in our financial statementsthat could result in a restatement of financial statements, which could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, leadto a loss of investor confidence and have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock. "
9,ENZ,ENZO BIOCHEM INC,2018-10-15,"Risk Factors
 Business Risks Our operating results may vary from period to period. Our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarterand from year to year, depending on a variety of factors including: •competitive conditions, including changes in third-party reimbursements;  •health care reform regulations affecting providers and plan sponsors, including those stemming from the Affordable Care    Act (ACA) (or its repeal, amendment or replacement);  •changes in reimbursement policies from third party payers;  •Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;  •changes in tax laws, the results of tax audits or the measurement of tax uncertainties;  •the timing of our research and development, sales and marketing expenses;  •the introduction of new products by us or our competitors;  •the success of identifying, acquiring and integrating businesses that complement our product offerings, add new technology    or add presence in a market;  •expenses associated with defending our intellectual property portfolio;  •customer demand for our products due to changes in purchasing requirements and research needs;  •general worldwide economic conditions affecting funding of research; and  •seasonal fluctuations affected by weather and holiday periods. Consequently, results for any interim period may not necessarilybe indicative of results in subsequent periods. A significant proportion of our sales are to academic centers,funded by government grants in our major markets globally. Governments around the world have been reviewing long term publicfunding of life science research in response to the problems arising from global financial pressures. As a result, the availablefunds for discretionary purchases from market to market have been capped or reduced based on available National budgets. Reducedgrants for researchers could impact our business, in the amount, price and type of products bought and used by customers. A significant proportion of our sales are to customers in pharmaceuticaland biotech companies. Globally, pharmaceutical companies are challenging internal budgets,and the return of investment from their R&D spend. This could impact our business, in the amount, price and type of productsbought and used by customers. Our future success will depend in part upon our ability to enhanceexisting products, develop and introduce new products and realize commercial acceptance of those products, in a rapidly changingtechnological environment. The market for our products is characterized by rapidly changingtechnology, evolving industry standards and new product introductions, which may make our existing products obsolete. Our futuresuccess will depend in part upon our ability to enhance existing products, develop and introduce new products, and realize commercialacceptance of those products.24The development of new or enhanced products is a complex and uncertainprocess requiring the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends as well as precise technological execution. In addition,the successful development of new products will depend on the development of new technologies. We will be required to undertaketime-consuming and costly development activities and to seek regulatory approval for these new products. We may experience difficultiesthat could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of these new products. Regulatory clearanceor approval of any new products may not be granted by the FDA, state-wide agency or foreign regulatory authorities on a timelybasis, or at all, and the new products may not be successfully commercialized. We may be unable to identify, acquire and integrate acquisitiontargets. Our strategy envisions, if an opportunistic target is identified,future growth from acquiring and integrating similar operations and/or product or services lines. There can be no assurance thatwe will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates and, once identified, to negotiate successfully their acquisition ata price or on terms and conditions favorable to us, or to integrate the operations of such acquired businesses with the existingoperations. In addition, we compete for acquisition candidates with other entities, some of which have greater financial resourcesthan ours. Failure to implement successfully our acquisition strategy would limit our potential growth. Our inability to carry out certain of our marketing and salesplans may make it difficult for us to grow or maintain our business. The Life Sciences product segment continues a marketing programdesigned to more directly service its end users, while simultaneously promoting the Enzo Life Science brand, with reference toour acquired brands. We will continue to reach out to our customers using our direct field sales force, in-house business team,the on-going enhancement of our interactive websites, continued attendance at top industry trade meetings, and publications tocustomers and in leading scientific journals. In addition to our direct sales, we operate worldwide through wholly-owned subsidiaries(in USA, Switzerland, Belgium, Germany, and the UK), a branch office in France and a network of third-party distributors in mostother significant markets. If we are unable to successfully continue these programs, we may be unable to grow and our businesscould suffer. We face significant competition, which could cause us to decreasethe prices for our products or services or render our products uneconomical or obsolete, any of which could reduce our revenuesand limit our growth. Our competitors in the biotechnology industry in the United Statesand abroad are numerous and include major pharmaceutical, energy, food and chemical companies, as well as specialized genetic engineeringfirms. Many of our large competitors have substantially greater resources than us and have the capability of developing productswhich compete directly with our products. Many of these companies are performing research in the same areas as we are. The marketsfor our products are also subject to competitive risks because markets are highly price competitive. Our competitors have competedin the past by lowering prices on certain products. The clinical laboratory services business is highly fragmented andintensely competitive, and we compete with numerous national and local companies. Some of these entities are larger than we areand have greater resources than we do. We compete primarily on the basis of the quality of our testing, reporting and informationservices, our reputation in the medical community, the pricing of our services and our ability to employ qualified professionals. These competitive conditions could, among other things: •Require us to reduce our prices to retain market share;  •Require us to increase our marketing efforts which could reduce our profit margins;  •Increase our cost of labor to attract qualified personnel;  •Render our biotechnology products uneconomical or obsolete or;  •Reduce our revenue. Ethical, legal and social concerns surrounding the use of geneticinformation could reduce demand for our products. Genetic testing has raised ethical issues regarding privacy andthe appropriate uses of the resulting information. For these reasons, governmental authorities may call for limits on or regulationof the use of genetic testing or prohibit testing for genetic predisposition to certain conditions, particularly for those thathave no known cure. Similarly, such concerns may lead individuals to refuse to use genetics tests even if permissible. Any of these scenarios couldreduce the potential markets for our molecular diagnostic products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business,financial condition and results of operations.25We depend on distributors and contract manufacturers and suppliers for materials that could impair our ability to manufacture ordistribute our products. We manufacture and distribute our own brand products and the productsof third party manufacturers and suppliers. Distributors also sell our branded products. To the extent we are unable to maintainor replace a distributor in a reasonable time period, or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, our operations could be disrupted. Outside distributors, suppliers and contract manufacturers providekey finished goods, components and raw materials used in the sale and manufacture of our products. Although we believe that alternativesources for components and raw materials are available, any supply interruption in a limited or sole source component or raw materialwould harm our ability to manufacture our products until a new source of supply is identified and qualified. In addition, an uncorrecteddefect or supplier’s variation in a component or raw material, either unknown to us or incompatible with our manufacturingprocess, could harm our ability to manufacture products. We might not be able to find a sufficient alternative supplier in a reasonabletime period, or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we fail to obtain a supplier for the components of our products,our operations could be disrupted. We use hazardous materials in our business. Any claims relatingto improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials could be costly and time-consuming. Our manufacturing, clinical laboratory and research and developmentprocesses involve the storage, use and disposal of hazardous substances, including hazardous chemicals, biological hazardous materialsand radioactive compounds. We are subject to governmental regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposalof materials and waste products. Although we believe that our safety and environmental management practices and procedures forhandling and disposing of these hazardous materials are in accordance with good industry practice and comply with applicable laws,permits, licenses and regulations, the risk of accidental environmental or human contamination or injury from the release or exposureof hazardous materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for any damages thatresult, including environmental clean-up or decontamination costs, and any such liability could exceed the limits of, or fall outsidethe coverage of, our insurance. We may not be able to maintain insurance on acceptable terms, orat all. We could be required to incur significant costs to comply with current or future environmental and public and workplacesafety and health laws and regulations. We are required to expend significant resources for researchand development for our products in development and these products may not be developed successfully. Failure to successfully developthese products may prevent us from earning a return on our research and development expenditures. The products we are developing are at various stages of developmentand clinical evaluations and may require further technical development and investment to determine whether commercial applicationis practicable. There can be no assurance that our efforts will result in products with valuable commercial applications. Our cashrequirements may vary materially from current estimates because of results of our research and development programs, competitiveand technological advances and other factors. In any event, we will require substantial funds to conduct development activitiesand pre-clinical and clinical trials, apply for regulatory approvals and commercialize products, if any, that are developed. We do not have any commitments or arrangements to obtain any additionalfinancing and there is no assurance that required financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. Even if wespend substantial amounts on research and development, our potential products may not be developed successfully. If our product candidates on which we have expended significantamounts for research and development are not commercialized, we will not earn a return on our research and development expenditures,which may harm our business. We rely on network and information systems and other technologywhose failure or misuse could cause a disruption of services or loss or improper disclosure of personal data, business information,including intellectual property, or other confidential information, resulting in increased costs, loss of revenue or other harmto our business.  Network and information systems and other technologies, includingthose related to the Company’s network management, are important to its business activities. The Company also relies on thirdparty providers for certain technology and “cloud-based” systems and services that support a variety of business operations.Network and information systems-related events affecting the Company’s systems, or those of third parties upon which theCompany’s business relies, such as computer compromises, cyber threats and attacks, computer viruses, worms or other destructiveor disruptive software, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious activities,or any combination of the foregoing, as well as power outages, equipment failure, natural disasters (including extreme weather),terrorist activities, war, human or technological error or malfeasance that may affect such systems, could result in disruptionof the Company’s business and/or loss, corruption or improper disclosure of personal data, business 26information, includingintellectual property, or other confidential information. In addition, any design or manufacturing defects in, or the improperimplementation of, hardware or software applications the Company develops or procures from third parties couldunexpectedly compromise information security. In recent years, therehas been a rise in the number of cyber-attacks on companies’ network and information systems, and such attacks have becomemore sophisticated, targeted and difficult to detect and prevent against. As a result, the risks associated with such an eventcontinue to increase, particularly as the Company’s digital businesses expand. While the Company has developed and implementedsecurity measures and internal controls that are designed to protect personal data, business information, including intellectualproperty, and other confidential information, to prevent data loss, and to prevent or detect security breaches, such security measurescannot provide absolute security and may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring, particularly given that techniquesused to access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, and any network and information systems-relatedevents could require the Company to expend significant resources to remedy such event. Moreover, the development and maintenanceof these measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome securitymeasures become more sophisticated. While the Company maintains cyber risk insurance, this insurance may not be sufficient to coverall losses from any future breaches of our systems. A significant failure, compromise, breach or interruption of theCompany’s systems, or those of third parties upon which its business relies, could result in a disruption of its operations,customer, audience or advertiser dissatisfaction, damage to its reputation or brands, regulatory investigations and enforcementactions, lawsuits, remediation costs, a loss of customers, advertisers or revenues and other financial losses. If any such failure,interruption or similar event results in the improper disclosure of information maintained in the Company’s information systemsand networks or those of its vendors, including financial, personal, credit card, confidential and proprietary information relatingto personnel, customers, vendors and the Company’s business, including its intellectual property, the Company could alsobe subject to liability under relevant contractual obligations and laws and regulations protecting personal data and privacy. Inaddition, media or other reports of perceived security vulnerabilities to our systems or those of third parties upon which theCompany’s business relies, even if nothing has actually been attempted or occurred, could also adversely impact our brandand reputation and materially affect our business. Risks relating to our Intellectual Property and RegulatoryApproval Protecting our proprietary rights is difficult and costly. Ifwe fail to adequately protect or enforce our proprietary rights, we could lose potential revenue from licensing and royalties. Our potential revenue and success depends in large part on our abilityto obtain, maintain and enforce our patents. Our ability to commercialize any product successfully will largely depend on our abilityto obtain and maintain patents of sufficient scope to prevent third parties from developing similar or competitive products. Inthe absence of patent protection, competitors may impact our business by developing and marketing substantially equivalent productsand technology. Patent disputes are frequent and can preclude the commercializationof products. We have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be, involved in material patent litigation, such asthe matters discussed under “Part I - Item 3. Legal Proceedings” in this report. Patent protection litigation is time-consumingand we have incurred and anticipate continuing to incur significant legal costs. In addition, an adverse decision could force usto either obtain third-party licenses at a material cost or cease using the technology or product in dispute. We have filed applications for United States and foreign patentscovering certain aspects of our technology, but there is no assurance that pending patents will issue or as to the degree of protectionwhich any issued patent might afford. Lawsuits, including patent infringements, in the biotechnologyindustry are not uncommon. If we become involved in any significant litigation, we would suffer as a result of the diversion ofour management’s attention, the expense of litigation and any judgments against us. In addition to intellectual property litigation for infringement,other substantial, complex or extended litigation could result in large expenditures by us and distraction of our management. Patentlitigation is time-consuming and costly in its own right and could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties. In addition,an adverse decision could force us to either obtain third-party licenses at a material cost or cease using the technology or productin dispute. In addition, lawsuits by employees, stockholders, collaborators or distributors could be very costly and substantiallydisrupt our business. Disputes from time to time with companies or individuals are not uncommon in the biotechnology industry,and we cannot assure you that we will always be able to resolve them out of court. We also utilize certain unpatented proprietary technology and noassurance can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary technology, that such proprietarytechnology will not be disclosed or that we can meaningfully protect our rights to such proprietary technology.27Our businessis subject to governmental laws and regulations. Changes in the way the FDA regulates the reagents, and other consumableswe use when developing, validating, and performing our tests could result in delay or additional expense in bringing our teststo market or performing such tests for our customers. We may be unable to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals for ourproducts, which could reduce our revenue or prevent us from earning a return on our research and development expenditures. Our research, preclinical development, clinical trials, productmanufacturing and marketing are subject to regulation by the FDA and similar health authorities in foreign countries. FDA approvalis required for our products, as well as the manufacturing processes and facilities, if any, used to produce our products thatmay be sold in the United States. The process of obtaining approvals from the FDA is costly, time consuming and often subject tounanticipated delays. Even if regulatory approval is granted, such approval may include significant limitations on indicated usesfor which any products could be marketed. Further, even if such regulatory approvals are obtained, a marketed product and its manufacturerare subject to continued review, and later discovery of previously unknown problems may result in restrictions on such productor manufacturer, including withdrawal of the product from the market. New government regulations in the United States or foreign countriesalso may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development. Further, because genetherapy is a relatively new technology and has not been extensively tested in humans, the regulatory requirements governing genetherapy products are uncertain and may be subject to substantial further review by various regulatory authorities in the UnitedStates and abroad. This uncertainty may result in extensive delays in initiating clinical trials and in the regulatory approvalprocess. Our failure to obtain regulatory approval of our proposed products, processes or facilities could have a material adverseeffect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The proposed products under development may also be subjectto certain other federal, state and local government regulations, including, but not limited to, the Federal Food, Drug and CosmeticAct, the Environmental Protection Act, and Occupational Safety and Health Act, and state, local and foreign counterparts to certainof such acts. In November 2013 the FDA issued a Guidancedocument entitled “Distribution of In Vitro Diagnostic Products Labeled for Research Use Only or Investigational UseOnly,” or the RUO Guidance, which highlights the FDA’s interpretation that distribution of RUO products with any labeling,advertising or promotion that suggests that clinical laboratories can validate the test through their own procedures and subsequentlyoffer it for clinical diagnostic use as an LDT is in conflict with RUO status. The RUO Guidance further articulates the FDA’s positionthat any assistance offered in performing clinical validation or verification, or similar specialized technical support, to clinicallaboratories, is in conflict with RUO status. More recently, on October 3, 2014, the FDA announced the availability of a draftguidance entitled “Framework for Regulatory Oversight of Laboratory-Developed Tests,” a risk-based oversight frameworkfor LDTs. If the draft guidance is finalized as presently written, such oversight framework includes a premarket review for higher-riskLDTs, such as those that have the same intended use as an FDA-approved or cleared companion diagnostic currently on the market,as well as other high risk and moderate risk LDTs over time. As a result of the draft guidance, we may be required to seek clearanceor approval to offer our tests for clinical use earlier than we otherwise might have done. If we engage in any activities thatare in conflict with the RUO status held by some of the tests that we sell or intend to sell, we may be subject to immediate, severeand broad FDA enforcement action that would adversely affect our ability to continue operations. Accordingly, if the FDA findsthat we are distributing our RUO products in a manner that is inconsistent with its guidance, we may be forced to stop distributionof our RUO tests until we are in compliance, which, would reduce our revenue, increase our costs and adversely affect our business,prospects, results of operations and financial condition. We cannot be sure that we can obtain necessary regulatory approvalson a timely basis, if at all, for any of the products we are developing or manufacturing or that we can maintain necessary regulatoryapprovals for our existing products, and all of the following could have a material adverse effect on our business: •significant delays in obtaining or failing to obtain required approvals;  •loss of, or changes to, previously obtained approvals;  •failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements and;  •changes to manufacturing processes, manufacturing process standards or Good Manufacturing Practices following approval    or changing interpretations of these factors. Adverse perception and increased regulatory scrutiny of genemedicine and genetic research might limit our ability to conduct our business. Ethical, social and legal concerns about gene medicine, genetictesting and genetic research could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting the technologies we or our collaboratorsmay use. Recently, gene medicine studies have come under increasing scrutiny, which has delayed on-going and could delay futureclinical trials and regulatory approvals. Federal and state28agencies, congressional committees and foreign governments haveexpressed interest in further regulating biotechnology. More restrictive regulations or claims that our products are unsafe orpose a hazard could prevent us from commercializing any products. Financial Risks With the exception of 2016, we have experienced significant lossesin our previous five fiscal years and quarter to quarter over such periods and our losses have resulted in the use of cash in operations.If such losses and cash uses continue, the value of your investment could decline significantly. Although for fiscal year 2016, we reported net income of $45.3 million,we incurred net losses of $10.3 million and $2.5 million for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2018 and 2017 respectively. If ourrevenues do not increase, or if our operating expenses exceed expectations or cannot be reduced, we will continue to suffer substantiallosses and use cash in operations which could have an adverse effect on our business and adversely affect your investment in ourCompany. We may need additional capital to fund growth, which may notbe available on acceptable terms or at all, and could result in our business plan being limited and our business being harmed. Our ability to increase revenue and improve profitability and liquiditywill depend in part on our ability to grow our products business with higher margin products and increase our market share andcontinue to grow the Laboratory Services business with new tests with higher reimbursements and increase our service volume whichmay require significant additional capital that may not be available to us. We may need additional financing due to future developments,changes in our business plan or failure of our current business plan to succeed, which could result from increased marketing, distributionor research and development costs. Our actual funding requirements could vary materially from our current estimates. If additionalfinancing is needed, we may not be able to raise sufficient funds on favourable terms or at all. If we issue common stock or securitiesconvertible into common stock in the future, such issuance will result in the then-existing stockholders sustaining dilution totheir relative proportion of our outstanding equity. If we fail to obtain any necessary financing on a timely basis, then our abilityto execute our current business plan may be limited, and our business, liquidity and financial condition could be harmed. We may incur impairment charges on our goodwill and intangibleswhich would reduce our earnings. We are subject to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ASC350, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (“ASC 350”) which requires that goodwill and other intangible assets thathave an indefinite life be tested at least annually for impairment. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite livesmust also be tested for impairment between the annual tests if a triggering event occurs that would likely reduce the fair valueof the asset below its carrying amount. As of July 31, 2018 and 2017, goodwill and intangible assets representedapproximately 9% and 10%, respectively, of our total assets. If we determine that there has been impairment, our financial resultsfor the relevant period would be reduced by the amount of the impairment, net of tax effects, if any. The Company has no intangibleassets with indefinite lives. Risks relating to our Clinical Laboratory Services segment Our clinical laboratory services business is subject to extensivegovernment regulation and our loss of any required certifications or licenses could require us to cease operating this part ofour business, which would reduce our revenue and injure our reputation. The clinical laboratory industry is subject to significant governmentalregulation at the Federal, state and local levels. Under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act of 1967 and the Clinical LaboratoryImprovement Amendments of 1988 (collectively, as amended, “CLIA”) virtually all clinical laboratories, including ours,must be certified by the Federal government. Many clinical laboratories also must meet other governmental standards, undergo proficiencytesting and are subject to inspection. Certifications or licenses are also required by various state and local laws. The failureof our clinical laboratory to obtain or maintain such certifications or licenses under these laws could interrupt our ability tooperate our clinical laboratory business and injure our reputation. The Protecting Access to Medicare Act (“PAMA”)of 2014 includes a substantial new payment system for clinical laboratory tests under the Clinical LaboratoryFee Schedule, or CLFS and has impacted the clinical laboratory testing industry. Key parts of this legislation include provisionsthat provide for the establishment of an advisory panel and a market-based process to rebase the clinical laboratory fee schedule,developing a new fee schedule and limiting reductions in that fee schedule. If this process does not recognize the value that clinicallaboratory testing brings to the healthcare system, our business can be materially adversely impacted.29Reimbursements from third-party payers including managed careorganizations and Medicare, upon which our clinical laboratory business is dependent, are subject to inconsistent rates and coverageand legislative reform that are beyond our control. This inconsistency and any reform that decreases coverage and rates could reduceour earnings and harm our business. Our clinical laboratory services business is primarily dependentupon reimbursement from third-party payers, such as Medicaid, Medicare (which principally serves patients 65 and older) and commercialinsurers. We are subject to variances in reimbursement rates among different third-party payers, as well as constant renegotiationof those reimbursement rates. Government and non-government payers have in the past sought, and continueto seek, to reduce and limit utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services, including the areas of clinical and genetictesting. We also are subject to audit by Medicare and the commercial insurers, which can result in the return of paymentsmade to us under these programs. These variances in reimbursement rates and audit results could reduce our margins and thus ourearnings. The health care industry continues to undergo significant changeas third-party payers’ increase their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of health care services. In aneffort to address the problem of increasing health care costs, legislation has been proposed or enacted at both the Federal andstate levels to regulate health care delivery in general and clinical laboratories in particular. Some of the proposals includemanaged competition, global budgeting and price controls. Changes that decrease reimbursement rates or coverage, or increase administrativeburdens on billing third-party payers could reduce our revenues and increase our expenses. Since each payer makes its own decision as to whether to establisha policy or enter into a contract to cover our tests, as well as the amount it will reimburse for a test, seeking these approvalsis a time-consuming and costly process. In addition, the determination by a payer to cover and the amount it will reimburse forour tests will likely be made on an indication by indication basis. To date, we have obtained policy-level reimbursement approvalor contractual reimbursement for some indications for our test from a small number of commercial third-party payers, and have notobtained coverage from Medicare or any state Medicaid program. Further, we believe that establishing adequate reimbursement fromMedicare is an important factor in gaining adoption from healthcare providers. Our claims for reimbursement from commercial payersmay be denied upon submission, and we must appeal the claims. The appeals process is time consuming and expensive, and may notresult in payment. In cases where there is not a contracted rate for reimbursement, there is typically a greater co-insurance orco-payment requirement from the patient which may result in further delay or decreased likelihood of collection. We expect to continue to focus substantial resources on increasingadoption of, and coverage and reimbursement for, our current tests and any future tests we may develop. We believe it may takeseveral years to achieve coverage and adequate contracted reimbursement with a majority of third-party payers. However, we cannotpredict whether, under what circumstances, or at what payment levels payers will reimburse for our tests. If we fail to establishand maintain broad adoption of, and coverage and reimbursement for, our tests, our ability to generate revenue could be harmedand our future prospects and our business could suffer. U.S. healthcare reform legislation may result in significantchange and our business could be adversely impacted if we fail to adapt. Government oversight of and attention to the healthcare industryin the United States is significant and increasing. Under the Patient Protections and affordable Care Act, expansion in the poolof covered lives may expand the market for clinical diagnostic testing while at the same time, various policies aimed at reducingcosts or bundling care may reduce the rates paid for such services’ the net impact of these factors on the market for ourtests is not clear. In April 2014, Congress passed the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, which include substantial changesto the way in which clinical laboratory services will be paid under Medicare. Beginning on January 1, 2018, Medicare payments forclinical laboratory services are paid based upon private payer rates reported by clinical laboratories across the US replacingthe current system, which is based upon fee schedules derived from historical charges for test from approximately 30 years ago.While we believe that the new rates will have minimal impact on our business, it is unclear whether and to what extent the newrates will affect overall pricing and reimbursement for clinical laboratory testing services. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act also imposes an excisetax on the seller for the sale of certain medical devices in the United States, including those purchased and used by laboratories,beginning in 2013. The legislation also establishes the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which will be responsible, beginningin 2014, annually to submit proposals aimed at reducing Medicare cost growth while preserving quality. If the projected growthin per capita Medicare costs exceeds a specified target level, the IPAB must submit proposals to reduce or eliminate the difference.For calendar years 2015 through 2019, the target growth rate is the projected average of the increases in the Consumer Price Indexand the medical care expenditure category of the Consumer Price Index; for 2020 and thereafter, the target growth rate is the rateof increase in gross domestic product per capita plus one percentage point. If it is necessary for the IPAB to submit proposals,they will automatically be implemented unless Congress enacts alternative proposals that achieve the same savings targets.30Further, the legislation calls for a Center for Medicare and MedicaidInnovation that will examine alternative payment methodologies and conduct demonstration programs. The legislation provides forextensive health insurance reforms, including the elimination of pre-existing condition exclusions and other limitations on coverage,fixed percentages on medical loss ratios, expansion in Medicaid and other programs, employer mandates, individual mandates, creationof state and regional health insurance exchanges, and tax subsidies for individuals to help cover the cost of individual insurancecoverage. The legislation also permits the establishment of accountable care organizations, a new healthcare delivery model. Whilethe ultimate impact of the legislation on the healthcare industry is unknown, it is likely to be extensive and may result in significantchange. Our failure to adapt to these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business. Changes in provider mix, including continued growth in capitatedmanaged-cost health care and changes in certain third party provider agreements could have a material adverse impact on the Company’snet revenues and profitability. Certain third party provider companies have adopted national andregional programs which include multiple managed-care reimbursement models. If the Company is unable to participate in these programsor if the Company would lose a material contract, it could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s net revenues andprofitability. The number of individuals covered under managed care contracts orother similar arrangements has grown over the past several years and may continue to grow in the future. In addition, Medicareand other government healthcare programs may continue to shift to managed care. Entities providing managed care coverage have reducedpayments for medical services, including clinical laboratory services, in numerous ways such as entering into arrangements underwhich payments to a service provider are capitated, limiting testing to specified procedures, denying payment for services performedwithout prior authorization and refusing to increase fees for specified services. These trends reduce our revenues and limit ourability to pass cost increases to our customers. Also, if these or other managed care organizations do not select us as a participatingprovider, we may lose some or all of that business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition andresults of operations. Because of competitive pressures, impacts of the economy on patientvisits to our customer physician locations and the complexity and expense of the billing process in our clinical laboratory servicesbusiness, we must obtain new customers while maintaining existing customers to grow our business. Intense competition in the clinical laboratory business, increasingadministrative burdens upon the reimbursement process, reduced patient traffic, and reduced coverage and payments by insurers makeit necessary for us to increase our volume of laboratory services. To do so, we must obtain new customers while retaining existingcustomers. Our failure to attract new customers or the loss of existing customersor a reduction in business from those customers could significantly reduce our revenues and impede our ability to grow. Compliance with Medicare administrative policies, including thosepertaining to certain automated blood chemistry profiles, may reduce the reimbursements we receive. Containment of health care costs, including reimbursement for clinicallaboratory services, has been a focus of on-going governmental activity. Clinical laboratories must bill Medicare directly forthe services provided to Medicare beneficiaries and may only collect the amounts permitted under this fee schedule. Reimbursementto clinical laboratories under the Medicare Fee Schedule has been steadily declining since its inception. Because a significantportion of our costs is fixed, these Medicare reimbursement reductions and changes have a direct adverse effect on our net earningsand cash flows. The development of new, more cost-effective tests that can beperformed by our customers or by patients, and the continued internalization of testing by hospitals or physicians, could negativelyimpact our testing volume and revenues. The diagnostic industry is faced with changing technology and newproduct introductions, including technology that enables more convenient or cost-effective testing. Some of our competitors alsomay offer testing to be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory, such as point-of-care testing that can be performedby physicians in their offices; complex testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories; and home testingthat can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers. Advances in technology also may lead to the need for less frequenttesting. Further, diagnostic tests approved or cleared by the FDA for home use are automatically deemed to be “waived”tests under CLIA and may be performed by patients in their homes; test kit manufacturers could seek to increase sales to patientsof such test kits. Development of such technology and its use by our customers would reduce the demand for our laboratory-basedtesting services and negatively impact our revenues. Our business could be harmed from the loss or suspension of alicense or imposition of a fine or penalties under, or future changes in, or changing interpretations of, CLIA or state laboratorylicensing laws to which we are subject.31The clinical laboratory testing industry is subject to extensivefederal and state regulation, and many of these statutes and regulations have not been interpreted by the courts. The ClinicalLaboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA, are federal regulatory standards that apply to virtually all clinical laboratories(regardless of the location, size or type of laboratory), including those operated by physicians in their offices, by requiringthat they be certified by the federal government or by a federally approved accreditation agency. CLIA does not pre-empt statelaw, which in some cases may be more stringent than federal law and require additional personnel qualifications, quality control,record maintenance and proficiency testing. The sanction for failure to comply with CLIA and state requirements may be suspension,revocation or limitation of a laboratory’s CLIA certificate, which is necessary to conduct business, as well as significantfines and/or criminal penalties. Several states have similar laws and we may be subject to similar penalties. We cannot assure that applicable statutes and regulations will notbe interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely affect our business.Potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include significant fines and the suspension or loss of variouslicenses, certificates and authorizations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, compliancewith future legislation could impose additional requirements on us, which may be costly. Regulations requiring the use of “standard transactions”for healthcare services may negatively impact our profitability and cash flows. The administrative simplification provisions of the Health InsurancePortability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its implementing regulations, or HIPAA, were designed to improve the efficiencyand effectiveness of the healthcare system by facilitating the electronic exchange of information in certain financial and administrativetransactions while protecting the privacy and security of the information exchanged. The administrative simplification provisionsaddress standards for electronic transactions, security regulations and privacy regulations. The HIPAA transaction standards are complex, and subject to differencesin interpretation by payers. For instance, some payers may interpret the standards to require us to provide certain types of information,including demographic information not usually provided to us by physicians. While most of our transactions are submitted and/orreceived in ANSI standard format, inconsistent application of transaction standards by some remaining payers or our inability toobtain certain billing information not usually provided to us by physicians could increase our costs and the complexity of billing.In addition, new requirements for additional standard transactions, such as claims attachments, could prove technically difficult,time-consuming or expensive to implement. We are working closely with our payers to establish acceptable protocols for claims submissionsand with our industry trade association and an industry coalition to present issues and problems as they arise to the appropriateregulators and standards setting organizations. Compliance with the HIPAA security, privacy and breach notificationregulations and privacy regulations may increase our costs. The HIPAA privacy and security and breach notification regulationsestablish comprehensive federal standards with respect to the uses and disclosures PHI by Covered Entities. These regulations wererecently amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, orHITECH, to, among other things directly apply to business associates (i.e., individuals or entities who create, receive, maintainor transmit PHI on behalf of a Covered Entity in performing functions or activities regulated by HIPAA or who perform certain services,other than treatment, on behalf of Covered Entities and receive PHI in order to perform such services) with regard to certain requirements.The regulations also specify that business associates include subcontractors that create, receive, maintain or transmit PHI onbehalf of a business associate. The regulations establish a complex regulatory framework on a variety of subjects, including:  ▪the circumstances under which uses and disclosures of PHI are permitted or required without a specific    authorization by the patient, including but not limited to treatment purposes, activities to obtain payments for our services,    and our healthcare operations activities;    ▪a patient’s rights to access, amend and receive an accounting of certain disclosures of PHI;    ▪requirements to notify individuals if there is a breach of their PHI;    ▪the requirements for business associates and the terms of business associate agreements;    ▪the content of notices of privacy practices for protected health information and;    ▪administrative, technical and physical safeguards required of entities that use or receive PHI.32We have implemented practices to meet the requirements of the HIPAAprivacy, security and breach notification regulations, and updated these practices to comply with HITECH. HIPAA establishes a “floor”and does not supersede state laws that are more stringent. Therefore, we are required to comply with federal privacy security andbreach notification regulations and varying state privacy, security and breach notification laws and regulations. In addition,for healthcare data transfers from other countries relating to citizens of those countries, we must comply with the laws of thoseother countries. The federal privacy regulations restrict our ability to use or disclose patient-identifiable laboratory data,without patient authorization, for purposes other than payment, treatment, healthcare operations and certain other specified disclosuressuch as public health and governmental oversight of the health care industry. The privacy, security and breach notification regulationsprovide for significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of PHI, including potential civil and criminalfines and penalties. Although the HIPAA statute and regulations do not expressly provide for a private right of damages, we alsocould incur damages under state laws to private parties for the wrongful use or disclosure of confidential health information orother private personal information. Compliance with all of the HIPAA regulations, including standardtransactions, requires on-going resources from all healthcare organizations, not just clinical laboratories. While we believe ourtotal costs to comply with HIPAA will not be material to our operations or cash flows, new standard transactions and additionalcustomer requirements resulting from different interpretations of the current regulations could impose additional costs on us. FDA regulation of laboratory-developed tests, analyte specificreagents, or genetic testing could lead to increased costs and delays in introducing new genetic tests. The FDA has regulatory responsibility over, among other areas, instruments,test kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories to perform diagnostic testing in the U.S. A number of testswe develop internally are offered as lab developed tests (LDTs). The FDA has claimed regulatory authority over all LDTs, but hasstated that it exercised enforcement discretion with regard to most LDTs performed by high complexity CLIA-certified laboratories.The FDA has published a “Discussion Document” that provides the FDA’s views on legislation to govern LDTs. New legislationcould significantly impact the clinical laboratory testing business, including by increasing or modifying the regulation of LDTs,hindering our ability to develop and market new services, causing an increase in the cost of our services, delaying our abilityto introduce new tests or hindering our ability to perform testing. We are subject to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuseand other laws and regulations and could face substantial penalties if we are unable to fully comply with such laws. As a provider of clinical laboratory testing services, we are subjectto extensive and frequently changing federal, state and local laws and regulations governing various aspects of our business. Forexample, we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by both the federal government and the statesin which we conduct our business. These healthcare laws and regulations include, for example:  ▪the federal Anti-Kickback Law, which constrains our marketing practices, educational    programs, pricing policies, and relationships with healthcare providers or other entities, including third-party laboratories,    by prohibiting, among other things, persons or entities from soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly    or indirectly, in return for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease order or recommendation    of, any good, facility, item or services for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program    such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;    ▪federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit,    among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from    Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent, and which may apply to entities like us to the    extent that our interactions with customers may affect their billing or coding practices;    ▪the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, or    HIPAA, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable    health information, and also established federal crimes for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare    benefit program or making false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or    services, and which imposed certain requirements relating to privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable    health information;    ▪the federal physician self-referral law, commonly known as the Stark Law, which prohibits    a physician from making a referral to an entity for certain designated health services reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid    if the physician (or a member of the physician’s family) has a financial relationship with the entity, and which also    prohibits the submission of any claims for reimbursement for designated health services furnished pursuant to a prohibited    referral;    ▪the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, and its implementing regulations, which requires    manufacturers of certain drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid    or the Children’s 33  Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the United States Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members;    ▪federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers; and    ▪state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, with differing effects. We are unable to predict what additional federal or state legislationor regulatory initiatives may be enacted in the future regarding our business or the healthcare industry in general, or what effectsuch legislation or regulations may have on us. Federal or state governments may impose additional restrictions or adopt interpretationsof existing laws that could have an adverse effect on us. We incur significant costs in complying with these laws and regulations.Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that someof our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations, or our sales techniquesor product placement strategies, are found to be in violation of, or to encourage or assist the violation by third parties of,any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, or if we fail to maintain, renew or obtainnecessary permits, licenses and approvals related to our in-house laboratory, we may be subject to penalties, including civil andcriminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputationalharm, diminished profits and future earnings, suspension or revocation of certifications or licenses that are required to operateour business, injunctions and other associated remedies, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, denial or withdrawalof product clearances, or private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government,any of which could have an adverse effect on our business. If we or others determine that any of our existing customer relationshipsdo not comply with applicable laws and regulations, either due to changes in such laws and regulations or evolving interpretationsof such laws and regulations, we may be required to renegotiate or terminate such relationships. Any penalties, damages, fines,exclusions, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financialresults. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of these laws are broad andtheir provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfullydefend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operationof our business. Other risks relating to our business If we fail to maintain or monitor our information systems ourbusinesses could be adversely affected. We depend on information systems throughout our Company to controlour manufacturing, inventory, distribution and website and the clinical laboratory services processes for: processing specimens,managing inventory, processing test results and submitting claims, collecting from insurers and patients, responding to inquiries,contributing to our overall internal control processes, maintaining records of our property, plant and equipment, and recordingand paying amounts due vendors and other creditors. If we were to experience a prolonged disruption in our information systemsthat involve interactions with customers and suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and/or increased costs,which could adversely affect our business. Cyber security risks and the failure tomaintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our computer hardware, software, and Internet applications and relatedtools and functions could result in damage to the Company’s reputation and/or subject the Company to costs, fines, or lawsuits. The integrity and protection of our own data, and that of its customersand employees, is critical to the Company’s business. The regulatory environment governing information, security and privacylaws is increasingly demanding and continues to evolve. Maintaining compliance with applicable security and privacy regulationsmay increase the Company’s operating costs and/or adversely impact the Company’s ability to market its products andservices to customers. Although the Company’s computer and communications hardware is protected through physical and softwaresafeguards, it is still vulnerable to fire, storm, flood, power loss, earthquakes, telecommunications failures, physical or softwarebreak-ins, software viruses, and similar events. These events could lead to the unauthorized access, disclosure and use of non-publicinformation. The techniques used by criminal elements to attack computer systems are sophisticated, change frequently and may originatefrom less regulated and remote areas of the world. As a result, the Company may not be able to address these techniques proactivelyor implement adequate preventative measures. If the Company’s computer systems are compromised, it could be subject to fines,damages, litigation, and enforcement actions, customers34could curtail or cease using its applications,and the Company could lose trade secrets, the occurrence of which could harm its business. If we fail to attract and retain key personnel, including oursenior management, our business could be adversely affected. Most of our products and services are highly technical in nature.In general, only highly qualified and trained scientists and technician personnel have the necessary skills to develop proprietarytechnological products and market our products, support our research and development programs and provide our clinical laboratoryservices. In addition, some of our manufacturing, quality control, safetyand compliance, information technology and e-commerce related positions are highly technical as well. Further, our sales personnelhighly trained and are important to retaining and growing our businesses. Our success depends in large part upon our ability toidentify, hire, retain and motivate highly skilled professionals. We face intense competition for these professionals from our competitors,customers, marketing partners and other companies throughout the industries in which we compete. Since our inception we have successfullyrecruited and hired qualified key employees. Any failure on our part to hire, train, and retain a sufficient number of qualifiedprofessionals would seriously damage our business. We depend heavily on the services of our senior management. We believethat our future success depends on the continued services of such management. Our business may be harmed by the loss of a significantnumber of our senior management in a short period of time. The insurance we purchase to cover our potential business riskmay be inadequate. Although we believe that our present insurance coverage is sufficientto cover our current estimated exposures, we cannot assure that we will not incur losses or liabilities in excess of our policylimits. In addition, although we believe that will be able to continue to obtain adequate coverage, we cannot assure that we willbe able to do so at acceptable costs. Risks relating to our international operations Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affectour business. Since we operate as a multinational corporation that sells and sourcesproducts in many different countries, changes in exchange rates could in the future, adversely affect our cash flows and resultsof operations. Furthermore, reported sales and purchases made in non-U.S. currenciesby our international businesses, when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes, fluctuate due to exchangerate movement. Due to the number of currencies involved, the variability of currency exposures and the potential volatility ofcurrency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on future sales and operating results. We are subject to economic, political and other risks associatedwith our significant international business, which could adversely affect our financial results. We operate internationally primarily through wholly-owned subsidiarieslocated in North America and Europe. Revenues outside the United States were approximately 9% of total revenues in fiscal 2018.Our sales and earnings could be adversely affected by a variety of factors resulting from our international operations, including •future fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;  •complex regulatory requirements and changes in those requirements;  •trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;  •multiple jurisdictions and differing tax laws, as well as changes in those laws;  •restrictions on our ability to repatriate investments and earnings from foreign operations;  •changes in the political or economic conditions in a country or region, particularly in developing or emerging markets;  •changes in shipping costs; and  •difficulties in collecting on accounts receivable.35If any of these risks materialize, we could face substantial increasesin costs, the reduction of profit and the inability to do business. As we expand our commercialization activities outside of theUnited States, we will be subject to an increased risk of inadvertently conducting activities in a manner that violates the U.S.Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws. If that occurs, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties which could havea material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”),which prohibits corporations and individuals from paying, offering to pay, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to anyforeign government official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retainbusiness or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. We are also subject to the UK Anti-Bribery Act, whichprohibits both domestic and international bribery, as well as bribery across both public and private sectors. In the course of establishing and expanding our commercial operationsand seeking regulatory approvals outside of the United States, we will need to establish and expand business relationships withvarious third parties and we will interact more frequently with foreign officials, including regulatory authorities. Expanded programsto maintain compliance with such laws will be costly and may not be effective. Any interactions with any such parties or individualswhere compensation is provided that are found to be in violation of such laws could result in substantial fines and penalties andcould materially harm our business. Furthermore, any finding of a violation under one country’s laws may increase the likelihoodthat we will be prosecuted and be found to have violated another country’s laws. If our business practices outside the UnitedStates are found to be in violation of the FCPA, UK Anti-Bribery Act or other similar law, we may be subject to significant civiland criminal penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Risks Relating to our Common Stock Our stock price has been volatile, which could result in substantiallosses for investors. Our common stock is quoted on the New York Stock Exchange, and therehas been historical volatility in the market price of our common stock. The trading price of our common stock has been, and islikely to continue to be, subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors, including: •fluctuations in our quarterly operating and earnings per share results;  •the gain or loss of significant contracts;  •the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets;  •loss of key personnel;  •announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors;  •delays in the development and introduction of new products;  •legislative or regulatory changes;  •general trends in the industries we operate;  •recommendations and/or changes in estimates by equity and market research analysts;  •biological or medical discoveries;  •disputes and/or developments concerning intellectual property, including patents and litigation matters;  •public concern as to the safety of new technologies;  •sales of common stock of existing holders;  •securities class action or other litigation;36•developments in our relationships with current or future customers and suppliers and;  •general economic conditions, both in the United States and worldwide. In addition, the stock market in general has experienced extremeprice and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of our common stock, as well as the stock of many companies inour industries. Often, price fluctuations are unrelated to operating performance of the specific companies whose stock is affected. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market priceof a company’s stock, securities class action litigation has occurred against the issuing company. If we were subject tothis type of litigation in the future, we could incur substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention andresources, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings. Any adverse determination in this typeof litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities. Because we do not intend to pay cash dividends on our commonstock, an investor in our common stock will benefit only if it appreciates in value. We currently intend to retain our retained earnings and future earnings,if any, to finance the expansion of our business and do not expect to pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeablefuture. As a result, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon any future appreciation. Thereis no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which investors purchased their shares. It may be difficult for a third party to acquire us, which couldinhibit stockholders from realizing a premium on their stock price. We are subject to the New York anti-takeoverlaws regulating corporate takeovers. These anti-takeover laws prohibit certain business combinations between a New York corporationand any “interested shareholder” (generally, the beneficial owner of 20% or more of the corporation’s votingshares) for five years following the time that the shareholder became an interested shareholder, unless the corporation’sboard of directors approved the transaction prior to the interested shareholder becoming interested. Our certificate of incorporation, as amended, and by-laws containprovisions that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us that stockholders may considerfavorable or beneficial. These provisions could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to electdirectors and take other corporate actions. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to payin the future for shares of our common stock. These provisions include: •a staggered board of directors, so that it would take three successive annual meetings to replace all    directors; and  •advance notice requirements for the submission by stockholders of nominations for election to the board of directors and    for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting. Future sales of shares of our common stock or the issuance ofsecurities senior to our common stock could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our ability to raise fundsin new equity offerings. We are not restricted from issuing additional common stock, preferredstock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock. Future sales of a substantial number of our shares of commonstock or equity-related securities in the public market or privately, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adverselyaffect prevailing trading prices of our common stock, and could impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings ofequity or equity-related securities. No prediction can be made as to the effect, if any, that future sales of shares of commonstock or the availability of shares of common stock for future sale will have on the trading price of our common stock. Our failure to establish and maintain effective internal controlsover financial reporting and information technology access could result in material misstatements in our consolidated financialstatements, our failure to meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information,which in turn could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. Under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 andrules promulgated by the SEC, companies are required to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of their internal control overfinancial reporting. As part of this process, we are required to document and test our internal control over financialreporting; management is required to assess and issue a report concerning our internal control over financial reporting; andour independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control overfinancial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of itsinherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud.37Over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditionsor deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effectivecontrol system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be prevented or detected timely. Even effective internalcontrols over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation offinancial statements. During the financial close for fiscal year 2018 we identified materialweaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting related to (1) insufficient controls to fully and timely take intoaccount changes in the business environment and experience with ultimate collection from third-party payers in the determinationof sales allowance amounts, and (2) information technology access controls. A more complete description of this material weaknessis included in Item 9A, “Controls and Procedures” in this Form 10-K. The existence of a material weakness could result in errors in ourfinancial statements that could result in a restatement of financial statements, which could cause us to fail to meet our reportingobligations, lead to a loss of investor confidence and have a negative impact on the trading price of our common stock. "
5,ENZ,ENZO BIOCHEM INC,2017-09-27,"Risk Factors
 Business Risks Our operating results may vary from period to period. Our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarterand from year to year, depending on a variety of factors including: •competitive conditions, including changes in third-party reimbursements;  •health care reform regulations affecting providers and plan sponsors, including those stemming from the Affordable Care Act (ACA) (or its repeal, amendment or replacement);  •changes in reimbursement policies from third party payers;  •Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations;  •changes in tax laws, the results of tax audits or the measurement of tax uncertainties;  •the timing of our research and development, sales and marketing expenses;  •the introduction of new products by us or our competitors;  •the success of identifying, acquiring and integrating businesses that complement our product offerings, add new technology or add presence in a market;  •expenses associated with defending our intellectual property portfolio;  •customer demand for our products due to changes in purchasing requirements and research needs;  •general worldwide economic conditions affecting funding of research; and  •seasonal fluctuations affected by weather and holiday periods. Consequently, results for any interim period may not necessarilybe indicative of results in subsequent periods. A significant proportion of our sales are to academic centers,funded by government grants in our major markets globally. Governments around the world have been reviewing long term publicfunding of life science research in response to the problems arising from global financial pressures. As a result, the availablefunds for discretionary purchases from market to market have been capped or reduced based on available National budgets. Reducedgrants for researchers could impact our business, in the amount, price and type of products bought and used by customers. A significant proportion of our sales are to customers in pharmaceuticaland biotech companies. Globally, pharmaceutical companies are challenging internal budgets,and the return of investment from their R&D spend. This could impact our business, in the amount, price and type of productsbought and used by customers. Our future success will depend in part upon our ability to enhanceexisting products, develop and introduce new products and realize commercial acceptance of those products, in a rapidly changingtechnological environment. The market for our products is characterized by rapidly changingtechnology, evolving industry standards and new product introductions, which may make our existing products obsolete. Our futuresuccess will depend in part upon our ability to enhance existing products, develop and introduce new products, and realize commercialacceptance of those products.24The development of new or enhanced products is a complex and uncertainprocess requiring the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends as well as precise technological execution. In addition,the successful development of new products will depend on the development of new technologies. We will be required to undertaketime-consuming and costly development activities and to seek regulatory approval for these new products. We may experience difficultiesthat could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of these new products. Regulatory clearanceor approval of any new products may not be granted by the FDA, state-wide agency or foreign regulatory authorities on a timelybasis, or at all, and the new products may not be successfully commercialized. We may be unable to identify, acquire and integrate acquisitiontargets. Our strategy envisions, if an opportunistic target is identified,future growth from acquiring and integrating similar operations and/or product or services lines. There can be no assurance thatwe will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates and, once identified, to negotiate successfully their acquisition ata price or on terms and conditions favorable to us, or to integrate the operations of such acquired businesses with the existingoperations. In addition, we compete for acquisition candidates with other entities, some of which have greater financial resourcesthan ours. Failure to implement successfully our acquisition strategy would limit our potential growth. Our inability to carry out certain of our marketing and salesplans may make it difficult for us to grow or maintain our business. The Life Sciences segment continues a marketing program designedto more directly service its end users, while simultaneously promoting the Enzo Life Science brand, with reference to our acquiredbrands. We will continue to reach out to our customers using our direct field sales force, in-house business team, the on-goingenhancement of our interactive websites, continued attendance at top industry trade meetings, and publications to customers andin leading scientific journals. In addition to our direct sales, we operate worldwide through wholly-owned subsidiaries (in USA,Switzerland, Belgium, Germany, and the UK), a branch office in France and a network of third-party distributors in most other significantmarkets. If we are unable to successfully continue these programs, we may be unable to grow and our business could suffer. We face significant competition, which could cause us to decreasethe prices for our products or services or render our products uneconomical or obsolete, any of which could reduce our revenuesand limit our growth. Our competitors in the biotechnology industry in the United Statesand abroad are numerous and include major pharmaceutical, energy, food and chemical companies, as well as specialized genetic engineeringfirms. Many of our large competitors have substantially greater resources than us and have the capability of developing productswhich compete directly with our products. Many of these companies are performing research in the same areas as we are. The marketsfor our products are also subject to competitive risks because markets are highly price competitive. Our competitors have competedin the past by lowering prices on certain products. The clinical laboratory business is highly fragmented and intenselycompetitive, and we compete with numerous national and local companies. Some of these entities are larger than we are and havegreater resources than we do. We compete primarily on the basis of the quality of our testing, reporting and information services,our reputation in the medical community, the pricing of our services and our ability to employ qualified professionals. These competitive conditions could, among other things: •Require us to reduce our prices to retain market share;  •Require us to increase our marketing efforts which could reduce our profit margins;  •Increase our cost of labor to attract qualified personnel;  •Render our biotechnology products uneconomical or obsolete or;  •Reduce our revenue. Ethical, legal and social concerns surrounding the use of geneticinformation could reduce demand for our products. Genetic testing has raised ethical issues regarding privacy andthe appropriate uses of the resulting information. For these reasons, governmental authorities may call for limits on or regulationof the use of genetic testing or prohibit testing for genetic predisposition to certain conditions, particularly for those thathave no known cure. Similarly, such concerns may lead individuals to refuse to use genetics tests even if permissible. Any of thesescenarios could reduce the potential markets for our molecular diagnostic products, which could have a material adverse effecton our business, financial condition and results of operations.25We depend on distributors and contract manufacturers and suppliersfor materials that could impair our ability to manufacture or distribute our products. Our Life Sciences segment manufactures and distributes our own brandproducts and the products of third party manufacturers and suppliers. Distributors also sell our branded products. To the extentwe are unable to maintain or replace a distributor in a reasonable time period, or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all,our operations could be disrupted. Outside distributors, suppliers and contract manufacturers providekey finished goods, components and raw materials used in the sale and manufacture of our products. Although we believe that alternativesources for components and raw materials are available, any supply interruption in a limited or sole source component or raw materialwould harm our ability to manufacture our products until a new source of supply is identified and qualified. In addition, an uncorrecteddefect or supplier’s variation in a component or raw material, either unknown to us or incompatible with our manufacturingprocess, could harm our ability to manufacture products. We might not be able to find a sufficient alternative supplier in a reasonabletime period, or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we fail to obtain a supplier for the components of our products,our operations could be disrupted. We use hazardous materials in our business. Any claims relatingto improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials could be costly and time-consuming. Our manufacturing, clinical laboratory and research and developmentprocesses involve the storage, use and disposal of hazardous substances, including hazardous chemicals, biological hazardous materialsand radioactive compounds. We are subject to governmental regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposalof materials and waste products. Although we believe that our safety and environmental management practices and procedures forhandling and disposing of these hazardous materials are in accordance with good industry practice and comply with applicable laws,permits, licenses and regulations, the risk of accidental environmental or human contamination or injury from the release or exposureof hazardous materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for any damages thatresult, including environmental clean-up or decontamination costs, and any such liability could exceed the limits of, or fall outsidethe coverage of, our insurance. We may not be able to maintain insurance on acceptable terms, orat all. We could be required to incur significant costs to comply with current or future environmental and public and workplacesafety and health laws and regulations. We are required to expend significant resources for researchand development for our products in development and these products may not be developed successfully. Failure to successfully developthese products may prevent us from earning a return on our research and development expenditures. The products we are developing are at various stages of developmentand clinical evaluations and may require further technical development and investment to determine whether commercial applicationis practicable. There can be no assurance that our efforts will result in products with valuable commercial applications. Our cashrequirements may vary materially from current estimates because of results of our research and development programs, competitiveand technological advances and other factors. In any event, we will require substantial funds to conduct development activitiesand pre-clinical and clinical trials, apply for regulatory approvals and commercialize products, if any, that are developed. We do not have any commitments or arrangements to obtain any additionalfinancing and there is no assurance that required financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. Even if wespend substantial amounts on research and development, our potential products may not be developed successfully. If our product candidates on which we have expended significantamounts for research and development are not commercialized, we will not earn a return on our research and development expenditures,which may harm our business. We rely on network and information systems and other technologywhose failure or misuse could cause a disruption of services or loss or improper disclosure of personal data, business information,including intellectual property, or other confidential information, resulting in increased costs, loss of revenue or other harmto our business.  Network and information systems and other technologies, includingthose related to the Company’s network management, are important to its business activities. The Company also relies on thirdparty providers for certain technology and “cloud-based” systems and services that support a variety of business operations.Network and information systems-related events affecting the Company’s systems, or those of third parties upon which theCompany’s business relies, such as computer compromises, cyber threats and attacks, computer viruses, worms or other destructiveor disruptive software, process breakdowns, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering or other malicious activities,or any combination of the foregoing, as well as power outages, equipment failure, natural disasters (including extreme weather),terrorist activities, war, human or technological error or malfeasance that may affect such systems, could result in disruptionof the Company’s business and/or loss, corruption or improper disclosure of personal data, business26information, including intellectual property,or other confidential information. In addition, any design or manufacturing defects in, or the improper implementation of, hardwareor software applications the Company develops or procures from third parties could unexpectedly compromise information security.In recent years, there has been a rise in the number of cyber-attacks on companies’ network and information systems, andsuch attacks have become more sophisticated, targeted and difficult to detect and prevent against. As a result, the risks associatedwith such an event continue to increase, particularly as the Company’s digital businesses expand. While the Company has developedand implemented security measures and internal controls that are designed to protect personal data, business information, includingintellectual property, and other confidential information, to prevent data loss, and to prevent or detect security breaches, suchsecurity measures cannot provide absolute security and may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring, particularlygiven that techniques used to access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently, and any network and informationsystems-related events could require the Company to expend significant resources to remedy such event. Moreover, the developmentand maintenance of these measures is costly and requires ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts toovercome security measures become more sophisticated. While the Company maintains cyber risk insurance, this insurance may notbe sufficient to cover all losses from any future breaches of our systems. A significant failure, compromise, breach or interruption of theCompany’s systems, or those of third parties upon which its business relies, could result in a disruption of its operations,customer, audience or advertiser dissatisfaction, damage to its reputation or brands, regulatory investigations and enforcementactions, lawsuits, remediation costs, a loss of customers, advertisers or revenues and other financial losses. If any such failure,interruption or similar event results in the improper disclosure of information maintained in the Company’s information systemsand networks or those of its vendors, including financial, personal, credit card, confidential and proprietary information relatingto personnel, customers, vendors and the Company’s business, including its intellectual property, the Company could alsobe subject to liability under relevant contractual obligations and laws and regulations protecting personal data and privacy. Inaddition, media or other reports of perceived security vulnerabilities to our systems or those of third parties upon which theCompany’s business relies, even if nothing has actually been attempted or occurred, could also adversely impact our brandand reputation and materially affect our business. Risks relating to our Intellectual Property and RegulatoryApproval Protecting our proprietary rights is difficult and costly. Ifwe fail to adequately protect or enforce our proprietary rights, we could lose potential revenue from licensing and royalties. Our potential revenue and success depends in large part on our abilityto obtain, maintain and enforce our patents. Our ability to commercialize any product successfully will largely depend on our abilityto obtain and maintain patents of sufficient scope to prevent third parties from developing similar or competitive products. Inthe absence of patent protection, competitors may impact our business by developing and marketing substantially equivalent productsand technology. Patent disputes are frequent and can preclude the commercializationof products. We have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be, involved in material patent litigation, such asthe matters discussed under “Part I - Item 3. Legal Proceedings” in this report. Patent protection litigation is time-consumingand we have incurred and anticipate continuing to incur significant legal costs. In addition, an adverse decision could force usto either obtain third-party licenses at a material cost or cease using the technology or product in dispute. We have filed applications for United States and foreign patentscovering certain aspects of our technology, but there is no assurance that pending patents will issue or as to the degree of protectionwhich any issued patent might afford. Lawsuits, including patent infringements, in the biotechnologyindustry are not uncommon. If we become involved in any significant litigation, we would suffer as a result of the diversion ofour management’s attention, the expense of litigation and any judgments against us. In addition to intellectual property litigation for infringement,other substantial, complex or extended litigation could result in large expenditures by us and distraction of our management. Patentlitigation is time-consuming and costly in its own right and could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties. In addition,an adverse decision could force us to either obtain third-party licenses at a material cost or cease using the technology or productin dispute. In addition, lawsuits by employees, stockholders, collaborators or distributors could be very costly and substantiallydisrupt our business. Disputes from time to time with companies or individuals are not uncommon in the biotechnology industry,and we cannot assure you that we will always be able to resolve them out of court. We also utilize certain unpatented proprietary technology and noassurance can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary technology, that such proprietarytechnology will not be disclosed or that we can meaningfully protect our rights to such proprietary technology.27Our businessis subject to governmental laws and regulations. Changes in the way the FDA regulates the reagents, and other consumableswe use when developing, validating, and performing our tests could result in delay or additional expense in bringing our teststo market or performing such tests for our customers. We may be unable to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals for ourproducts, which could reduce our revenue or prevent us from earning a return on our research and development expenditures. Our research, preclinical development, clinical trials, productmanufacturing and marketing are subject to regulation by the FDA and similar health authorities in foreign countries. FDA approvalis required for our products, as well as the manufacturing processes and facilities, if any, used to produce our products thatmay be sold in the United States. The process of obtaining approvals from the FDA is costly, time consuming and often subject tounanticipated delays. Even if regulatory approval is granted, such approval may include significant limitations on indicated usesfor which any products could be marketed. Further, even if such regulatory approvals are obtained, a marketed product and its manufacturerare subject to continued review, and later discovery of previously unknown problems may result in restrictions on such productor manufacturer, including withdrawal of the product from the market. New government regulations in the United States or foreign countriesalso may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development. Further, because genetherapy is a relatively new technology and has not been extensively tested in humans, the regulatory requirements governing genetherapy products are uncertain and may be subject to substantial further review by various regulatory authorities in the UnitedStates and abroad. This uncertainty may result in extensive delays in initiating clinical trials and in the regulatory approvalprocess. Our failure to obtain regulatory approval of our proposed products, processes or facilities could have a material adverseeffect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The proposed products under development may also be subjectto certain other federal, state and local government regulations, including, but not limited to, the Federal Food, Drug and CosmeticAct, the Environmental Protection Act, and Occupational Safety and Health Act, and state, local and foreign counterparts to certainof such acts. In November 2013 the FDA issued a Guidancedocument entitled “Distribution of In Vitro Diagnostic Products Labeled for Research Use Only or Investigational UseOnly,” or the RUO Guidance, which highlights the FDA’s interpretation that distribution of RUO products with any labeling,advertising or promotion that suggests that clinical laboratories can validate the test through their own procedures and subsequentlyoffer it for clinical diagnostic use as an LDT is in conflict with RUO status. The RUO Guidance further articulates the FDA’s positionthat any assistance offered in performing clinical validation or verification, or similar specialized technical support, to clinicallaboratories, is in conflict with RUO status. More recently, on October 3, 2014, the FDA announced the availability of a draftguidance entitled “Framework for Regulatory Oversight of Laboratory-Developed Tests,” a risk-based oversight frameworkfor LDTs. If the draft guidance is finalized as presently written, such oversight framework includes a premarket review for higher-riskLDTs, such as those that have the same intended use as an FDA-approved or cleared companion diagnostic currently on the market,as well as other high risk and moderate risk LDTs over time. As a result of the draft guidance, we may be required to seek clearanceor approval to offer our tests for clinical use earlier than we otherwise might have done. If we engage in any activities thatare in conflict with the RUO status held by some of the tests that we sell or intend to sell, we may be subject to immediate, severeand broad FDA enforcement action that would adversely affect our ability to continue operations. Accordingly, if the FDA findsthat we are distributing our RUO products in a manner that is inconsistent with its guidance, we may be forced to stop distributionof our RUO tests until we are in compliance, which, would reduce our revenue, increase our costs and adversely affect our business,prospects, results of operations and financial condition. We cannot be sure that we can obtain necessary regulatory approvalson a timely basis, if at all, for any of the products we are developing or manufacturing or that we can maintain necessary regulatoryapprovals for our existing products, and all of the following could have a material adverse effect on our business: •significant delays in obtaining or failing to obtain required approvals;  •loss of, or changes to, previously obtained approvals;  •failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements and;  •changes to manufacturing processes, manufacturing process standards or Good Manufacturing Practices following approval or changing interpretations of these factors. Adverse perception and increased regulatory scrutiny of genemedicine and genetic research might limit our ability to conduct our business. Ethical, social and legal concerns about gene medicine, genetictesting and genetic research could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting the technologies we or our collaboratorsmay use. Recently, gene medicine studies have come under increasing scrutiny, which has delayed on-going and could delay futureclinical trials and regulatory approvals. Federal and state28agencies, congressional committees and foreigngovernments have expressed interest in further regulating biotechnology. More restrictive regulations or claims that our productsare unsafe or pose a hazard could prevent us from commercializing any products. Financial Risks With the exception of 2016, we have experienced significant lossesin our previous five fiscal years and quarter to quarter over such periods and our losses have resulted in the use of cash in operations.If such losses and cash uses continue, the value of your investment could decline significantly. Although for fiscal year 2016, we reported net income of $45.3 million,we incurred net losses of $2.5 million and $2.3 million for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2017 and 2015. If our revenues do notincrease, or if our operating expenses exceed expectations or cannot be reduced, we will continue to suffer substantial lossesand use cash in operations which could have an adverse effect on our business and adversely affect your investment in our Company. We may need additional capital to fund growth, which may notbe available on acceptable terms or at all, and could result in our business plan being limited and our business being harmed. Our ability to increase revenue and improve profitability and liquiditywill depend in part on our ability to grow the Enzo Life Science business with higher margin products and increase our market shareand continue to grow the Enzo Clinical Lab business with new tests with higher reimbursements and increase our service volume whichmay require significant additional capital that may not be available to us. We may need additional financing due to future developments,changes in our business plan or failure of our current business plan to succeed, which could result from increased marketing, distributionor research and development costs. Our actual funding requirements could vary materially from our current estimates. If additionalfinancing is needed, we may not be able to raise sufficient funds on favourable terms or at all. If we issue common stock or securitiesconvertible into common stock in the future, such issuance will result in the then-existing stockholders sustaining dilution totheir relative proportion of our outstanding equity. If we fail to obtain any necessary financing on a timely basis, then our abilityto execute our current business plan may be limited, and our business, liquidity and financial condition could be harmed. We may incur impairment charges on our goodwill and intangibleswhich would reduce our earnings. We are subject to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ASC350, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (“ASC 350”) which requires that goodwill and other intangible assets thathave an indefinite life be tested at least annually for impairment. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite livesmust also be tested for impairment between the annual tests if a triggering event occurs that would likely reduce the fair valueof the asset below its carrying amount. As of July 31, 2017 and 2016, goodwill and intangible assets representedapproximately 10% and 11%, respectively, of our total assets. If we determine that there has been impairment, our financial resultsfor the relevant period would be reduced by the amount of the impairment, net of tax effects, if any. The Company has no intangibleassets with indefinite lives. Risks relating to our Clinical Labs segment Our clinical laboratory business is subject to extensive governmentregulation and our loss of any required certifications or licenses could require us to cease operating this part of our business,which would reduce our revenue and injure our reputation. The clinical laboratory industryis subject to significant governmental regulation at the Federal, state and local levels. Under the Clinical Laboratory ImprovementAct of 1967 and the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (collectively, as amended, “CLIA”) virtuallyall clinical laboratories, including ours, must be certified by the Federal government. Many clinical laboratories also must meetother governmental standards, undergo proficiency testing and are subject to inspection. Certifications or licenses are also requiredby various state and local laws. The failure of our clinical laboratory to obtain or maintain such certifications or licenses underthese laws could interrupt our ability to operate our clinical laboratory business and injure our reputation. The Protecting Access to Medicare Act (“PAMA”) of 2014includes a substantial new payment system for clinical laboratory tests under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, or CLFS andwill impact the clinical laboratory testing industry. Key parts of this legislationinclude provisions that provide for the establishment of an advisory panel and a market-based process to rebase the clinical laboratoryfee schedule, developing a new fee schedule and limiting reductions in that fee schedule. If this process does not recognize thevalue that clinical laboratory testing brings to the healthcare system, our business can be materially adversely impacted.29Reimbursements from third-party payers including managed careorganizations and Medicare, upon which our clinical laboratory business is dependent, are subject to inconsistent rates and coverageand legislative reform that are beyond our control. This inconsistency and any reform that decreases coverage and rates could reduceour earnings and harm our business. Our clinical laboratory business is primarily dependent upon reimbursementfrom third-party payers, such as Medicaid, Medicare (which principally serves patients 65 and older) and commercial insurers. Weare subject to variances in reimbursement rates among different third-party payers, as well as constant renegotiation of thosereimbursement rates. Government and non-government payers have in the past sought, and continue to seek,to reduce and limit utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services, including the areas of clinical and genetic testing.We also are subject to audit by Medicare and the commercial insurers, which can result in the return of payments made tous under these programs. These variances in reimbursement rates and audit results could reduce our margins and thus our earnings. The health care industry continues to undergo significant changeas third-party payers’ increase their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of health care services. In aneffort to address the problem of increasing health care costs, legislation has been proposed or enacted at both the Federal andstate levels to regulate health care delivery in general and clinical laboratories in particular. Some of the proposals includemanaged competition, global budgeting and price controls. Changes that decrease reimbursement rates or coverage, or increase administrativeburdens on billing third-party payers could reduce our revenues and increase our expenses. Since each payer makes its own decision as to whether to establisha policy or enter into a contract to cover our tests, as well as the amount it will reimburse for a test, seeking these approvalsis a time-consuming and costly process. In addition, the determination by a payer to cover and the amount it will reimburse forour tests will likely be made on an indication by indication basis. To date, we have obtained policy-level reimbursement approvalor contractual reimbursement for some indications for our test from a small number of commercial third-party payers, and have notobtained coverage from Medicare or any state Medicaid program. Further, we believe that establishing adequate reimbursement fromMedicare is an important factor in gaining adoption from healthcare providers. Our claims for reimbursement from commercial payersmay be denied upon submission, and we must appeal the claims. The appeals process is time consuming and expensive, and may notresult in payment. In cases where there is not a contracted rate for reimbursement, there is typically a greater co-insurance orco-payment requirement from the patient which may result in further delay or decreased likelihood of collection. We expect to continue to focus substantial resources on increasingadoption of, and coverage and reimbursement for, our current tests and any future tests we may develop. We believe it may takeseveral years to achieve coverage and adequate contracted reimbursement with a majority of third-party payers. However, we cannotpredict whether, under what circumstances, or at what payment levels payers will reimburse for our tests. If we fail to establishand maintain broad adoption of, and coverage and reimbursement for, our tests, our ability to generate revenue could be harmedand our future prospects and our business could suffer. U.S. healthcare reform legislation may result in significantchange and our business could be adversely impacted if we fail to adapt. Government oversight of and attention to the healthcare industryin the United States is significant and increasing. Under the Patient Protections and affordable Care Act, expansion in the poolof covered lives may expand the market for clinical diagnostic testing while at the same time, various policies aimed at reducingcosts or bundling care may reduce the rates paid for such services’ the net impact of these factors on the market for ourtests is not clear. In April 2014, Congress passed the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, which include substantial changesto the way in which clinical laboratory services will be paid under Medicare. Beginning on January 1, 2018, Medicare payments forclinical laboratory services will be paid based upon private payer rates reported by clinical laboratories across the US replacingthe current system, which is based upon fee schedules derived from historical charges for test from approximately 30 years ago.The impact of the new payment system on rates for tests we perform or our customers’ tests that may use our products is notclear at this time. The updated CMS rates will be phased in over six years starting January 1, 2018. Reductions are scheduled forthe first three years at 10% and 15% for the remaining three years on select tests. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act also imposes an excisetax on the seller for the sale of certain medical devices in the United States, including those purchased and used by laboratories,beginning in 2013. The legislation also establishes the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which will be responsible, beginningin 2014, annually to submit proposals aimed at reducing Medicare cost growth while preserving quality. If the projected growthin per capita Medicare costs exceeds a specified target level, the IPAB must submit proposals to reduce or eliminate the difference.For calendar years 2015 through 2019, the target growth rate is the projected average of the increases in the Consumer Price Indexand the medical care expenditure category of the Consumer Price Index; for 2020 and thereafter, the target growth rate is the rateof increase in gross domestic product per capita plus one percentage point. If it is necessary for the IPAB to submit proposals,they will automatically be implemented unless Congress enacts alternative proposals that achieve the same savings targets.30Further, the legislation calls for a Center for Medicare and MedicaidInnovation that will examine alternative payment methodologies and conduct demonstration programs. The legislation provides forextensive health insurance reforms, including the elimination of pre-existing condition exclusions and other limitations on coverage,fixed percentages on medical loss ratios, expansion in Medicaid and other programs, employer mandates, individual mandates, creationof state and regional health insurance exchanges, and tax subsidies for individuals to help cover the cost of individual insurancecoverage. The legislation also permits the establishment of accountable care organizations, a new healthcare delivery model. Whilethe ultimate impact of the legislation on the healthcare industry is unknown, it is likely to be extensive and may result in significantchange. Our failure to adapt to these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business. Changes in provider mix, including continued growth in capitatedmanaged-cost health care and changes in certain third party provider agreements could have a material adverse impact on the Company’snet revenues and profitability. Certain third party provider companies have adopted national andregional programs which include multiple managed-care reimbursement models. If the Company is unable to participate in these programsor if the Company would lose a material contract, it could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s net revenues andprofitability. The number of individuals covered under managed care contracts orother similar arrangements has grown over the past several years and may continue to grow in the future. In addition, Medicareand other government healthcare programs may continue to shift to managed care. Entities providing managed care coverage have reducedpayments for medical services, including clinical laboratory services, in numerous ways such as entering into arrangements underwhich payments to a service provider are capitated, limiting testing to specified procedures, denying payment for services performedwithout prior authorization and refusing to increase fees for specified services. These trends reduce our revenues and limit ourability to pass cost increases to our customers. Also, if these or other managed care organizations do not select us as a participatingprovider, we may lose some or all of that business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition andresults of operations. Because of competitive pressures, impacts of the economy on patientvisits to our customer physician locations and the complexity and expense of the billing process in our clinical laboratory business,we must obtain new customers while maintaining existing customers to grow our business. Intense competition in the clinical laboratory business, increasingadministrative burdens upon the reimbursement process, reduced patient traffic, and reduced coverage and payments by insurers makeit necessary for us to increase our volume of laboratory services. To do so, we must obtain new customers while retaining existingcustomers. Our failure to attract new customers or the loss of existing customersor a reduction in business from those customers could significantly reduce our revenues and impede our ability to grow. Compliance with Medicare administrative policies, including thosepertaining to certain automated blood chemistry profiles, may reduce the reimbursements we receive. Containment of health care costs, including reimbursement for clinicallaboratory services, has been a focus of on-going governmental activity. Clinical laboratories must bill Medicare directly forthe services provided to Medicare beneficiaries and may only collect the amounts permitted under this fee schedule. Reimbursementto clinical laboratories under the Medicare Fee Schedule has been steadily declining since its inception. Because a significantportion of our costs is fixed, these Medicare reimbursement reductions and changes have a direct adverse effect on our net earningsand cash flows. The development of new, more cost-effective tests that can beperformed by our customers or by patients, and the continued internalization of testing by hospitals or physicians, could negativelyimpact our testing volume and revenues. The diagnostic industry is faced with changing technology and newproduct introductions, including technology that enables more convenient or cost-effective testing. Some of our competitors alsomay offer testing to be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory, such as point-of-care testing that can be performedby physicians in their offices; complex testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories; and home testingthat can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers. Advances in technology also may lead to the need for less frequenttesting. Further, diagnostic tests approved or cleared by the FDA for home use are automatically deemed to be “waived”tests under CLIA and may be performed by patients in their homes; test kit manufacturers could seek to increase sales to patientsof such test kits. Development of such technology and its use by our customers would reduce the demand for our laboratory-basedtesting services and negatively impact our revenues.31Our business could be harmed from the loss or suspension of alicense or imposition of a fine or penalties under, or future changes in, or changing interpretations of, CLIA or state laboratorylicensing laws to which we are subject. The clinical laboratory testing industry is subject to extensivefederal and state regulation, and many of these statutes and regulations have not been interpreted by the courts. The ClinicalLaboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA, are federal regulatory standards that apply to virtually all clinical laboratories(regardless of the location, size or type of laboratory), including those operated by physicians in their offices, by requiringthat they be certified by the federal government or by a federally approved accreditation agency. CLIA does not pre-empt statelaw, which in some cases may be more stringent than federal law and require additional personnel qualifications, quality control,record maintenance and proficiency testing. The sanction for failure to comply with CLIA and state requirements may be suspension,revocation or limitation of a laboratory’s CLIA certificate, which is necessary to conduct business, as well as significantfines and/or criminal penalties. Several states have similar laws and we may be subject to similar penalties. We cannot assure that applicable statutes and regulations will notbe interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely affect our business.Potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include significant fines and the suspension or loss of variouslicenses, certificates and authorizations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, compliancewith future legislation could impose additional requirements on us, which may be costly. Regulations requiring the use of “standard transactions”for healthcare services may negatively impact our profitability and cash flows. The administrative simplification provisions of the Health InsurancePortability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its implementing regulations, or HIPAA, were designed to improve the efficiencyand effectiveness of the healthcare system by facilitating the electronic exchange of information in certain financial and administrativetransactions while protecting the privacy and security of the information exchanged. The administrative simplification provisionsaddress standards for electronic transactions, security regulations and privacy regulations. The HIPAA transaction standards are complex, and subject to differencesin interpretation by payers. For instance, some payers may interpret the standards to require us to provide certain types of information,including demographic information not usually provided to us by physicians. While most of our transactions are submitted and/orreceived in ANSI standard format, inconsistent application of transaction standards by some remaining payers or our inability toobtain certain billing information not usually provided to us by physicians could increase our costs and the complexity of billing.In addition, new requirements for additional standard transactions, such as claims attachments, could prove technically difficult,time-consuming or expensive to implement. We are working closely with our payers to establish acceptable protocols for claims submissionsand with our industry trade association and an industry coalition to present issues and problems as they arise to the appropriateregulators and standards setting organizations. Our business could be adversely impacted by adoption of new codingsets for diagnoses. CMS adopted a new coding set for diagnosis, commonly known as ICD-10,which significantly expanded the coding set for diagnoses. We implemented the coding set by the October 1, 2015 deadline. The adoptionof new coding sets can lead to limited coverage decisions, payment delays or denials, or new procedures or conditions for payments.We cannot predict the impact on our business if in the future new coding sets were to be adopted Compliance with the HIPAA security, privacy and breach notificationregulations and privacy regulations may increase our costs. The HIPAA privacy and security and breach notification regulationsestablish comprehensive federal standards with respect to the uses and disclosures PHI by Covered Entities. These regulations wererecently amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, orHITECH, to, among other things directly apply to business associates (i.e., individuals or entities who create, receive, maintainor transmit PHI on behalf of a Covered Entity in performing functions or activities regulated by HIPAA or who perform certain services,other than treatment, on behalf of Covered Entities and receive PHI in order to perform such services) with regard to certain requirements.The regulations also specify that business associates include subcontractors that create, receive, maintain or transmit PHI onbehalf of a business associate. The regulations establish a complex regulatory framework on a variety of subjects, including:  §the circumstances under which uses and disclosures of PHI are permitted or required without a specific authorization by the patient, including but not limited to treatment purposes, activities to obtain payments for our services, and our healthcare operations activities;32 §a patient’s rights to access, amend and receive an accounting of certain disclosures of PHI;    §requirements to notify individuals if there is a breach of their PHI;    §the requirements for business associates and the terms of business associate agreements;    §the content of notices of privacy practices for protected health information and;    §administrative, technical and physical safeguards required of entities that use or receive PHI. We have implemented practices to meet the requirements of the HIPAAprivacy, security and breach notification regulations, and updated these practices to comply with HITECH. HIPAA establishes a “floor”and does not supersede state laws that are more stringent. Therefore, we are required to comply with federal privacy security andbreach notification regulations and varying state privacy, security and breach notification laws and regulations. In addition,for healthcare data transfers from other countries relating to citizens of those countries, we must comply with the laws of thoseother countries. The federal privacy regulations restrict our ability to use or disclose patient-identifiable laboratory data,without patient authorization, for purposes other than payment, treatment, healthcare operations and certain other specified disclosuressuch as public health and governmental oversight of the health care industry. The privacy, security and breach notification regulationsprovide for significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of PHI, including potential civil and criminalfines and penalties. Although the HIPAA statute and regulations do not expressly provide for a private right of damages, we alsocould incur damages under state laws to private parties for the wrongful use or disclosure of confidential health information orother private personal information. Compliance with all of the HIPAA regulations, including standardtransactions, requires on-going resources from all healthcare organizations, not just clinical laboratories. While we believe ourtotal costs to comply with HIPAA will not be material to our operations or cash flows, new standard transactions and additionalcustomer requirements resulting from different interpretations of the current regulations could impose additional costs on us. FDA regulation of laboratory-developed tests, analyte specificreagents, or genetic testing could lead to increased costs and delays in introducing new genetic tests. The FDA has regulatory responsibility over, among other areas, instruments,test kits, reagents and other devices used by clinical laboratories to perform diagnostic testing in the U.S. A number of testswe develop internally are offered as lab developed tests (LDTs). The FDA has claimed regulatory authority over all LDTs, but hasstated that it exercised enforcement discretion with regard to most LDTs performed by high complexity CLIA-certified laboratories.The FDA has published a ""Discussion Document"" that provides the FDA's views on legislation to govern LDTs. New legislationcould significantly impact the clinical laboratory testing business, including by increasing or modifying the regulation of LDTs,hindering our ability to develop and market new services, causing an increase in the cost of our services, delaying our abilityto introduce new tests or hindering our ability to perform testing. We are subject to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuseand other laws and regulations and could face substantial penalties if we are unable to fully comply with such laws. As a provider of clinical laboratory testing services, we are subjectto extensive and frequently changing federal, state and local laws and regulations governing various aspects of our business. Forexample, we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by both the federal government and the statesin which we conduct our business. These healthcare laws and regulations include, for example: §the federal Anti-Kickback Law, which constrains our marketing practices,educational programs, pricing policies, and relationships with healthcare providers or other entities, including third-party laboratories,by prohibiting, among other things, persons or entities from soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directlyor indirectly, in return for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease order or recommendationof, any good, facility, item or services for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare programsuch as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; §federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penaltylaws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claimsfor payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent, and which may apply to entities likeus to the extent that our interactions with customers may affect their billing or coding practices; §the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of1996, as amended, or HIPAA, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individuallyidentifiable health information, and also established federal crimes for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraudany healthcare benefit program or33making false statements in connectionwith the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services, and which imposed certain requirements relating toprivacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information; §the federal physician self-referral law, commonly known as the StarkLaw, which prohibits a physician from making a referral to an entity for certain designated health services reimbursed by Medicareor Medicaid if the physician (or a member of the physician’s family) has a financial relationship with the entity, and whichalso prohibits the submission of any claims for reimbursement for designated health services furnished pursuant to a prohibitedreferral; §the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, and its implementing regulations,which requires manufacturers of certain drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare,Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the United States Departmentof Health and Human Services information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to includedoctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interestsheld by physicians and their immediate family members; §federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadlyregulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers; and §state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickbackand false claims laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurersand state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from eachother in significant ways, with differing effects. We are unable to predict what additional federal or state legislationor regulatory initiatives may be enacted in the future regarding our business or the healthcare industry in general, or what effectsuch legislation or regulations may have on us. Federal or state governments may impose additional restrictions or adopt interpretationsof existing laws that could have an adverse effect on us. We incur significant costs in complying with these laws and regulations.Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that someof our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations, or our sales techniquesor product placement strategies, are found to be in violation of, or to encourage or assist the violation by third parties of,any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, or if we fail to maintain, renew or obtainnecessary permits, licenses and approvals related to our in-house laboratory, we may be subject to penalties, including civil andcriminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputationalharm, diminished profits and future earnings, suspension or revocation of certifications or licenses that are required to operateour business, injunctions and other associated remedies, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, denial or withdrawalof product clearances, or private ""qui tam"" actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government,any of which could have an adverse effect on our business. If we or others determine that any of our existing customer relationshipsdo not comply with applicable laws and regulations, either due to changes in such laws and regulations or evolving interpretationsof such laws and regulations, we may be required to renegotiate or terminate such relationships. Any penalties, damages, fines,exclusions, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financialresults. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of these laws are broad andtheir provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfullydefend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operationof our business. Other risks relating to our business If we fail to maintain or monitor our information systems ourbusinesses could be adversely affected. We depend on information systems throughout our Company to controlour Life Science manufacturing, inventory, distribution and website and the Clinical Lab processes for: processing specimens, managinginventory, processing test results and submitting claims, collecting from insurers and patients, responding to inquiries, contributingto our overall internal control processes, maintaining records of our property, plant and equipment, and recording and paying amountsdue vendors and other creditors. If we were to experience a prolonged disruption in our information systems that involve interactionswith customers and suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and/or increased costs, which could adverselyaffect our business. Cyber security risks and the failure tomaintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our computer hardware, software, and Internet applications and relatedtools and functions could result in damage to the Company’s reputation and/or subject the Company to costs, fines, or lawsuits.34The integrity and protection of our owndata, and that of its customers and employees, is critical to the Company’s business. The regulatory environment governinginformation, security and privacy laws is increasingly demanding and continues to evolve. Maintaining compliance with applicablesecurity and privacy regulations may increase the Company’s operating costs and/or adversely impact the Company’s abilityto market its products and services to customers. Although the Company’s computer and communications hardware is protectedthrough physical and software safeguards, it is still vulnerable to fire, storm, flood, power loss, earthquakes, telecommunicationsfailures, physical or software break-ins, software viruses, and similar events. These events could lead to the unauthorized access,disclosure and use of non-public information. The techniques used by criminal elements to attack computer systems are sophisticated,change frequently and may originate from less regulated and remote areas of the world. As a result, the Company may not be ableto address these techniques proactively or implement adequate preventative measures. If the Company’s computer systems arecompromised, it could be subject to fines, damages, litigation, and enforcement actions, customers could curtail or cease usingits applications, and the Company could lose trade secrets, the occurrence of which could harm its business. If we fail to attract and retain key personnel, including oursenior management, our business could be adversely affected. Most of our products and services are highly technical in nature.In general, only highly qualified and trained scientists and technician personnel have the necessary skills to develop proprietarytechnological products and market our products, support our research and development programs and provide our Clinical Lab services. In addition, some of our manufacturing, quality control, safetyand compliance, information technology and e-commerce related positions are highly technical as well. Further, our sales personnelhighly trained and are important to retaining and growing our businesses. Our success depends in large part upon our ability toidentify, hire, retain and motivate highly skilled professionals. We face intense competition for these professionals from our competitors,customers, marketing partners and other companies throughout the industries in which we compete. Since our inception we have successfullyrecruited and hired qualified key employees. Any failure on our part to hire, train, and retain a sufficient number of qualifiedprofessionals would seriously damage our business. We depend heavily on the services of our senior management. We believethat our future success depends on the continued services of such management. Our business may be harmed by the loss of a significantnumber of our senior management in a short period of time. The insurance we purchase to cover our potential business riskmay be inadequate. Although we believe that our present insurance coverage is sufficientto cover our current estimated exposures, we cannot assure that we will not incur losses or liabilities in excess of our policylimits. In addition, although we believe that will be able to continue to obtain adequate coverage, we cannot assure that we willbe able to do so at acceptable costs. Risks relating to our international operations Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affectour business. Since we operate as a multinational corporation that sells and sourcesproducts in many different countries, changes in exchange rates could in the future, adversely affect our cash flows and resultsof operations. Furthermore, reported sales and purchases made in non-U.S. currenciesby our international businesses, when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes, fluctuate due to exchangerate movement. Due to the number of currencies involved, the variability of currency exposures and the potential volatility ofcurrency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on future sales and operating results. We are subject to economic, political and other risks associatedwith our significant international business, which could adversely affect our financial results. We operate internationally primarily through wholly-owned subsidiarieslocated in North America and Europe. Revenues outside the United States were approximately 8% of total revenues in fiscal 2017.Our sales and earnings could be adversely affected by a variety of factors resulting from our international operations, including •future fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;  •complex regulatory requirements and changes in those requirements;  •trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;35•multiple jurisdictions and differing tax laws, as well as changes in those laws;  •restrictions on our ability to repatriate investments and earnings from foreign operations;  •changes in the political or economic conditions in a country or region, particularly in developing or emerging markets;  •changes in shipping costs; and  •difficulties in collecting on accounts receivable. If any of these risks materialize, we could face substantial increasesin costs, the reduction of profit and the inability to do business. As we expand our commercialization activities outside of theUnited States, we will be subject to an increased risk of inadvertently conducting activities in a manner that violates the U.S.Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws. If that occurs, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties which could havea material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”),which prohibits corporations and individuals from paying, offering to pay, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to anyforeign government official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retainbusiness or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. We are also subject to the UK Anti-Bribery Act, whichprohibits both domestic and international bribery, as well as bribery across both public and private sectors. In the course of establishing and expanding our commercial operationsand seeking regulatory approvals outside of the United States, we will need to establish and expand business relationships withvarious third parties and we will interact more frequently with foreign officials, including regulatory authorities. Expanded programsto maintain compliance with such laws will be costly and may not be effective. Any interactions with any such parties or individualswhere compensation is provided that are found to be in violation of such laws could result in substantial fines and penalties andcould materially harm our business. Furthermore, any finding of a violation under one country’s laws may increase the likelihoodthat we will be prosecuted and be found to have violated another country’s laws. If our business practices outside the UnitedStates are found to be in violation of the FCPA, UK Anti-Bribery Act or other similar law, we may be subject to significant civiland criminal penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Risks Relating to our Common Stock Our stock price has been volatile, which could result in substantiallosses for investors. Our common stock is quoted on the New York Stock Exchange, and therehas been historical volatility in the market price of our common stock. The trading price of our common stock has been, and islikely to continue to be, subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors, including: •fluctuations in our quarterly operating and earnings per share results;  •the gain or loss of significant contracts;  •the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets;  •loss of key personnel;  •announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors;  •delays in the development and introduction of new products;  •legislative or regulatory changes;  •general trends in the industries we operate;  •recommendations and/or changes in estimates by equity and market research analysts;36•biological or medical discoveries;  •disputes and/or developments concerning intellectual property, including patents and litigation    matters;  •public concern as to the safety of new technologies;  •sales of common stock of existing holders;  •securities class action or other litigation;  •developments in our relationships with current or future customers and suppliers and;  •general economic conditions, both in the United States and worldwide. In addition, the stock market in general has experienced extremeprice and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of our common stock, as well as the stock of many companies inour industries. Often, price fluctuations are unrelated to operating performance of the specific companies whose stock is affected. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market priceof a company’s stock, securities class action litigation has occurred against the issuing company. If we were subject tothis type of litigation in the future, we could incur substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention andresources, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings. Any adverse determination in this typeof litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities. Because we do not intend to pay cash dividends on our commonstock, an investor in our common stock will benefit only if it appreciates in value. We currently intend to retain our retained earnings and future earnings,if any, to finance the expansion of our business and do not expect to pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeablefuture. As a result, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon any future appreciation. Thereis no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which investors purchased their shares. It may be difficult for a third party to acquire us, which couldinhibit stockholders from realizing a premium on their stock price. We are subject to the New York anti-takeoverlaws regulating corporate takeovers. These anti-takeover laws prohibit certain business combinations between a New York corporationand any “interested shareholder” (generally, the beneficial owner of 20% or more of the corporation’s votingshares) for five years following the time that the shareholder became an interested shareholder, unless the corporation’sboard of directors approved the transaction prior to the interested shareholder becoming interested. Our certificate of incorporation, as amended, and by-laws containprovisions that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us that stockholders may considerfavorable or beneficial. These provisions could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to electdirectors and take other corporate actions. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to payin the future for shares of our common stock. These provisions include: •a staggered board of directors, so that it would take three successive    annual meetings to replace all directors; and  •advance notice requirements for the submission by stockholders of nominations for election    to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting. Future sales of shares of our common stock or the issuance ofsecurities senior to our common stock could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our ability to raise fundsin new equity offerings. We are not restricted from issuing additional common stock, preferredstock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock. Future sales of a substantial number of our shares of commonstock or equity-related securities in the public market or privately, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adverselyaffect prevailing trading prices of our common stock, and could impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings ofequity or equity-related securities. No prediction can be made as to the effect, if any, that future sales of shares of commonstock or the availability of shares of common stock for future sale will have on the trading price of our common stock.37"
8,ENZ,ENZO BIOCHEM INC,2016-10-13,"Risk Factors
 Business Risks Our operating results may vary from period to period. Our operating results may vary significantly from quarter toquarter and from year to year, depending on a variety of factors including: •competitive conditions, including changes in third-party reimbursements;  •health care reform regulations affecting providers and plan sponsors;  •changes in reimbursement policies from third party payers;  •exchange rate fluctuations;  •changes in tax laws, the results of tax audits or the measurement of tax uncertainties;  •the timing of our research and development, sales and marketing expenses;  •the introduction of new products by us or our competitors;  •the success of identifying, acquiring and integrating businesses that complement our product offerings, add new technology or add presence in a market;  •expenses associated with defending our intellectual property portfolio;  •customer demand for our products due to changes in purchasing requirements and research needs;  •general worldwide economic conditions affecting funding of research; and  •seasonal fluctuations affected by weather and holiday periods. Consequently, results for any interim period may not necessarilybe indicative of results in subsequent periods. A significant proportion of our sales are to academic centers,funded by government grants in our major markets globally. Governments around the world have been reviewing long term publicfunding of life science research in response to the problems arising from global financial pressures. As a result, the availablefunds for discretionary purchases from market to market have been capped or reduced based on available National budgets. Reducedgrants for researchers could impact our business, in the amount, price and type of products bought and used by customers. A significant proportion of our sales are to customers inpharmaceutical and biotech companies. Globally, pharmaceutical companies are challenging internalbudgets, and the return of investment from their R&D spend. This could impact our business, in the amount, price and type ofproducts bought and used by customers. Our future success will depend in part upon our ability toenhance existing products, develop and introduce new products and realize commercial acceptance of those products, in a rapidlychanging technological environment.24The market for our products is characterized by rapidly changingtechnology, evolving industry standards and new product introductions, which may make our existing products obsolete. Our futuresuccess will depend in part upon our ability to enhance existing products, develop and introduce new products, and realize commercialacceptance of those products The development of new or enhanced products is a complex anduncertain process requiring the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends as well as precise technological execution.In addition, the successful development of new products will depend on the development of new technologies. We will be requiredto undertake time-consuming and costly development activities and to seek regulatory approval for these new products. We may experiencedifficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of these new products. Regulatoryclearance or approval of any new products may not be granted by the FDA, state-wide agency or foreign regulatory authorities ona timely basis, or at all, and the new products may not be successfully commercialized. We may be unable to identify, acquire and integrate acquisitiontargets. Our strategy envisions, if an opportunistic target is identified,future growth from acquiring and integrating similar operations and/or product or services lines. There can be no assurance thatwe will be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates and, once identified, to negotiate successfully their acquisition ata price or on terms and conditions favorable to us, or to integrate the operations of such acquired businesses with the existingoperations. In addition, we compete for acquisition candidates with other entities, some of which have greater financial resourcesthan ours. Failure to implement successfully our acquisition strategy would limit our potential growth. Our inability to carry out certain of our marketing and salesplans may make it difficult for us to grow or maintain our business. The Life Sciences segment continues a marketing program designedto more directly service its end users, while simultaneously promoting the Enzo Life Science brand, with reference to our acquiredbrands. We will continue to reach out to our customers using our direct field sales force, in-house business team, the on-goingenhancement of our interactive websites, continued attendance at top industry trade meetings, and publications to customers andin leading scientific journals. In addition to our direct sales, we operate worldwide through wholly-owned subsidiaries (in USA,Switzerland, Belgium, Germany, and the UK), a branch office in France and a network of third-party distributors in most other significantmarkets. If we are unable to successfully continue these programs, we may be unable to grow and our business could suffer. We face significant competition, which could cause us todecrease the prices for our products or services or render our products uneconomical or obsolete, any of which could reduce ourrevenues and limit our growth. Our competitors in the biotechnology industry in the UnitedStates and abroad are numerous and include major pharmaceutical, energy, food and chemical companies, as well as specialized geneticengineering firms. Many of our large competitors have substantially greater resources than us and have the capability of developingproducts which compete directly with our products. Many of these companies are performing research in the same areas as we are.The markets for our products are also subject to competitive risks because markets are highly price competitive. Our competitorshave competed in the past by lowering prices on certain products. The clinical laboratory business is highly fragmented and intenselycompetitive, and we compete with numerous national and local companies. Some of these entities are larger than we are and havegreater resources than we do. We compete primarily on the basis of the quality of our testing, reporting and information services,our reputation in the medical community, the pricing of our services and our ability to employ qualified professionals. These competitive conditions could, among other things: •Require us to reduce our prices to retain market share;  •Require us to increase our marketing efforts which could reduce our profit margins;  •Increase our cost of labor to attract qualified personnel;  •Render our biotechnology products uneconomical or obsolete or;  •Reduce our revenue. Ethical, legal and social concerns surrounding the use ofgenetic information could reduce demand for our products. Genetic testing has raised ethical issues regarding privacyand the appropriate uses of the resulting information. For these reasons, governmental authorities may call for limits on or regulationof the use of genetic testing or prohibit testing for genetic predisposition 25to certain conditions, particularly for those thathave no known cure. Similarly, such concerns may lead individuals to refuse to use genetics tests even if permissible. Any of thesescenarios could reduce the potential markets for our molecular diagnostic products, which could have a material adverse effecton our business, financial condition and results of operations. We depend on distributors and contract manufacturers andsuppliers for materials that could impair our ability to manufacture or distribute our products. Our Life Sciences segment manufactures and distributes our ownbrand products and the products of third party manufacturers and suppliers. Distributors also sell our branded products. To theextent we are unable to maintain or replace a distributor in a reasonable time period, or on commercially reasonable terms, ifat all, our operations could be disrupted. Outside distributors, suppliers and contract manufacturers providekey finished goods, components and raw materials used in the sale and manufacture of our products. Although we believe that alternativesources for components and raw materials are available, any supply interruption in a limited or sole source component or raw materialwould harm our ability to manufacture our products until a new source of supply is identified and qualified. In addition, an uncorrecteddefect or supplier’s variation in a component or raw material, either unknown to us or incompatible with our manufacturingprocess, could harm our ability to manufacture products. We might not be able to find a sufficient alternative supplier in a reasonabletime period, or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we fail to obtain a supplier for the components of our products,our operations could be disrupted. We use hazardous materials in our business. Any claims relatingto improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials could be costly and time-consuming. Our manufacturing, clinical laboratory and research and developmentprocesses involve the storage, use and disposal of hazardous substances, including hazardous chemicals, biological hazardous materialsand radioactive compounds. We are subject to governmental regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposalof materials and waste products. Although we believe that our safety and environmental management practices and procedures forhandling and disposing of these hazardous materials are in accordance with good industry practice and comply with applicable laws,permits, licenses and regulations, the risk of accidental environmental or human contamination or injury from the release or exposureof hazardous materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for any damages thatresult, including environmental clean-up or decontamination costs, and any such liability could exceed the limits of, or fall outsidethe coverage of, our insurance. We may not be able to maintain insurance on acceptable terms,or at all. We could be required to incur significant costs to comply with current or future environmental and public and workplacesafety and health laws and regulations. We are required to expend significant resources for researchand development for our products in development and these products may not be developed successfully. Failure to successfully developthese products may prevent us from earning a return on our research and development expenditures. The products we are developing are at various stages of developmentand clinical evaluations and may require further technical development and investment to determine whether commercial applicationis practicable. There can be no assurance that our efforts will result in products with valuable commercial applications. Our cashrequirements may vary materially from current estimates because of results of our research and development programs, competitiveand technological advances and other factors. In any event, we will require substantial funds to conduct development activitiesand pre-clinical and clinical trials, apply for regulatory approvals and commercialize products, if any, that are developed. We do not have any commitments or arrangements to obtain anyadditional financing and there is no assurance that required financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.Even if we spend substantial amounts on research and development, our potential products may not be developed successfully. If our product candidates on which we have expended significantamounts for research and development are not commercialized, we will not earn a return on our research and development expenditures,which may harm our business. Risks relating to our Intellectual Property and RegulatoryApproval Protecting our proprietary rights is difficult and costly.If we fail to adequately protect or enforce our proprietary rights, we could lose potential revenue from licensing and royalties. Our potential revenue and success depends in large part on ourability to obtain, maintain and enforce our patents. Our ability to commercialize any product successfully will largely dependon our ability to obtain and maintain patents of sufficient scope to prevent 26third parties from developing similar or competitiveproducts. In the absence of patent protection, competitors may impact our business by developing and marketing substantially equivalentproducts and technology. Patent disputes are frequent and can preclude the commercializationof products. We have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be, involved in material patent litigation, such asthe matters discussed under “Part I - Item 3. Legal Proceedings” in this report. Patent protection litigation is time-consumingand we have incurred and anticipate continuing to incur significant legal costs. In addition, an adverse decision could force usto either obtain third-party licenses at a material cost or cease using the technology or product in dispute. We have filed applications for United States and foreign patentscovering certain aspects of our technology, but there is no assurance that pending patents will issue or as to the degree of protectionwhich any issued patent might afford. Lawsuits, including patent infringements, in the biotechnologyindustry are not uncommon. If we become involved in any significant litigation, we would suffer as a result of the diversion ofour management’s attention, the expense of litigation and any judgments against us. In addition to intellectual property litigation for infringement,other substantial, complex or extended litigation could result in large expenditures by us and distraction of our management. Patentlitigation is time-consuming and costly in its own right and could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties. In addition,an adverse decision could force us to either obtain third-party licenses at a material cost or cease using the technology or productin dispute. In addition, lawsuits by employees, stockholders, collaborators or distributors could be very costly and substantiallydisrupt our business. Disputes from time to time with companies or individuals are not uncommon in the biotechnology industry,and we cannot assure you that we will always be able to resolve them out of court. We also utilize certain unpatented proprietary technology andno assurance can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary technology, that suchproprietary technology will not be disclosed or that we can meaningfully protect our rights to such proprietary technology. Our business is subject to governmentallaws and regulations. We may be unable to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals for our products, which could reduce our revenueor prevent us from earning a return on our research and development expenditures. Our research, preclinical development, clinical trials, productmanufacturing and marketing are subject to regulation by the FDA and similar health authorities in foreign countries. FDA approvalis required for our products, as well as the manufacturing processes and facilities, if any, used to produce our products thatmay be sold in the United States. The process of obtaining approvals from the FDA is costly, time consuming and often subject tounanticipated delays. Even if regulatory approval is granted, such approval may include significant limitations on indicated usesfor which any products could be marketed. Further, even if such regulatory approvals are obtained, a marketed product and its manufacturerare subject to continued review, and later discovery of previously unknown problems may result in restrictions on such productor manufacturer, including withdrawal of the product from the market. New government regulations in the United States or foreign countriesalso may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development. Further, because genetherapy is a relatively new technology and has not been extensively tested in humans, the regulatory requirements governing genetherapy products are uncertain and may be subject to substantial further review by various regulatory authorities in the UnitedStates and abroad. This uncertainty may result in extensive delays in initiating clinical trials and in the regulatory approvalprocess. Our failure to obtain regulatory approval of our proposed products, processes or facilities could have a material adverseeffect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The proposed products under development may also be subjectto certain other federal, state and local government regulations, including, but not limited to, the Federal Food, Drug and CosmeticAct, the Environmental Protection Act, and Occupational Safety and Health Act, and state, local and foreign counterparts to certainof such acts. In November 2013 the FDA issued a Guidance document entitled“Distribution of In Vitro Diagnostic Products Labeled for Research Use Only or Investigational Use Only,” orthe RUO Guidance, which highlights the FDA’s interpretation that distribution of RUO products with any labeling, advertisingor promotion that suggests that clinical laboratories can validate the test through their own procedures and subsequently offerit for clinical diagnostic use as an LDT is in conflict with RUO status. The RUO Guidance further articulates the FDA’s positionthat any assistance offered in performing clinical validation or verification, or similar specialized technical support, to clinicallaboratories, is in conflict with RUO status. More recently, on October 3, 2014, the FDA announced the availability of a draftguidance entitled “Framework for Regulatory Oversight of Laboratory-Developed Tests,” a risk-based oversight frameworkfor LDTs. If the draft guidance is finalized as presently written, such oversight framework includes a premarket review for higher-riskLDTs, such as those that have the same intended use as an FDA-approved or cleared companion diagnostic currently on the market,as well as other high risk and moderate risk LDTs over time. As a result of the draft guidance, we may be required to seek clearanceor approval to offer our tests for clinical use earlier than we otherwise might have done. If we engage in any activities that27are in conflict with the RUO status held by some of the tests that we sell or intend to sell, we may be subject to immediate, severeand broad FDA enforcement action that would adversely affect our ability to continue operations. Accordingly, if the FDA findsthat we are distributing our RUO products in a manner that is inconsistent with its guidance, we may be forced to stop distributionof our RUO tests until we are in compliance, which, would reduce our revenue, increase our costs and adversely affect our business,prospects, results of operations and financial condition. We cannot be sure that we can obtain necessary regulatory approvalson a timely basis, if at all, for any of the products we are developing or manufacturing or that we can maintain necessary regulatoryapprovals for our existing products, and all of the following could have a material adverse effect on our business: •significant delays in obtaining or failing to obtain required approvals;  •loss of, or changes to, previously obtained approvals;  •failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements and;  •changes to manufacturing processes, manufacturing process standards or Good Manufacturing Practices following approval or changing interpretations of these factors. Adverse perception and increased regulatory scrutiny of genemedicine and genetic research might limit our ability to conduct our business. Ethical, social and legal concerns about gene medicine, genetictesting and genetic research could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting the technologies we or our collaboratorsmay use. Recently, gene medicine studies have come under increasing scrutiny, which has delayed on-going and could delay futureclinical trials and regulatory approvals. Federal and state agencies, congressional committees and foreign governments have expressedinterest in further regulating biotechnology. More restrictive regulations or claims that our products are unsafe or pose a hazardcould prevent us from commercializing any products. Financial Risks With the exception of 2016, we have experienced significantlosses in our previous five fiscal years and quarter to quarter over such periods and our losses have resulted in the use of cashin operations. If such losses and cash uses continue, the value of your investment could decline significantly. Although for fiscal year 2016, we reported net income of $45.3million, we incurred net losses of $2.3 million, and $10.0 million for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively.If our revenues do not increase, or if our operating expenses exceed expectations or cannot be reduced, we will continue to suffersubstantial losses and use cash in operations which could have an adverse effect on our business and adversely affect your investmentin our Company. We may need additional capital to fund growth, which maynot be available on acceptable terms or at all, and could result in our business plan being limited and our business being harmed. Our ability to increase revenue and improve profitability andliquidity will depend in part on our ability to grow the Enzo Life Science business with higher margin products and increase ourmarket share and continue to grow the Enzo Clinical Lab business with new tests with higher reimbursements and increase our servicevolume which may require significant additional capital that may not be available to us. We may need additional financing due tofuture developments, changes in our business plan or failure of our current business plan to succeed, which could result from increasedmarketing, distribution or research and development costs. Our actual funding requirements could vary materially from our currentestimates. If additional financing is needed, we may not be able to raise sufficient funds on favourable terms or at all. If weissue common stock or securities convertible into common stock in the future, such issuance will result in the then-existing stockholderssustaining dilution to their relative proportion of our outstanding equity. If we fail to obtain any necessary financing on a timelybasis, then our ability to execute our current business plan may be limited, and our business, liquidity and financial conditioncould be harmed. We may incur impairment charges on our goodwill and intangibleswhich would reduce our earnings. We are subject to Statement of Financial Accounting StandardsASC 350, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (“ASC 350”) which requires that goodwill and other intangible assetsthat have an indefinite life be tested at least annually for impairment. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite livesmust also be tested for impairment between the annual tests if a triggering event occurs that would likely reduce the fair valueof the asset below its carrying amount.28As of July 31, 2016 and 2015, goodwill and intangible assetsrepresented approximately 11% and 20%, respectively, of our total assets. If we determine that there has been impairment, our financialresults for the relevant period would be reduced by the amount of the impairment, net of tax effects, if any. The Company has nointangible assets with indefinite lives. Risks relating to our Clinical Labs segment Our clinical laboratory business is subject to extensivegovernment regulation and our loss of any required certifications or licenses could require us to cease operating this part ofour business, which would reduce our revenue and injure our reputation. The clinicallaboratory industry is subject to significant governmental regulation at the Federal, state and local levels. Under the ClinicalLaboratory Improvement Act of 1967 and the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (collectively, as amended, “CLIA”)virtually all clinical laboratories, including ours, must be certified by the Federal government. Many clinical laboratories alsomust meet other governmental standards, undergo proficiency testing and are subject to inspection. Certifications or licenses arealso required by various state and local laws. The failure of our clinical laboratory to obtain or maintain such certificationsor licenses under these laws could interrupt our ability to operate our clinical laboratory business and injure our reputation.The Protecting Access to Medicare Act (“PAMA”) of 2014 is impactingthe clinical laboratory testing industry. Key parts of this legislation include provisions that provide for the establishment ofan advisory panel and a market-based process to rebase the clinical laboratory fee schedule, developing a new fee schedule andlimiting reductions in that fee schedule. If this process does not recognize the value that clinical laboratory testing bringsto the healthcare system, our business can be materially adversely impacted. Reimbursements from third-party payers, upon which our clinicallaboratory business is dependent, are subject to inconsistent rates and coverage and legislative reform that are beyond our control.This inconsistency and any reform that decreases coverage and rates could reduce our earnings and harm our business. Our clinical laboratory business is primarily dependent uponreimbursement from third-party payers, such as Medicaid, Medicare (which principally serves patients 65 and older) and commercialinsurers. We are subject to variances in reimbursement rates among different third-party payers, as well as constant renegotiationof those reimbursement rates. Government and non-government payers have in the past sought, and continue to seek, to reduce andlimit utilization and reimbursement of healthcare services, including in the area of genetic testing. We also are subject to auditby Medicare and the commercial insurers, which can result in the return of payments made to us under these programs. These variancesin reimbursement rates and audit results could reduce our margins and thus our earnings. The health care industry continues to undergo significant changeas third-party payers’ increase their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of health care services. In aneffort to address the problem of increasing health care costs, legislation has been proposed or enacted at both the Federal andstate levels to regulate health care delivery in general and clinical laboratories in particular. Some of the proposals includemanaged competition, global budgeting and price controls. Changes that decrease reimbursement rates or coverage, or increase administrativeburdens on billing third-party payers could reduce our revenues and increase our expenses. Since each payer makes its own decision as to whether to establisha policy or enter into a contract to cover our tests, as well as the amount it will reimburse for a test, seeking these approvalsis a time-consuming and costly process. In addition, the determination by a payer to cover and the amount it will reimburse forour tests will likely be made on an indication by indication basis. To date, we have obtained policy-level reimbursement approvalor contractual reimbursement for some indications for our test from a small number of commercial third-party payers, and have notobtained coverage from Medicare or any state Medicaid program. Further, we believe that establishing adequate reimbursement fromMedicare is an important factor in gaining adoption from healthcare providers. Our claims for reimbursement from commercial payersmay be denied upon submission, and we must appeal the claims. The appeals process is time consuming and expensive, and may notresult in payment. In cases where there is not a contracted rate for reimbursement, there is typically a greater co-insurance orco-payment requirement from the patient which may result in further delay or decreased likelihood of collection. We expect to continue to focus substantial resources on increasingadoption of, and coverage and reimbursement for, our current tests and any future tests we may develop. We believe it may takeseveral years to achieve coverage and adequate contracted reimbursement with a majority of third-party payers. However, we cannotpredict whether, under what circumstances, or at what payment levels payers will reimburse for our tests. If we fail to establishand maintain broad adoption of, and coverage and reimbursement for, our tests, our ability to generate revenue could be harmedand our future prospects and our business could suffer. U.S. healthcare reform legislation may result in significantchange and our business could be adversely impacted if we fail to adapt.29Government oversight of and attention to the healthcare industryin the United States is significant and increasing. Under the Patient Protections and affordable Care Act, expansion in the poolof covered lives may expand the market for clinical diagnostic testing while at the same time, various policies aimed at reducingcosts or bundling care may reduce the rates paid for such services’ the net impact of these factors on the market for ourtests is not clear. In April 2014, Congress passed the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, which include substantial changesto the way in which clinical laboratory services will be paid under Medicare. Beginning in 2017, Medicare payments for clinicallaboratory services will be paid based upon private payer rates reported by clinical laboratories across the US replacing the currentsystem, which is based upon fee schedules derived from historical charges for test from approximately 30 years ago. The impactof the new payment system on rates for tests we perform or our customers’ tests that may use our products is not clear atthis time. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act also imposesan excise tax on the seller for the sale of certain medical devices in the United States, including those purchased and used bylaboratories, beginning in 2013. The legislation also establishes the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which will be responsible,beginning in 2014, annually to submit proposals aimed at reducing Medicare cost growth while preserving quality. If the projectedgrowth in per capita Medicare costs exceeds a specified target level, the IPAB must submit proposals to reduce or eliminate thedifference. For calendar years 2015 through 2019, the target growth rate is the projected average of the increases in the ConsumerPrice Index and the medical care expenditure category of the Consumer Price Index; for 2020 and thereafter, the target growth rateis the rate of increase in gross domestic product per capita plus one percentage point. If it is necessary for the IPAB to submitproposals, they will automatically be implemented unless Congress enacts alternative proposals that achieve the same savings targets. Further, the legislation calls for a Center for Medicare andMedicaid Innovation that will examine alternative payment methodologies and conduct demonstration programs. The legislation providesfor extensive health insurance reforms, including the elimination of pre-existing condition exclusions and other limitations oncoverage, fixed percentages on medical loss ratios, expansion in Medicaid and other programs, employer mandates, individual mandates,creation of state and regional health insurance exchanges, and tax subsidies for individuals to help cover the cost of individualinsurance coverage. The legislation also permits the establishment of accountable care organizations, a new healthcare deliverymodel. While the ultimate impact of the legislation on the healthcare industry is unknown, it is likely to be extensive and mayresult in significant change. Our failure to adapt to these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business. Changes in provider mix, including continued growth in capitatedmanaged-cost health care and changes in certain third party provider agreements could have a material adverse impact on the Company’snet revenues and profitability. Certain third party provider companies have adopted nationaland regional programs which include multiple managed-care reimbursement models. If the Company is unable to participate in theseprograms or if the Company would lose a material contract, it could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s net revenuesand profitability. The number of individuals covered under managed care contractsor other similar arrangements has grown over the past several years and may continue to grow in the future. In addition, Medicareand other government healthcare programs may continue to shift to managed care. Entities providing managed care coverage have reducedpayments for medical services, including clinical laboratory services, in numerous ways such as entering into arrangements underwhich payments to a service provider are capitated, limiting testing to specified procedures, denying payment for services performedwithout prior authorization and refusing to increase fees for specified services. These trends reduce our revenues and limit ourability to pass cost increases to our customers. Also, if these or other managed care organizations do not select us as a participatingprovider, we may lose some or all of that business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition andresults of operations. Because of competitive pressures, impacts of the economyon patient traffic at our customers and the complexity and expense of the billing process in our clinical laboratory business,we must obtain new customers while maintaining existing customers to grow our business. Intense competition in the clinical laboratory business, increasingadministrative burdens upon the reimbursement process, reduced patient traffic, and reduced coverage and payments by insurers makeit necessary for us to increase our volume of laboratory services. To do so, we must obtain new customers while retaining existingcustomers. Our failure to attract new customers or the loss of existingcustomers or a reduction in business from those customers could significantly reduce our revenues and impede our ability to grow. Compliance with Medicare administrative policies, includingthose pertaining to certain automated blood chemistry profiles, may reduce the reimbursements we receive.30Containment of health care costs, including reimbursement forclinical laboratory services, has been a focus of on-going governmental activity. Clinical laboratories must bill Medicare directlyfor the services provided to Medicare beneficiaries and may only collect the amounts permitted under this fee schedule. Reimbursementto clinical laboratories under the Medicare Fee Schedule has been steadily declining since its inception. Because a significantportion of our costs is fixed, these Medicare reimbursement reductions and changes have a direct adverse effect on our net earningsand cash flows. The development of new, more cost-effective tests that canbe performed by our customers or by patients, and the continued internalization of testing by hospitals or physicians, could negativelyimpact our testing volume and revenues. The diagnostic industry is faced with changing technology andnew product introductions, including technology that enables more convenient or cost-effective testing. Some of our competitorsalso may offer testing to be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory, such as point-of-care testing that can be performedby physicians in their offices; complex testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories; and home testingthat can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers. Advances in technology also may lead to the need forless frequent testing. Further, diagnostic tests approved or cleared by the FDA for home use are automatically deemed to be “waived”tests under CLIA and may be performed by patients in their homes; test kit manufacturers could seek to increase sales to patientsof such test kits. Development of such technology and its use by our customers would reduce the demand for our laboratory-basedtesting services and negatively impact our revenues. Our business could be harmed from the loss or suspensionof a license or imposition of a fine or penalties under, or future changes in, or changing interpretations of, CLIA or state laboratorylicensing laws to which we are subject. The clinical laboratory testing industry is subject to extensivefederal and state regulation, and many of these statutes and regulations have not been interpreted by the courts. The ClinicalLaboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA, are federal regulatory standards that apply to virtually all clinical laboratories(regardless of the location, size or type of laboratory), including those operated by physicians in their offices, by requiringthat they be certified by the federal government or by a federally approved accreditation agency. CLIA does not pre-empt statelaw, which in some cases may be more stringent than federal law and require additional personnel qualifications, quality control,record maintenance and proficiency testing. The sanction for failure to comply with CLIA and state requirements may be suspension,revocation or limitation of a laboratory’s CLIA certificate, which is necessary to conduct business, as well as significantfines and/or criminal penalties. Several states have similar laws and we may be subject to similar penalties. We cannot assure that applicable statutes and regulations willnot be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely affect ourbusiness. Potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include significant fines and the suspension or lossof various licenses, certificates and authorizations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition,compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on us, which may be costly. Regulations requiring the use of “standard transactions”for healthcare services may negatively impact our profitability and cash flows. The administrative simplification provisions of the Health InsurancePortability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its implementing regulations, or HIPAA, were designed to improve the efficiencyand effectiveness of the healthcare system by facilitating the electronic exchange of information in certain financial and administrativetransactions while protecting the privacy and security of the information exchanged. The administrative simplification provisionsaddress standards for electronic transactions, security regulations and privacy regulations. The HIPAA transaction standards are complex, and subject todifferences in interpretation by payers. For instance, some payers may interpret the standards to require us to provide certaintypes of information, including demographic information not usually provided to us by physicians. While most of our transactionsare submitted and/or received in ANSI standard format, inconsistent application of transaction standards by some remaining payersor our inability to obtain certain billing information not usually provided to us by physicians could increase our costs and thecomplexity of billing. In addition, new requirements for additional standard transactions, such as claims attachments, could provetechnically difficult, time-consuming or expensive to implement. We are working closely with our payers to establish acceptableprotocols for claims submissions and with our industry trade association and an industry coalition to present issues and problemsas they arise to the appropriate regulators and standards setting organizations. Our business could be adversely impacted by CMS’ adoptionof the new coding set for diagnoses. CMS has adopted a new coding set for diagnosis, commonly knownas ICD-10, which significantly expands the coding set for diagnoses. The new coding set was required to be implemented by October1, 2015. We must adequately implement the new coding set. In addition, physicians may fail to provide appropriate codes for desiredtests; historically, delays in billing have resulted in increased costs and decreased collection of payment.31Compliance with the HIPAA security, privacy and breach notificationregulations and privacy regulations may increase our costs. The HIPAA privacy and security and breach notification regulationsestablish comprehensive federal standards with respect to the uses and disclosures PHI by Covered Entities. These regulations wererecently amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, orHITECH, to, among other things directly apply to business associates (i.e., individuals or entities who create, receive, maintainor transmit PHI on behalf of a Covered Entity in performing functions or activities regulated by HIPAA or who perform certain services,other than treatment, on behalf of Covered Entities and receive PHI in order to perform such services) with regard to certain requirements.The regulations also specify that business associates include subcontractors that create, receive, maintain or transmit PHI onbehalf of a business associate. The regulations establish a complex regulatory framework on a variety of subjects, including:  §the circumstances under which uses and disclosures of PHI are permitted or required without a specific authorization by the patient, including but not limited to treatment purposes, activities to obtain payments for our services, and our healthcare operations activities;    §a patient’s rights to access, amend and receive an accounting of certain disclosures of PHI;    §requirements to notify individuals if there is a breach of their PHI;    §the requirements for business associates and the terms of business associate agreements;    §the content of notices of privacy practices for protected health information and;    §administrative, technical and physical safeguards required of entities that use or receive PHI. We have implemented practices to meet the requirements of theHIPAA privacy, security and breach notification regulations, and updated these practices to comply with HITECH. HIPAA establishesa “floor” and does not supersede state laws that are more stringent. Therefore, we are required to comply with federalprivacy security and breach notification regulations and varying state privacy, security and breach notification laws and regulations.In addition, for healthcare data transfers from other countries relating to citizens of those countries, we must comply with thelaws of those other countries. The federal privacy regulations restrict our ability to use or disclose patient-identifiable laboratorydata, without patient authorization, for purposes other than payment, treatment, healthcare operations and certain other specifieddisclosures such as public health and governmental oversight of the health care industry. The privacy, security and breach notificationregulations provide for significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of PHI, including potential civiland criminal fines and penalties. Although the HIPAA statute and regulations do not expressly provide for a private right of damages,we also could incur damages under state laws to private parties for the wrongful use or disclosure of confidential health informationor other private personal information. Compliance with all of the HIPAA regulations, including standardtransactions, requires on-going resources from all healthcare organizations, not just clinical laboratories. While we believe ourtotal costs to comply with HIPAA will not be material to our operations or cash flows, new standard transactions and additionalcustomer requirements resulting from different interpretations of the current regulations could impose additional costs on us. FDA regulation of laboratory-developed tests, analyte specificreagents, or genetic testing could lead to increased costs and delays in introducing new genetic tests. The FDA has regulatory responsibility over instruments, testkits, reagents and other devices used to perform diagnostic testing by clinical laboratories. In the past, the FDA has claimedregulatory authority over laboratory-developed tests, but has exercised enforcement discretion in not regulating tests performedby high complexity CLIA-certified laboratories. However, on July 31, 2014, the FDA issued a 60-day notice to Congress indicatingthat the FDA intends to issue Draft Guidance on the regulation of laboratory-developed tests. In the notice, FDA indicates thatit intends to end its policy of general enforcement discretion towards laboratory-developed tests, and proposes the implementationof a risk-based regulatory framework. Under the proposed framework many laboratory-developed tests would be subject to FDA’sregulations for medical devices, including registrations and listing premarket review, medical device reports, and quality systemsregulations. The implementation of this framework would not begin until after a Final Guidance is issued and would occur over anine year period with those tests that FDA considers to be highest risk falling under FDA’s review requirements first. OnSeptember 30, 2014, the FDA issued draft guidelines and announced a 120 day public comment period on its proposal.32In December 2000, the HHS Secretary’s Advisory Committeeon Genetic Testing recommended that the FDA be the lead federal agency to regulate genetic testing. In late 2002, a new HHS Secretary’sAdvisory Committee on Genetics, Health and Society, or SACGHS, was appointed to replace the prior Advisory Committee. Ultimately,SACGHS decided that it would continue to monitor the progress of the federal agencies in the oversight of genetic technologies,but it did not believe that further action was warranted. In the meantime, the FDA is considering revising its regulations on analytespecific reagents, which are used in laboratory-developed tests, including laboratory-developed genetic testing. We cannot predictwhether FDA regulation – including premarket review requirements – will apply to the laboratory-developed tests thatwe perform or the tests in which our customers may use our products. FDA interest in or actual regulation of laboratory-developedtests or increased regulation of the various medical devices used in laboratory-developed testing could lead to increased regulatoryburdens and increased costs and delays in introducing new tests, including genetic tests and decreased demand for our products. In the past, the clinical laboratory industry has received negativepublicity. This publicity has led to increased legislation, regulation, and review of industry practices. These factors may adverselyaffect our ability to market our services, require us to change our services and increase the regulatory burdens under which weoperate, further increasing the costs of doing business and adversely affecting our operating results. If we experience a significantdisruption in our information technology systems, including our website, or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully,our business could be adversely affected. We are subject to federal and state healthcare fraud andabuse and other laws and regulations and could face substantial penalties if we are unable to fully comply with such laws. As a provider of clinical laboratory testing services, we aresubject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state and local laws and regulations governing various aspects of our business.For example, we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by both the federal government and the statesin which we conduct our business. These healthcare laws and regulations include, for example: §the federal Anti-Kickback Law, which constrains our marketing practices,educational programs, pricing policies, and relationships with healthcare providers or other entities, including third-party laboratories,by prohibiting, among other things, persons or entities from soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directlyor indirectly, in return for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease order or recommendationof, any good, facility, item or services for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare programsuch as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; §federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penaltylaws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claimsfor payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent, and which may apply to entities likeus to the extent that our interactions with customers may affect their billing or coding practices; §the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of1996, as amended, or HIPAA, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individuallyidentifiable health information, and also established federal crimes for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraudany healthcare benefit program or making false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits,items or services, and which imposed certain requirements relating to privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiablehealth information; §the federal physician self-referral law, commonly known as the StarkLaw, which prohibits a physician from making a referral to an entity for certain designated health services reimbursed by Medicareor Medicaid if the physician (or a member of the physician’s family) has a financial relationship with the entity, and whichalso prohibits the submission of any claims for reimbursement for designated health services furnished pursuant to a prohibitedreferral; §the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, and its implementing regulations,which requires manufacturers of certain drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare,Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to the United States Departmentof Health and Human Services information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to includedoctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interestsheld by physicians and their immediate family members; §federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadlyregulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers; and §state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickbackand false claims laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurersand state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from eachother in significant ways, with differing effects.33We are unable to predict what additional federal or state legislationor regulatory initiatives may be enacted in the future regarding our business or the healthcare industry in general, or what effectsuch legislation or regulations may have on us. Federal or state governments may impose additional restrictions or adopt interpretationsof existing laws that could have an adverse effect on us. We incur significant costs in complying with these laws andregulations. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possiblethat some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations, or our salestechniques or product placement strategies, are found to be in violation of, or to encourage or assist the violation by third partiesof, any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, or if we fail to maintain, renew orobtain necessary permits, licenses and approvals related to our in-house laboratory, we may be subject to penalties, includingcivil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, disgorgement, contractual damages,reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, suspension or revocation of certifications or licenses that are requiredto operate our business, injunctions and other associated remedies, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, denialor withdrawal of product clearances, or private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the nameof the government, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business. If we or others determine that any of our existingcustomer relationships do not comply with applicable laws and regulations, either due to changes in such laws and regulations orevolving interpretations of such laws and regulations, we may be required to renegotiate or terminate such relationships. Any penalties,damages, fines, exclusions, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our businessand our financial results. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of these lawsare broad and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Any action against us for violation of these laws, evenif we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attentionfrom the operation of our business. Other risks relating to our business If we fail to maintain or monitor our information systemsour businesses could be adversely affected. We depend on information systems throughout our Company to controlour Life Science manufacturing, inventory, distribution and website and the Clinical Lab processes for: processing specimens, managinginventory, processing test results and submitting claims, collecting from insurers and patients, responding to inquiries, contributingto our overall internal control processes, maintaining records of our property, plant and equipment, and recording and paying amountsdue vendors and other creditors. If we were to experience a prolonged disruption in our information systems that involve interactionswith customers and suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and/or increased costs, which could adverselyaffect our business. Cyber security risks and the failureto maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our computer hardware, software, and Internet applications andrelated tools and functions could result in damage to the Company’s reputation and/or subject the Company to costs, fines,or lawsuits. The integrity and protection of our own data, and that of itscustomers and employees, is critical to the Company’s business. The regulatory environment governing information, securityand privacy laws is increasingly demanding and continues to evolve. Maintaining compliance with applicable security and privacyregulations may increase the Company’s operating costs and/or adversely impact the Company’s ability to market itsproducts and services to customers. Although the Company’s computer and communications hardware is protected through physicaland software safeguards, it is still vulnerable to fire, storm, flood, power loss, earthquakes, telecommunications failures, physicalor software break-ins, software viruses, and similar events. These events could lead to the unauthorized access, disclosure anduse of non-public information. The techniques used by criminal elements to attack computer systems are sophisticated, change frequentlyand may originate from less regulated and remote areas of the world. As a result, the Company may not be able to address thesetechniques proactively or implement adequate preventative measures. If the Company’s computer systems are compromised, itcould be subject to fines, damages, litigation, and enforcement actions, customers could curtail or cease using its applications,and the Company could lose trade secrets, the occurrence of which could harm its business. If we fail to attract and retain key personnel, includingour senior management, our business could be adversely affected. Most of our products and services are highly technical in nature.In general, only highly qualified and trained scientists and technician personnel have the necessary skills to develop proprietarytechnological products and market our products, support our research and development programs and provide our Clinical Lab services. In addition, some of our manufacturing, quality control, safetyand compliance, information technology and e-commerce related positions are highly technical as well. Further, our sales personnelhighly trained and are important to retaining and growing our businesses. Our success depends in large part upon our ability toidentify, hire, retain and motivate highly skilled professionals.34We face intense competition for these professionals from ourcompetitors, customers, marketing partners and other companies throughout the industries in which we compete. Since our inceptionwe have successfully recruited and hired qualified key employees. Any failure on our part to hire, train, and retain a sufficientnumber of qualified professionals would seriously damage our business. We depend heavily on the services of our senior management.We believe that our future success depends on the continued services of such management. Our business may be harmed by the lossof a significant number of our senior management in a short period of time. The insurance we purchase to cover our potential businessrisk may be inadequate. Although we believe that our present insurance coverage is sufficientto cover our current estimated exposures, we cannot assure that we will not incur losses or liabilities in excess of our policylimits. In addition, although we believe that will be able to continue to obtain adequate coverage, we cannot assure that we willbe able to do so at acceptable costs. Risks relating to our international operations Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may adverselyaffect our business. Since we operate as a multinational corporation that sells andsources products in many different countries, changes in exchange rates could in the future, adversely affect our cash flows andresults of operations. Furthermore, reported sales and purchases made in non-U.S. currenciesby our international businesses, when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes, fluctuate due to exchangerate movement. Due to the number of currencies involved, the variability of currency exposures and the potential volatility ofcurrency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on future sales and operating results. We are subject to economic, political and other risks associatedwith our significant international business, which could adversely affect our financial results. We operate internationally primarily through wholly-owned subsidiarieslocated in North America and Europe. Revenues outside the United States were approximately 9% of total revenues in fiscal 2016.Our sales and earnings could be adversely affected by a variety of factors resulting from our international operations, including •future fluctuations in exchange rates;  •complex regulatory requirements and changes in those requirements;  •trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;  •multiple jurisdictions and differing tax laws, as well as changes in those laws;  •restrictions on our ability to repatriate investments and earnings from foreign operations;  •changes in the political or economic conditions in a country or region, particularly in developing or emerging markets;  •changes in shipping costs; and  •difficulties in collecting on accounts receivable. If any of these risks materialize, we could face substantialincreases in costs, the reduction of profit and the inability to do business. As we expand our commercialization activities outside ofthe United States, we will be subject to an increased risk of inadvertently conducting activities in a manner that violates theU.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws. If that occurs, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties which couldhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”),which prohibits corporations and individuals from paying, offering to pay, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to anyforeign government official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retainbusiness or to otherwise influence a person working in an official 35capacity. We are also subject to the UK Anti-Bribery Act, whichprohibits both domestic and international bribery, as well as bribery across both public and private sectors. In the course of establishing and expanding our commercial operationsand seeking regulatory approvals outside of the United States, we will need to establish and expand business relationships withvarious third parties and we will interact more frequently with foreign officials, including regulatory authorities. Expanded programsto maintain compliance with such laws will be costly and may not be effective. Any interactions with any such parties or individualswhere compensation is provided that are found to be in violation of such laws could result in substantial fines and penalties andcould materially harm our business. Furthermore, any finding of a violation under one country’s laws may increase the likelihoodthat we will be prosecuted and be found to have violated another country’s laws. If our business practices outside the UnitedStates are found to be in violation of the FCPA, UK Anti-Bribery Act or other similar law, we may be subject to significant civiland criminal penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Risks Relating to our Common Stock Our stock price has been volatile, which could result insubstantial losses for investors. Our common stock is quoted on the New York Stock Exchange, andthere has been historical volatility in the market price of our common stock. The trading price of our common stock has been, andis likely to continue to be, subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors, including: •fluctuations in our quarterly operating and earnings per share results;  •the gain or loss of significant contracts;  •the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets;  •loss of key personnel;  •announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors;  •delays in the development and introduction of new products;  •legislative or regulatory changes;  •general trends in the industries we operate;  •recommendations and/or changes in estimates by equity and market research analysts;  •biological or medical discoveries;  •disputes and/or developments concerning intellectual property, including patents and litigation matters;  •public concern as to the safety of new technologies;  •sales of common stock of existing holders;  •securities class action or other litigation;  •developments in our relationships with current or future customers and suppliers and;  •general economic conditions, both in the United States and worldwide. In addition, the stock market in general has experienced extremeprice and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of our common stock, as well as the stock of many companies inour industries. Often, price fluctuations are unrelated to operating performance of the specific companies whose stock is affected. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market priceof a company’s stock, securities class action litigation has occurred against the issuing company. If we were subject tothis type of litigation in the future, we could incur substantial costs and a diversion 36of our management’s attention andresources, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings. Any adverse determination in this typeof litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities. Because we do not intend to pay cash dividends on our commonstock, an investor in our common stock will benefit only if it appreciates in value. We currently intend to retain our retained earnings and futureearnings, if any, to finance the expansion of our business and do not expect to pay any cash dividends on our common stock in theforeseeable future. As a result, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon any future appreciation.There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which investors purchased theirshares. It may be difficult for a third party to acquire us, whichcould inhibit stockholders from realizing a premium on their stock price. We are subject to the New York anti-takeover laws regulatingcorporate takeovers. These anti-takeover laws prohibit certain business combinations between a New York corporation and any “interestedshareholder” (generally, the beneficial owner of 20% or more of the corporation’s voting shares) for five years followingthe time that the shareholder became an interested shareholder, unless the corporation’s board of directors approved thetransaction prior to the interested shareholder becoming interested. Our certificate of incorporation, as amended, and by-laws containprovisions that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us that stockholders may considerfavorable or beneficial. These provisions could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to electdirectors and take other corporate actions. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to payin the future for shares of our common stock. These provisions include: •a staggered board of directors, so that it would take three successive annual meetings to replace all directors; and  •advance notice requirements for the submission by stockholders of nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting. Future sales of shares of our common stock or the issuanceof securities senior to our common stock could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our ability to raisefunds in new equity offerings. We are not restricted from issuing additional common stock,preferred stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock. Future sales of a substantial number of our sharesof common stock or equity-related securities in the public market or privately, or the perception that such sales could occur,could adversely affect prevailing trading prices of our common stock, and could impair our ability to raise capital through futureofferings of equity or equity-related securities. No prediction can be made as to the effect, if any, that future sales of sharesof common stock or the availability of shares of common stock for future sale will have on the trading price of our common stock. Risk relating to our debt Our use of leverage may expose us to substantial risks, includinginterest rate risk. As of July 31, 2016 and 2015, we had $1.6 million and $3.0 million,respectively, in borrowings under our Revolving Loan and Security Agreement (“credit agreement”), which expires December7, 2016. In addition, we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Accordingly, we are exposed to the typical risks associatedwith the use of leverage. Increased leverage makes it more difficult for us to withstand adverse economic conditions or businessplan variances, to take advantage of new business opportunities, or to make necessary capital expenditures. The existing creditagreement contains restrictive covenant restrictions that limit our ability to conduct our business, including restrictions onour ability to incur additional indebtedness. Our ability to maintain our compliance with these covenants is dependent on our financialperformance, which is influenced by a number of factors. Violation of any of these covenants would result in an event of defaultunder the credit agreement. Upon the occurrence of an event of default that is not cured or waived, the lender would have the abilityto accelerate the repayment of all amounts then outstanding under the credit agreement. In the event of a default, and during thecontinuance of an event of default under the credit agreement, we would no longer have the right to borrow additional funds underthe credit agreement. Under these circumstances, we may not be able to pay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance iton terms that are acceptable to us or at all. Our credit agreement requires the payment of interest basedon 3 month LIBOR plus a fixed rate. Fluctuations in this variable interest rate could negatively impact our financial results.37In addition, there can be no assurance that we can extend ornegotiate an update to the Revolving Loan under favorable condition and satisfactory terms upon expiration in December 2016. "
10,ENZ,ENZO BIOCHEM INC,2015-10-13,"Risk Factors
 Financial Risks We have experienced significant losses in our previous five fiscalyears and quarter to quarter over such periods and our losses have resulted in the use of cash in operations. If such losses andcash uses continue, the value of your investment could decline significantly. We incurred net losses of $2.3 million, $10.0 million, and $18.2million for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. If our revenues do not increase, or if our operatingexpenses exceed expectations or cannot be reduced, we will continue to suffer substantial losses and use cash in operations whichcould have an adverse effect on our business and adversely affect your investment in our Company. We may need additional capital to fund growth, which may notbe available on acceptable terms or at all, and could result in our business plan being limited and our business being harmed. Our ability to increase revenue and improve profitability and liquiditywill depend in part on our ability to grow the Enzo Life Science business with higher margin products and increase our market shareand continue to grow the Enzo Clinical Lab business with new tests with higher reimbursements and increase our service volume whichmay require significant additional capital that may not be available to us. We may need additional financing due to future developments,changes in our business plan or failure of our current business plan to succeed, which could result from increased marketing, distributionor research and development costs. Our actual funding requirements could vary materially from our current estimates. If additionalfinancing is needed, we may not be able to raise sufficient funds on favourable terms or at all. If we issue common stock or securitiesconvertible into common stock in the future, such issuance will result in the then-existing stockholders sustaining dilution totheir relative proportion of our outstanding equity. If we fail to obtain any necessary financing on a timely basis, then our abilityto execute our current business plan may be limited, and our business, liquidity and financial condition could be harmed. Business Risks Our operating results may vary from period to period. Our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarterand from year to year, depending on a variety of factors including: •competitive conditions, including changes in third-party reimbursements;  •health care reform regulations affecting providers and plan sponsors;  •changes in reimbursement policies from third party payers;  •exchange rate fluctuations;  •changes in tax laws, the results of tax audits or the measurement of tax uncertainties;  •the timing of our research and development, sales and marketing expenses;23•the introduction of new products by us or our competitors;  •the success of identifying, acquiring and integrating businesses that complement our product offerings, add new technology or add presence in a market;  •expenses associated with defending our intellectual property portfolio;  •customer demand for our products due to changes in purchasing requirements and research needs;  •general worldwide economic conditions affecting funding of research; and  •seasonal fluctuations affected by weather and holiday periods. Consequently, results for any interim period may not necessarilybe indicative of results in subsequent periods. A significant proportion of our sales are to academic centers,funded by government grants in our major markets globally. Governments around the world have been reviewing long term publicfunding of life science research in response to the problems arising from global financial pressures. As a result, the availablefunds for discretionary purchases from market to market have been capped or reduced based on available National budgets. Reducedgrants for researchers could impact our business, in the amount, price and type of products bought and used by customers. A significant proportion of our sales are to customers in pharmaceuticaland biotech companies. Globally, pharmaceutical companies are challenging internal budgets,and the return of investment from their R&D spend. This could impact our business, in the amount, price and type of productsbought and used by customers. Our future success will depend in part upon our ability to enhanceexisting products, develop and introduce new products and realize commercial acceptance of those products, in a rapidly changingtechnological environment. The market for our products is characterized by rapidly changingtechnology, evolving industry standards and new product introductions, which may make our existing products obsolete. Our futuresuccess will depend in part upon our ability to enhance existing products, develop and introduce new products, and realize commercialacceptance of those products The development of new or enhanced products is a complex and uncertainprocess requiring the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends as well as precise technological execution. In addition,the successful development of new products will depend on the development of new technologies. We will be required to undertaketime-consuming and costly development activities and to seek regulatory approval for these new products. We may experience difficultiesthat could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of these new products. Regulatory clearanceor approval of any new products may not be granted by the FDA, state-wide agency or foreign regulatory authorities on a timelybasis, or at all, and the new products may not be successfully commercialized. We may be unable to identify, acquire and integrate acquisitiontargets. During the fiscal years 2007 through 2009 we made significantacquisitions in our Life Sciences segment. Our strategy envisions, if an opportunistic target is identified, future growth fromacquiring and integrating similar operations and/or product lines. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identifysuitable acquisition candidates and, once identified, to negotiate successfully their acquisition at a price or on terms and conditionsfavorable to us, or to integrate the operations of such acquired businesses with the existing operations. In addition, we competefor acquisition candidates with other entities, some of which have greater financial resources than ours. Failure to implementsuccessfully our acquisition strategy would limit our potential growth. Our inability to carry out certain of our marketing and salesplans may make it difficult for us to grow or maintain our business. The Life Sciences segment continues a marketing program designedto more directly service its end users, while simultaneously promoting the Enzo Life Science brand, with reference to our acquiredbrands. We will continue to reach out to our customers using our direct field sales force, in-house business team, the on-goingenhancement of our interactive websites, continued attendance at top industry trade meetings, and publications to customers andin leading scientific journals. In addition to our direct sales, we operate worldwide through wholly-owned subsidiaries (in USA,Switzerland, Belgium, Germany, and the UK), a branch office in France and a network of third-party distributors in most other significantmarkets. If we are unable to successfully continue these programs, we may be unable to grow and our business could suffer.24We face significant competition, which could cause us to decreasethe prices for our products or services or render our products uneconomical or obsolete, any of which could reduce our revenuesand limit our growth. Our competitors in the biotechnology industry in the United Statesand abroad are numerous and include major pharmaceutical, energy, food and chemical companies, as well as specialized genetic engineeringfirms. Many of our large competitors have substantially greater resources than us and have the capability of developing productswhich compete directly with our products. Many of these companies are performing research in the same areas as we are. The marketsfor our products are also subject to competitive risks because markets are highly price competitive. Our competitors have competedin the past by lowering prices on certain products. The clinical laboratory business is highly fragmented and intenselycompetitive, and we compete with numerous national and local companies. Some of these entities are larger than we are and havegreater resources than we do. We compete primarily on the basis of the quality of our testing, reporting and information services,our reputation in the medical community, the pricing of our services and our ability to employ qualified professionals. These competitive conditions could, among other things: •Require us to reduce our prices to retain market share;  •Require us to increase our marketing efforts which could reduce our profit margins;  •Increase our cost of labor to attract qualified personnel;  •Render our biotechnology products uneconomical or obsolete or;  •Reduce our revenue. Ethical, legal and social concerns surrounding the use of geneticinformation could reduce demand for our products. Genetic testing has raised ethical issues regarding privacy andthe appropriate uses of the resulting information. For these reasons, governmental authorities may call for limits on or regulationof the use of genetic testing or prohibit testing for genetic predisposition to certain conditions, particularly for those thathave no known cure. Similarly, such concerns may lead individuals to refuse to use genetics tests even if permissible. Any of thesescenarios could reduce the potential markets for our molecular diagnostic products, which could have a material adverse effecton our business, financial condition and results of operations. We depend on distributors and contract manufacturers and suppliersfor materials that could impair our ability to manufacture or distribute our products. Our Life Sciences segment manufactures and distributes our own brandproducts and the products of third party manufacturers and suppliers. Distributors also sell our branded products. To the extentwe are unable to maintain or replace a distributor in a reasonable time period, or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all,our operations could be disrupted. Outside distributors, suppliers and contract manufacturers providekey finished goods, components and raw materials used in the sale and manufacture of our products. Although we believe that alternativesources for components and raw materials are available, any supply interruption in a limited or sole source component or raw materialwould harm our ability to manufacture our products until a new source of supply is identified and qualified. In addition, an uncorrecteddefect or supplier’s variation in a component or raw material, either unknown to us or incompatible with our manufacturingprocess, could harm our ability to manufacture products. We might not be able to find a sufficient alternative supplier in a reasonabletime period, or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we fail to obtain a supplier for the components of our products,our operations could be disrupted. We use hazardous materials in our business. Any claims relatingto improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials could be costly and time-consuming. Our manufacturing, clinical laboratory and research and developmentprocesses involve the storage, use and disposal of hazardous substances, including hazardous chemicals, biological hazardous materialsand radioactive compounds. We are subject to governmental regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposalof materials and waste products. Although we believe that our safety and environmental management practices and procedures forhandling and disposing of these hazardous materials are in accordance with good industry practice and comply with applicable laws,permits, licenses and regulations, the risk of accidental environmental or human contamination or injury from the release or exposureof hazardous materials cannot be completely25eliminated. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for any damages thatresult, including environmental clean-up or decontamination costs, and any such liability could exceed the limits of, or fall outsidethe coverage of, our insurance. We may not be able to maintain insurance on acceptable terms, orat all. We could be required to incur significant costs to comply with current or future environmental and public and workplacesafety and health laws and regulations. We are required to expend significant resources for researchand development for our products in development and these products may not be developed successfully. Failure to successfully developthese products may prevent us from earning a return on our research and development expenditures. The products we are developing are at various stages of developmentand clinical evaluations and may require further technical development and investment to determine whether commercial applicationis practicable. There can be no assurance that our efforts will result in products with valuable commercial applications. Our cashrequirements may vary materially from current estimates because of results of our research and development programs, competitiveand technological advances and other factors. In any event, we will require substantial funds to conduct development activitiesand pre-clinical and clinical trials, apply for regulatory approvals and commercialize products, if any, that are developed. We do not have any commitments or arrangements to obtain any additionalfinancing and there is no assurance that required financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. Even if wespend substantial amounts on research and development, our potential products may not be developed successfully. If our product candidates on which we have expended significantamounts for research and development are not commercialized, we will not earn a return on our research and development expenditures,which may harm our business. Risks relating to our Intellectual Property and RegulatoryApproval Protecting our proprietary rights is difficult and costly. Ifwe fail to adequately protect or enforce our proprietary rights, we could lose potential revenue from licensing and royalties. Our potential revenue and success depends in large part on our abilityto obtain, maintain and enforce our patents. Our ability to commercialize any product successfully will largely depend on our abilityto obtain and maintain patents of sufficient scope to prevent third parties from developing similar or competitive products. Inthe absence of patent protection, competitors may impact our business by developing and marketing substantially equivalent productsand technology. Patent disputes are frequent and can preclude the commercializationof products. We have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be, involved in material patent litigation, such asthe matters discussed under “Part I - Item 3. Legal Proceedings” in this report. Patent protection litigation is time-consumingand we have incurred and anticipate continuing to incur significant legal costs. In addition, an adverse decision could force usto either obtain third-party licenses at a material cost or cease using the technology or product in dispute. We have filed applications for United States and foreign patentscovering certain aspects of our technology, but there is no assurance that pending patents will issue or as to the degree of protectionwhich any issued patent might afford. Lawsuits, including patent infringements, in the biotechnologyindustry are not uncommon. If we become involved in any significant litigation, we would suffer as a result of the diversion ofour management’s attention, the expense of litigation and any judgments against us. In addition to intellectual property litigation for infringement,other substantial, complex or extended litigation could result in large expenditures by us and distraction of our management. Patentlitigation is time-consuming and costly in its own right and could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties. In addition,an adverse decision could force us to either obtain third-party licenses at a material cost or cease using the technology or productin dispute. In addition, lawsuits by employees, stockholders, collaborators or distributors could be very costly and substantiallydisrupt our business. Disputes from time to time with companies or individuals are not uncommon in the biotechnology industry,and we cannot assure you that we will always be able to resolve them out of court. We also utilize certain unpatented proprietary technology and noassurance can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary technology, that such proprietarytechnology will not be disclosed or that we can meaningfully protect our rights to such proprietary technology. We may incur impairment charges on our goodwill and intangibleswhich would reduce our earnings.26We are subject to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ASC350, “Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (“ASC 350”) which requires that goodwill and other intangible assets thathave an indefinite life be tested at least annually for impairment. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite livesmust also be tested for impairment between the annual tests if a triggering event occurs that would likely reduce the fair valueof the asset below its carrying amount. As of July 31, 2015 and 2014, goodwill and intangible assets representedapproximately 20% and 24%, respectively, of our total assets. If we determine that there has been impairment, our financial resultsfor the relevant period would be reduced by the amount of the impairment, net of tax effects, if any. The Company has no intangibleassets with indefinite lives. Our business is subject to governmentallaws and regulations. We may be unable to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals for our products, which could reduce our revenueor prevent us from earning a return on our research and development expenditures. Our research, preclinical development, clinical trials, productmanufacturing and marketing are subject to regulation by the FDA and similar health authorities in foreign countries. FDA approvalis required for our products, as well as the manufacturing processes and facilities, if any, used to produce our products thatmay be sold in the United States. The process of obtaining approvals from the FDA is costly, time consuming and often subject tounanticipated delays. Even if regulatory approval is granted, such approval may include significant limitations on indicated usesfor which any products could be marketed. Further, even if such regulatory approvals are obtained, a marketed product and its manufacturerare subject to continued review, and later discovery of previously unknown problems may result in restrictions on such productor manufacturer, including withdrawal of the product from the market. New government regulations in the United States or foreign countriesalso may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development. Further, because genetherapy is a relatively new technology and has not been extensively tested in humans, the regulatory requirements governing genetherapy products are uncertain and may be subject to substantial further review by various regulatory authorities in the UnitedStates and abroad. This uncertainty may result in extensive delays in initiating clinical trials and in the regulatory approvalprocess. Our failure to obtain regulatory approval of our proposed products, processes or facilities could have a material adverseeffect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The proposed products under development may also be subjectto certain other federal, state and local government regulations, including, but not limited to, the Federal Food, Drug and CosmeticAct, the Environmental Protection Act, and Occupational Safety and Health Act, and state, local and foreign counterparts to certainof such acts. In November 2013 the FDA issued a Guidance document entitled“Distribution of In Vitro Diagnostic Products Labeled for Research Use Only or Investigational Use Only,” or theRUO Guidance, which highlights the FDA’s interpretation that distribution of RUO products with any labeling, advertising or promotionthat suggests that clinical laboratories can validate the test through their own procedures and subsequently offer it for clinicaldiagnostic use as an LDT is in conflict with RUO status. The RUO Guidance further articulates the FDA’s position that any assistanceoffered in performing clinical validation or verification, or similar specialized technical support, to clinical laboratories,is in conflict with RUO status. More recently, on October 3, 2014, the FDA announced the availability of a draft guidance entitled“Framework for Regulatory Oversight of Laboratory-Developed Tests,” a risk-based oversight framework for LDTs. If thedraft guidance is finalized as presently written, such oversight framework includes a premarket review for higher-risk LDTs, suchas those that have the same intended use as an FDA-approved or cleared companion diagnostic currently on the market, as well asother high risk and moderate risk LDTs over time. As a result of the draft guidance, we may be required to seek clearance or approvalto offer our tests for clinical use earlier than we otherwise might have done. If we engage in any activities that are in conflictwith the RUO status held by some of the tests that we sell or intend to sell, we may be subject to immediate, severe and broadFDA enforcement action that would adversely affect our ability to continue operations. Accordingly, if the FDA finds that we aredistributing our RUO products in a manner that is inconsistent with its guidance, we may be forced to stop distribution of ourRUO tests until we are in compliance, which, would reduce our revenue, increase our costs and adversely affect our business, prospects,results of operations and financial condition. We cannot be sure that we can obtain necessary regulatory approvalson a timely basis, if at all, for any of the products we are developing or manufacturing or that we can maintain necessary regulatoryapprovals for our existing products, and all of the following could have a material adverse effect on our business: •significant delays in obtaining or failing to obtain required approvals;  •loss of, or changes to, previously obtained approvals;  •failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements and;  •changes to manufacturing processes, manufacturing process standards or Good Manufacturing Practices following approval or changing interpretations of these factors.27Adverse perception and increased regulatory scrutiny of genemedicine and genetic research might limit our ability to conduct our business. Ethical, social and legal concerns about gene medicine, genetictesting and genetic research could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting the technologies we or our collaboratorsmay use. Recently, gene medicine studies have come under increasing scrutiny, which has delayed ongoing and could delay futureclinical trials and regulatory approvals. Federal and state agencies, congressional committees and foreign governments have expressedinterest in further regulating biotechnology. More restrictive regulations or claims that our products are unsafe or pose a hazardcould prevent us from commercializing any products. Risks relating to our Clinical Labs segment Our clinical laboratory business is subject to extensive governmentregulation and our loss of any required certifications or licenses could require us to cease operating this part of our business,which would reduce our revenue and injure our reputation. The clinical laboratoryindustry is subject to significant governmental regulation at the Federal, state and local levels. Under the Clinical LaboratoryImprovement Act of 1967 and the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (collectively, as amended, “CLIA”)virtually all clinical laboratories, including ours, must be certified by the Federal government. Many clinical laboratories alsomust meet other governmental standards, undergo proficiency testing and are subject to inspection. Certifications or licenses arealso required by various state and local laws. The failure of our clinical laboratory to obtain or maintain such certificationsor licenses under these laws could interrupt our ability to operate our clinical laboratory business and injure our reputation. The Protecting Access to Medicare Act (“PAMA”) of 2014 is impactingthe clinical laboratory testing industry. Key parts of this legislation include provisions that provide for the establishment ofan advisory panel and a market-based process to rebase the clinical laboratory fee schedule, developing a new fee schedule andlimiting reductions in that fee schedule. If this process does not recognize the value that clinical laboratory testing bringsto the healthcare system, our business can be materially adversely impacted. Reimbursements from third-party payers, upon which our clinicallaboratory business is dependent, are subject to inconsistent rates and coverage and legislative reform that are beyond our control.This inconsistency and any reform that decreases coverage and rates could reduce our earnings and harm our business. Our clinical laboratory business is primarily dependent upon reimbursementfrom third-party payers, such as Medicaid, Medicare (which principally serves patients 65 and older) and commercial insurers. Weare subject to variances in reimbursement rates among different third-party payers, as well as constant renegotiation of thosereimbursement rates. Government and non-government payers have in the past sought, and continue to seek, to reduce and limit utilizationand reimbursement of healthcare services, including in the area of genetic testing. We also are subject to audit by Medicare andthe commercial insurers, which can result in the return of payments made to us under these programs. These variances in reimbursementrates and audit results could reduce our margins and thus our earnings. The health care industry continues to undergo significant changeas third-party payers’ increase their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of health care services. In aneffort to address the problem of increasing health care costs, legislation has been proposed or enacted at both the Federal andstate levels to regulate health care delivery in general and clinical laboratories in particular. Some of the proposals includemanaged competition, global budgeting and price controls. Changes that decrease reimbursement rates or coverage, or increase administrativeburdens on billing third-party payers could reduce our revenues and increase our expenses. U.S. healthcare reform legislation may result in significantchange and our business could be adversely impacted if we fail to adapt. Government oversight of and attention to the healthcare industryin the United States is significant and increasing. Under the Patient Protections and affordable Care Act, expansion in the poolof covered lives may expand the market for clinical diagnostic testing while at the same time, various policies aimed at reducingcosts or bundling care may reduce the rates paid for such services’ the net impact of these factors on the market for ourtests is not clear. In April 2014, Congress passed the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, which include substantial changesto the way in which clinical laboratory services will be paid under Medicare. Beginning in 2017, Medicare payments for clinicallaboratory services will be paid based upon private payer rates reported by clinical laboratories across the US replacing the currentsystem, which is based upon fee schedules derived from historical charges for test from approximately 30 years ago. The impactof the new payment system on rates for tests we perform or our customers’ tests that may use our products is not clear atthis time. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act also imposes an excisetax on the seller for the sale of certain medical devices in the United States, including those purchased and used by laboratories,beginning in 2013. The legislation also establishes the Independent28Payment Advisory Board, which will be responsible, beginningin 2014, annually to submit proposals aimed at reducing Medicare cost growth while preserving quality. If the projected growthin per capita Medicare costs exceeds a specified target level, the IPAB must submit proposals to reduce or eliminate the difference.For calendar years 2015 through 2019, the target growth rate is the projected average of the increases in the Consumer Price Indexand the medical care expenditure category of the Consumer Price Index; for 2020 and thereafter, the target growth rate is the rateof increase in gross domestic product per capita plus one percentage point. If it is necessary for the IPAB to submit proposals,they will automatically be implemented unless Congress enacts alternative proposals that achieve the same savings targets. Further, the legislation calls for a Center for Medicare and MedicaidInnovation that will examine alternative payment methodologies and conduct demonstration programs. The legislation provides forextensive health insurance reforms, including the elimination of pre-existing condition exclusions and other limitations on coverage,fixed percentages on medical loss ratios, expansion in Medicaid and other programs, employer mandates, individual mandates, creationof state and regional health insurance exchanges, and tax subsidies for individuals to help cover the cost of individual insurancecoverage. The legislation also permits the establishment of accountable care organizations, a new healthcare delivery model. Whilethe ultimate impact of the legislation on the healthcare industry is unknown, it is likely to be extensive and may result in significantchange. Our failure to adapt to these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business. Changes in provider mix, including continued growth in capitatedmanaged-cost health care and changes in certain third party provider agreements could have a material adverse impact on the Company’snet revenues and profitability. Certain third party provider companies have adopted national andregional programs which include multiple managed-care reimbursement models. If the Company is unable to participate in these programsor if the Company would lose a material contract, it could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s net revenues andprofitability. The number of individuals covered under managed care contracts orother similar arrangements has grown over the past several years and may continue to grow in the future. In addition, Medicareand other government healthcare programs may continue to shift to managed care. Entities providing managed care coverage have reducedpayments for medical services, including clinical laboratory services, in numerous ways such as entering into arrangements underwhich payments to a service provider are capitated, limiting testing to specified procedures, denying payment for services performedwithout prior authorization and refusing to increase fees for specified services. These trends reduce our revenues and limit ourability to pass cost increases to our customers. Also, if these or other managed care organizations do not select us as a participatingprovider, we may lose some or all of that business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition andresults of operations. Because of competitive pressures, impacts of the economy on patienttraffic at our customers and the complexity and expense of the billing process in our clinical laboratory business, we must obtainnew customers while maintaining existing customers to grow our business. Intense competition in the clinical laboratory business, increasingadministrative burdens upon the reimbursement process, reduced patient traffic, and reduced coverage and payments by insurers makeit necessary for us to increase our volume of laboratory services. To do so, we must obtain new customers while retaining existingcustomers. Our failure to attract new customers or the loss of existing customersor a reduction in business from those customers could significantly reduce our revenues and impede our ability to grow. Compliance with Medicare administrative policies, including thosepertaining to certain automated blood chemistry profiles, may reduce the reimbursements we receive. Containment of health care costs, including reimbursement for clinicallaboratory services, has been a focus of ongoing governmental activity. Clinical laboratories must bill Medicare directly for theservices provided to Medicare beneficiaries and may only collect the amounts permitted under this fee schedule. Reimbursement toclinical laboratories under the Medicare Fee Schedule has been steadily declining since its inception. Because a significant portionof our costs is fixed, these Medicare reimbursement reductions and changes have a direct adverse effect on our net earnings andcash flows. The development of new, more cost-effective tests that can beperformed by our customers or by patients, and the continued internalization of testing by hospitals or physicians, could negativelyimpact our testing volume and revenues. The diagnostic industry is faced with changing technology and newproduct introductions, including technology that enables more convenient or cost-effective testing. Some of our competitors alsomay offer testing to be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory, such as point-of-care testing that can be performedby physicians in their offices; complex testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories; and home testingthat can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers.29Advances in technology also may lead to the need forless frequent testing. Further, diagnostic tests approved or cleared by the FDA for home use are automatically deemed to be “waived”tests under CLIA and may be performed by patients in their homes; test kit manufacturers could seek to increase sales to patientsof such test kits. Development of such technology and its use by our customers would reduce the demand for our laboratory-basedtesting services and negatively impact our revenues. Our business could be harmed from the loss or suspension of alicense or imposition of a fine or penalties under, or future changes in, or changing interpretations of, CLIA or state laboratorylicensing laws to which we are subject. The clinical laboratory testing industry is subject to extensivefederal and state regulation, and many of these statutes and regulations have not been interpreted by the courts. The ClinicalLaboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA, are federal regulatory standards that apply to virtually all clinical laboratories(regardless of the location, size or type of laboratory), including those operated by physicians in their offices, by requiringthat they be certified by the federal government or by a federally approved accreditation agency. CLIA does not pre-empt statelaw, which in some cases may be more stringent than federal law and require additional personnel qualifications, quality control,record maintenance and proficiency testing. The sanction for failure to comply with CLIA and state requirements may be suspension,revocation or limitation of a laboratory’s CLIA certificate, which is necessary to conduct business, as well as significantfines and/or criminal penalties. Several states have similar laws and we may be subject to similar penalties. We cannot assure that applicable statutes and regulations will notbe interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely affect our business.Potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include significant fines and the suspension or loss of variouslicenses, certificates and authorizations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, compliancewith future legislation could impose additional requirements on us, which may be costly. Regulations requiring the use of “standard transactions”for healthcare services may negatively impact our profitability and cash flows. The administrative simplification provisions of the Health InsurancePortability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its implementing regulations, or HIPAA, were designed to improve the efficiencyand effectiveness of the healthcare system by facilitating the electronic exchange of information in certain financial and administrativetransactions while protecting the privacy and security of the information exchanged. The administrative simplification provisionsaddress standards for electronic transactions, security regulations and privacy regulations. The HIPAA transaction standards are complex, and subject to differencesin interpretation by payers. For instance, some payers may interpret the standards to require us to provide certain types of information,including demographic information not usually provided to us by physicians. While most of our transactions are submitted and/orreceived in ANSI standard format, inconsistent application of transaction standards by some remaining payers or our inability toobtain certain billing information not usually provided to us by physicians could increase our costs and the complexity of billing.In addition, new requirements for additional standard transactions, such as claims attachments, could prove technically difficult,time-consuming or expensive to implement. We are working closely with our payers to establish acceptable protocols for claims submissionsand with our industry trade association and an industry coalition to present issues and problems as they arise to the appropriateregulators and standards setting organizations. Our business could be adversely impacted by CMS’ adoptionof the new coding set for diagnoses.CMS has adopted a new coding set for diagnosis, commonlyknown as ICD-10, which significantly expands the coding set for diagnoses. The new coding set was required to be implemented byOctober 1, 2015. We must adequately implement the new coding set. In addition, physicians may fail to provide appropriate codesfor desired tests; historically, delays in billing have resulted in increased costs and decreased collection of payment.Compliance with the HIPAA security, privacy and breach notificationregulations and privacy regulations may increase our costs. The HIPAA privacy and security and breach notification regulationsestablish comprehensive federal standards with respect to the uses and disclosures PHI by Covered Entities. These regulations wererecently amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, orHITECH, to, among other things directly apply to business associates (i.e., individuals or entities who create, receive, maintainor transmit PHI on behalf of a Covered Entity in performing functions or activities regulated by HIPAA or who perform certain services,other than treatment, on behalf of Covered Entities and receive PHI in order to perform such services) with regard to certain requirements.The regulations also specify that business associates include subcontractors that create, receive, maintain or transmit PHI onbehalf of a business associate. The regulations establish a complex regulatory framework on a variety of subjects, including:30 §the circumstances under which uses and disclosures of PHI are permitted or required without a specific authorization by the patient, including but not limited to treatment purposes, activities to obtain payments for our services, and our healthcare operations activities;    §a patient’s rights to access, amend and receive an accounting of certain disclosures of PHI;    §requirements to notify individuals if there is a breach of their PHI;    §the requirements for business associates and the terms of business associate agreements;    §the content of notices of privacy practices for protected health information and;    §administrative, technical and physical safeguards required of entities that use or receive PHI. We have implemented practices to meet the requirements of the HIPAAprivacy, security and breach notification regulations, and updated these practices to comply with HITECH. HIPAA establishes a “floor”and does not supersede state laws that are more stringent. Therefore, we are required to comply with federal privacy security andbreach notification regulations and varying state privacy, security and breach notification laws and regulations. In addition,for healthcare data transfers from other countries relating to citizens of those countries, we must comply with the laws of thoseother countries. The federal privacy regulations restrict our ability to use or disclose patient-identifiable laboratory data,without patient authorization, for purposes other than payment, treatment, healthcare operations and certain other specified disclosuressuch as public health and governmental oversight of the health care industry. The privacy, security and breach notification regulationsprovide for significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of PHI, including potential civil and criminalfines and penalties. Although the HIPAA statute and regulations do not expressly provide for a private right of damages, we alsocould incur damages under state laws to private parties for the wrongful use or disclosure of confidential health information orother private personal information. Compliance with all of the HIPAA regulations, including standardtransactions, requires ongoing resources from all healthcare organizations, not just clinical laboratories. While we believe ourtotal costs to comply with HIPAA will not be material to our operations or cash flows, new standard transactions and additionalcustomer requirements resulting from different interpretations of the current regulations could impose additional costs on us. FDA regulation of laboratory-developed tests, analyte specificreagents, or genetic testing could lead to increased costs and delays in introducing new genetic tests. The FDA has regulatory responsibility over instruments, test kits,reagents and other devices used to perform diagnostic testing by clinical laboratories. In the past, the FDA has claimed regulatoryauthority over laboratory-developed tests, but has exercised enforcement discretion in not regulating tests performed by high complexityCLIA-certified laboratories. However, on July 31, 2014, the FDA issued a 60-day notice to Congress indicating that the FDA intendsto issue Draft Guidance on the regulation of laboratory-developed tests. In the notice, FDA indicates that it intends to end itspolicy of general enforcement discretion towards laboratory-developed tests, and proposes the implementation of a risk-based regulatoryframework. Under the proposed framework many laboratory-developed tests would be subject to FDA’s regulations for medicaldevices, including registrations and listing premarket review, medical device reports, and quality systems regulations. The implementationof this framework would not begin until after a Final Guidance is issued and would occur over a nine year period with those teststhat FDA considers to be highest risk falling under FDA’s review requirements first. On September 30, 2014, the FDA issueddraft guidelines and announced a 120 day public comment period on its proposal. In December 2000, the HHS Secretary’s Advisory Committee onGenetic Testing recommended that the FDA be the lead federal agency to regulate genetic testing. In late 2002, a new HHS Secretary’sAdvisory Committee on Genetics, Health and Society, or SACGHS, was appointed to replace the prior Advisory Committee. Ultimately,SACGHS decided that it would continue to monitor the progress of the federal agencies in the oversight of genetic technologies,but it did not believe that further action was warranted. In the meantime, the FDA is considering revising its regulations on analytespecific reagents, which are used in laboratory-developed tests, including laboratory-developed genetic testing. We cannot predictwhether FDA regulation – including premarket review requirements – will apply to the laboratory-developed tests thatwe perform or the tests in which our customers may use our products. FDA interest in or actual regulation of laboratory-developedtests or increased regulation of the various medical devices used in laboratory-developed testing could lead to increased regulatoryburdens and increased costs and delays in introducing new tests, including genetic tests and decreased demand for our products. In the past, the clinical laboratory industry has received negativepublicity. This publicity has led to increased legislation, regulation, and review of industry practices. These factors may adverselyaffect our ability to market our services, require us to change our31services and increase the regulatory burdens under which weoperate, further increasing the costs of doing business and adversely affecting our operating results. If we experience a significantdisruption in our information technology systems, including our website, or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully,our business could be adversely affected. We are subject to federal and state healthcare fraudand abuse and other laws and regulations and could face substantial penalties if we are unable to fully comply with such laws. As a provider of clinical laboratory testing services, weare subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state and local laws and regulations governing various aspects of ourbusiness. For example, we are subject to healthcare fraud and abuse regulation and enforcement by both the federal government andthe states in which we conduct our business. These healthcare laws and regulations include, for example: ·the                                         federal Anti-Kickback Law, which constrains our marketing practices, educational programs,                                         pricing policies, and relationships with healthcare providers or other entities, including                                         third-party laboratories, by prohibiting, among other things, persons or entities from                                         soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in                                         return for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease                                         order or recommendation of, any good, facility, item or services for which payment may                                         be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as the Medicare                                         and Medicaid programs;   ·federal                                         civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit,                                         among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to                                         be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payers                                         that are false or fraudulent, and which may apply to entities like us to the extent that                                         our interactions with customers may affect their billing or coding practices;   ·the                                         federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, or HIPAA,                                         which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission                                         of individually identifiable health information, and also established federal crimes                                         for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program                                         or making false statements in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare                                         benefits, items or services, and which imposed certain requirements relating to privacy,                                         security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information;   ·the                                         federal physician self-referral law, commonly known as the Stark Law, which prohibits                                         a physician from making a referral to an entity for certain designated health services                                         reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid if the physician (or a member of the physician’s                                         family) has a financial relationship with the entity, and which also prohibits the submission                                         of any claims for reimbursement for designated health services furnished pursuant to                                         a prohibited referral;   ·the                                         federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, and its implementing regulations, which requires                                         manufacturers of certain drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment                                         is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with                                         certain exceptions) to report annually to the United States Department of Health and                                         Human Services information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians                                         (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and                                         teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians                                         and their immediate family members;   ·federal                                         consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities                                         and activities that potentially harm consumers; and   ·state                                         law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims                                         laws, which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including                                         commercial insurers and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information                                         in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, with                                         differing effects. We are unable to predict what additional federal or statelegislation or regulatory initiatives may be enacted in the future regarding our business or the healthcare industry in general,or what effect such legislation or regulations may have on us. Federal or state governments may impose additional restrictionsor adopt interpretations of existing laws that could have an adverse effect on us. We incur significant costs in complying with these lawsand regulations. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it ispossible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations,or our sales techniques or product placement strategies, are found to be in violation of, or to encourage or assist the violationby third parties of, any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, or if we fail to maintain,renew or obtain necessary permits, licenses and approvals related to our in-house laboratory, we may be subject to penalties, includingcivil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, disgorgement, contractual damages,reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, suspension or revocation of32certifications or licenses that are requiredto operate our business, injunctions and other associated remedies, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, denialor withdrawal of product clearances, or private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name ofthe government, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business. If we or others determine that any of our existing customerrelationships do not comply with applicable laws and regulations, either due to changes in such laws and regulations or evolvinginterpretations of such laws and regulations, we may be required to renegotiate or terminate such relationships. Any penalties,damages, fines, exclusions, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our businessand our financial results. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of these lawsare broad and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Any action against us for violation of these laws, evenif we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attentionfrom the operation of our business. Other risks relating to our business If we fail to maintain or monitor our information systems ourbusinesses could be adversely affected. We depend on information systems throughout our Company to controlour Life Science manufacturing, inventory, distribution and website and the Clinical Lab processes for: processing specimens, managinginventory, processing test results and submitting claims, collecting from insurers and patients, responding to inquiries, contributingto our overall internal control processes, maintaining records of our property, plant and equipment, and recording and paying amountsdue vendors and other creditors. If we were to experience a prolonged disruption in our information systems that involve interactionswith customers and suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and/or increased costs, which could adverselyaffect our business. Cyber security risks and the failure tomaintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of our computer hardware, software, and Internet applications and relatedtools and functions could result in damage to the Company’s reputation and/or subject the Company to costs, fines, or lawsuits. The integrity and protection of our own data, and that of its customersand employees, is critical to the Company’s business. The regulatory environment governing information, security and privacylaws is increasingly demanding and continues to evolve. Maintaining compliance with applicable security and privacy regulationsmay increase the Company’s operating costs and/or adversely impact the Company’s ability to market its products andservices to customers. Although the Company’s computer and communications hardware is protected through physical and softwaresafeguards, it is still vulnerable to fire, storm, flood, power loss, earthquakes, telecommunications failures, physical or softwarebreak-ins, software viruses, and similar events. These events could lead to the unauthorized access, disclosure and use of non-publicinformation. The techniques used by criminal elements to attack computer systems are sophisticated, change frequently and may originatefrom less regulated and remote areas of the world. As a result, the Company may not be able to address these techniques proactivelyor implement adequate preventative measures. If the Company’s computer systems are compromised, it could be subject to fines,damages, litigation, and enforcement actions, customers could curtail or cease using its applications, and the Company could losetrade secrets, the occurrence of which could harm its business. If we fail to attract and retain key personnel, including oursenior management, our business could be adversely affected. Most of our products and services are highly technical in nature.In general, only highly qualified and trained scientists and technician personnel have the necessary skills to develop proprietarytechnological products and market our products, support our research and development programs and provide our Clinical Lab services. In addition, some of our manufacturing, quality control, safetyand compliance, information technology and e-commerce related positions are highly technical as well. Further, our sales personnelhighly trained and are important to retaining and growing our businesses. Our success depends in large part upon our ability toidentify, hire, retain and motivate highly skilled professionals. We face intense competition for these professionals from our competitors,customers, marketing partners and other companies throughout the industries in which we compete. Since our inception we have successfullyrecruited and hired qualified key employees. Any failure on our part to hire, train, and retain a sufficient number of qualifiedprofessionals would seriously damage our business. We depend heavily on the services of our senior management. We believethat our future success depends on the continued services of such management. Our business may be harmed by the loss of a significantnumber of our senior management in a short period of time.33The insurance we purchase to cover our potential business riskmay be inadequate. Although we believe that our present insurance coverage is sufficientto cover our current estimated exposures, we cannot assure that we will not incur losses or liabilities in excess of our policylimits. In addition, although we believe that will be able to continue to obtain adequate coverage, we cannot assure that we willbe able to do so at acceptable costs. Risks relating to our international operations Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affectour business. Since we operate as a multinational corporation that sells and sourcesproducts in many different countries, changes in exchange rates could in the future, adversely affect our cash flows and resultsof operations. Furthermore, reported sales and purchases made in non-U.S. currenciesby our international businesses, when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes, fluctuate due to exchangerate movement. Due to the number of currencies involved, the variability of currency exposures and the potential volatility ofcurrency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on future sales and operating results. We are subject to economic, political and other risks associatedwith our significant international business, which could adversely affect our financial results. We operate internationally primarily through wholly-owned subsidiarieslocated in North America and Europe. Revenues outside the United States were approximately 10% of total revenues in fiscal 2015.Our sales and earnings could be adversely affected by a variety of factors resulting from our international operations, including •future fluctuations in exchange rates;  •complex regulatory requirements and changes in those requirements;  •trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;  •multiple jurisdictions and differing tax laws, as well as changes in those laws;  •restrictions on our ability to repatriate investments and earnings from foreign operations;  •changes in the political or economic conditions in a country or region, particularly in developing or emerging markets;  •changes in shipping costs; and  •difficulties in collecting on accounts receivable. If any of these risks materialize, we could face substantial increasesin costs, the reduction of profit and the inability to do business. As we expand our commercialization activities outside of theUnited States, we will be subject to an increased risk of inadvertently conducting activities in a manner that violates the U.S.Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws. If that occurs, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties which could havea material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”),which prohibits corporations and individuals from paying, offering to pay, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to anyforeign government official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retainbusiness or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. We are also subject to the UK Anti-Bribery Act, whichprohibits both domestic and international bribery, as well as bribery across both public and private sectors. In the course of establishing and expanding our commercial operationsand seeking regulatory approvals outside of the United States, we will need to establish and expand business relationships withvarious third parties and we will interact more frequently with foreign officials, including regulatory authorities. Expanded programsto maintain compliance with such laws will be costly and may not be effective. Any interactions with any such parties or individualswhere compensation is provided that are found to be in violation of such laws could result in substantial fines and penalties andcould materially harm our business. Furthermore, any finding of a34violation under one country’s laws may increase the likelihoodthat we will be prosecuted and be found to have violated another country’s laws. If our business practices outside the UnitedStates are found to be in violation of the FCPA, UK Anti-Bribery Act or other similar law, we may be subject to significant civiland criminal penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Risks Relating to our Common Stock Our stock price has been volatile, which could result in substantiallosses for investors. Our common stock is quoted on the New York Stock Exchange, and therehas been historical volatility in the market price of our common stock. The trading price of our common stock has been, and islikely to continue to be, subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors, including: •fluctuations in our quarterly operating and earnings per share results;  •the gain or loss of significant contracts;  •the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets;  •loss of key personnel;  •announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors;  •delays in the development and introduction of new products;  •legislative or regulatory changes;  •general trends in the industries we operate;  •recommendations and/or changes in estimates by equity and market research analysts;  •biological or medical discoveries;  •disputes and/or developments concerning intellectual property, including patents and litigation matters;  •public concern as to the safety of new technologies;  •sales of common stock of existing holders;  •securities class action or other litigation;  •developments in our relationships with current or future customers and suppliers and;  •general economic conditions, both in the United States and worldwide. In addition, the stock market in general has experienced extremeprice and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of our common stock, as well as the stock of many companies inour industries. Often, price fluctuations are unrelated to operating performance of the specific companies whose stock is affected. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market priceof a company’s stock, securities class action litigation has occurred against the issuing company. If we were subject tothis type of litigation in the future, we could incur substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention andresources, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings. Any adverse determination in this typeof litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities. Because we do not intend to pay cash dividends on our commonstock, an investor in our common stock will benefit only if it appreciates in value. We currently intend to retain our retained earnings and future earnings,if any, to finance the expansion of our business and do not expect to pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeablefuture. As a result, the success of an investment in our35common stock will depend entirely upon any future appreciation. Thereis no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which investors purchased their shares. It may be difficult for a third party to acquire us, which couldinhibit stockholders from realizing a premium on their stock price. We are subject to the New York anti-takeover laws regulating corporatetakeovers. These anti-takeover laws prohibit certain business combinations between a New York corporation and any “interestedshareholder” (generally, the beneficial owner of 20% or more of the corporation’s voting shares) for five years followingthe time that the shareholder became an interested shareholder, unless the corporation’s board of directors approved thetransaction prior to the interested shareholder becoming interested. Our certificate of incorporation, as amended, and by-laws containprovisions that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us that stockholders may considerfavorable or beneficial. These provisions could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to electdirectors and take other corporate actions. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to payin the future for shares of our common stock. These provisions include: •a staggered board of directors, so that it would take three successive annual meetings to replace all directors; and  •advance notice requirements for the submission by stockholders of nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting. Future sales of shares of our common stock or the issuance ofsecurities senior to our common stock could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our ability to raise fundsin new equity offerings. We are not restricted from issuing additional common stock, preferredstock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock. Future sales of a substantial number of our shares of commonstock or equity-related securities in the public market or privately, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adverselyaffect prevailing trading prices of our common stock, and could impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings ofequity or equity-related securities. No prediction can be made as to the effect, if any, that future sales of shares of commonstock or the availability of shares of common stock for future sale will have on the trading price of our common stock. Risk relating to our debt Our use of leverage may expose us to substantial risks, includinginterest rate risk. As of July 31, 2015 and 2014, we had $3.0 million in borrowingsunder our Revolving Loan and Security Agreement (“credit agreement”). In addition, we may incur additional indebtednessin the future. Accordingly, we are exposed to the typical risks associated with the use of leverage. Increased leverage makes itmore difficult for us to withstand adverse economic conditions or business plan variances, to take advantage of new business opportunities,or to make necessary capital expenditures. The existing credit agreement contains restrictive covenant restrictions that limitour ability to conduct our business, including restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness. Our ability to maintainour compliance with these covenants is dependent on our financial performance, which is influenced by a number of factors. Violationof any of these covenants would result in an event of default under the credit agreement. Upon the occurrence of an event of defaultthat is not cured or waived, the lender would have the ability to accelerate the repayment of all amounts then outstanding underthe credit agreement. In the event of a default, and during the continuance of an event of default under the credit agreement,we would no longer have the right to borrow additional funds under the credit agreement. Under these circumstances, we may notbe able to pay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. Our credit agreement requires the payment of interest based on 3month LIBOR plus a fixed rate. Fluctuations in this variable interest rate could negatively impact our financial results.36"
13,ENZ,ENZO BIOCHEM INC,2014-10-09,"Risk Factors
 Risks relating to our Company and our industries We have experienced significant losses in our last five fiscalyears and quarter to quarter over such periods and our losses have resulted in the use of cash in operations. If such losses andcash uses continue, the value of your investment could decline significantly. We incurred net losses of $10.0 million, $18.2 million, and$39.3 million, inclusive of a non-cash impairment charge of $22.4 million net of tax of $2.1 million (See Note 2,to the ConsolidatedFinancial Statements) for the fiscal years ended July 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. If our revenues do not increase, orif our operating expenses exceed expectations or cannot be reduced, we will continue to suffer substantial losses and use cashin operations which could have an adverse effect on our business and adversely affect your investment in our Company. We may need additional capital to fund growth, which maynot be available on acceptable terms or at all, and could result in our business plan being limited and our business being harmed. Our ability to increase revenue and improve profitability andliquidity will depend in part on our ability to grow the Enzo Life Science business with higher margin products and increase ourmarket share and continue to grow the Enzo Clinical Lab business with new tests with higher reimbursements and increase our servicevolume which may require significant additional capital that may not be available to us. We may need additional financing due tofuture developments, changes in our business plan or failure of our current business plan to succeed, which could result from increasedmarketing, distribution or research and development costs. Our actual funding requirements could vary materially from our currentestimates. If additional financing is needed, we may not be able to raise sufficient funds on favorable terms or at all. If weissue common stock or securities convertible into common stock in the future, such issuance will result in the then-existing stockholderssustaining dilution to their relative proportion of our outstanding equity. If we fail to obtain any necessary financing on a timelybasis, then our ability to execute our current business plan may be limited, and our business, liquidity and financial conditioncould be harmed. Our operating results may vary from period to period. Our operating results may vary significantly from quarter toquarter and from year to year, depending on a variety of factors including: •competitive conditions, including changes in third-party reimbursements;  •health care reform regulations affecting providers and plan sponsors;  •changes in reimbursement policies from third party payers;  •exchange rate fluctuations;  •changes in tax laws, the results of tax audits or the measurement of tax uncertainties;  •the timing of our research and development, sales and marketing expenses;  •the introduction of new products by us or our competitors;  •the success of identifying, acquiring and integrating businesses that complement our product offerings, add new technology or add presence in a market;  •expenses associated with defending our intellectual property portfolio;  •customer demand for our products due to changes in purchasing requirements and research needs;  •general worldwide economic conditions affecting funding of research and  •seasonal fluctuations affected by weather and holiday periods. Consequently, results for any interim period may not necessarilybe indicative of results in subsequent periods.23A significant proportion of our sales are to academic centers,funded by government grants in our major markets globally. Governments around the world have been reviewing long term publicfunding of life science research in response to the problems arising from global financial pressures. As a result, the availablefunds for discretionary purchases from market to market have been capped or reduced based on available National budgets. Reducedgrants for researchers could impact our business, in the amount, price and type of products bought and used by customers. A significant proportion of our sales are to customers inPharmaceutical and Biotech companies. Globally, pharmaceutical companies are challenging internalbudgets, and the return of investment from their R&D spend. This could impact our business, in the amount, price and type ofproducts bought and used by customers. Our future success will depend in part upon our ability toenhance existing products and to develop and introduce new products. The market for our products is characterized by rapidly changingtechnology, evolving industry standards and new product introductions, which may make our existing products obsolete. Our future success will depend in part upon our ability to enhanceexisting products and to develop and introduce new products. The development of new or enhanced products is a complex anduncertain process requiring the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends as well as precise technological execution.In addition, the successful development of new products will depend on the development of new technologies. We will be requiredto undertake time-consuming and costly development activities and to seek regulatory approval for these new products. We may experiencedifficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of these new products. Regulatoryclearance or approval of any new products may not be granted by the FDA, state-wide agency or foreign regulatory authorities ona timely basis, or at all, and the new products may not be successfully commercialized. We may be unable to identify, acquire and integrate acquisitiontargets. In the past six fiscal years we have made significant acquisitionsin our Life Sciences segment. Our strategy envisions, if an opportunistic target is identified, future growth from acquiring andintegrating similar operations and/or product lines. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisitioncandidates and, once identified, to negotiate successfully their acquisition at a price or on terms and conditions favorable tous, or to integrate the operations of such acquired businesses with the existing operations. In addition, we compete for acquisitioncandidates with other entities, some of which have greater financial resources than ours. Our failure to implement successfullyits acquisition strategy would limit our potential growth. Our inability to carry out certain of our marketing and salesplans may make it difficult for us to grow or maintain our business. The Life Sciences segment continues a marketing program designedto more directly service its end users, while simultaneously promoting the Enzo Life Science brand, with reference to our acquiredbrands. We will continue to reach out to our customers using our direct field sales force, in house business team, the on-goingenhancement of our interactive websites, continued attendance at top industry trade meetings, and publications to customers andin leading scientific journals. In addition to our direct sales, we operate worldwide through wholly-owned subsidiaries (in USA,Switzerland, Belgium, Germany, and the UK), a branch office in France and a network of third-party distributors in most other significantmarkets. If we are unable to successfully continue these programs, we may be unable to grow and our business could suffer. We face intense competition, which could cause us to decreasethe prices for our products or services or render our products uneconomical or obsolete, any of which could reduce our revenuesand limit our growth. Our competitors in the biotechnology industry in the UnitedStates and abroad are numerous and include major pharmaceutical, energy, food and chemical companies, as well as specialized geneticengineering firms. Many of our large competitors have substantially greater resources than us and have the capability of developingproducts which compete directly with our products. Many of these companies are performing research in the same areas as we are.The markets for our products are also subject to competitive risks because markets are highly price competitive. Our competitorshave competed in the past by lowering prices on certain products. The clinical laboratory business ishighly fragmented and intensely competitive, and we compete with numerous national and local companies. Some of these entitiesare larger than we are and have greater resources than we do. We compete primarily on the basis of the quality of our testing,reporting and information services, our reputation in the medical community, the pricing of our services and our ability to employqualified professionals.24These competitive conditions could, among other things: •Require us to reduce our prices to retain market share;  •Require us to increase our marketing efforts which could reduce our profit margins;  •Increase our cost of labor to attract qualified personnel;  •Render our biotechnology products uneconomical or obsolete or;  •Reduce our revenue. Ethical, legal and social concerns surrounding the use ofgenetic information could reduce demand for our products. Genetic testing has raised ethical issues regarding privacyand the appropriate uses of the resulting information. For these reasons, governmental authorities may call for limits on or regulationof the use of genetic testing or prohibit testing for genetic predisposition to certain conditions, particularly for those thathave no known cure. Similarly, such concerns may lead individuals to refuse to use genetics tests even if permissible. Any of thesescenarios could reduce the potential markets for our molecular diagnostic products, which could have a material adverse effecton our business, financial condition and results of operations. We depend on distributors and contract manufacturers andsuppliers for materials that could impair our ability to manufacture or distribute our products. Outside distributors, suppliers and contract manufacturers providekey finished goods, components and raw materials used in the sale and manufacture of our products. Our Life Sciences segment distributesproduct for over 40 unrelated third party manufacturers, and own brand products from large numbers of suppliers. To the extentwe are unable to maintain or replace a distributor in a reasonable time period, or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all,our operations could be disrupted. Although we believe that alternative sources for components and raw materials are available,any supply interruption in a limited or sole source component or raw material would harm our ability to manufacture our productsuntil a new source of supply is identified and qualified. In addition, an uncorrected defect or supplier’s variation in acomponent or raw material, either unknown to us or incompatible with our manufacturing process, could harm our ability to manufactureproducts. We might not be able to find a sufficient alternative supplier in a reasonable time period, or on commercially reasonableterms, if at all. If we fail to obtain a supplier for the components of our products, our operations could be disrupted. We use hazardous materials in our business. Any claims relatingto improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials could be costly and time-consuming. Our manufacturing, clinical laboratory and research and developmentprocesses involve the storage, use and disposal of hazardous substances, including hazardous chemicals, biological hazardous materialsand radioactive compounds. We are subject to governmental regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposalof materials and waste products. Although we believe that our safety and environmental management practices and procedures forhandling and disposing of these hazardous materials are in accordance with good industry practice and comply with applicable laws,permits, licenses and regulations, the risk of accidental environmental or human contamination or injury from the release or exposureof hazardous materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for any damages thatresult, including environmental clean-up or decontamination costs, and any such liability could exceed the limits of, or fall outsidethe coverage of, our insurance. We may not be able to maintain insurance on acceptable terms,or at all. We could be required to incur significant costs to comply with current or future environmental and public and workplacesafety and health laws and regulations. We are required to expend significant resources for researchand development for our products in development and these products may not be developed successfully. Failure to successfully developthese products may prevent us from earning a return on our research and development expenditures. The products we are developing are at various stages of developmentand clinical evaluations and may require further technical development and investment to determine whether commercial applicationis practicable. There can be no assurance that our efforts will result in products with valuable commercial applications. Our cashrequirements may vary materially from current estimates because of results of our research and development programs, competitiveand technological advances and other factors. In any event, we will require substantial funds to conduct development activitiesand pre-clinical and clinical trials, apply for regulatory approvals and commercialize products, if any, that are developed.25We do not have any commitments or arrangements to obtain anyadditional financing and there is no assurance that required financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.Even if we spend substantial amounts on research and development, our potential products may not be developed successfully. If our product candidates on which we have expended significantamounts for research and development are not commercialized, we will not earn a return on our research and development expenditures,which may harm our business. Risks relating to our Intellectual Property and RegulatoryApproval Protecting our proprietary rights is difficult and costly.If we fail to adequately protect or enforce our proprietary rights, we could lose potential revenue from licensing and royalties. Our potential revenue and success depends in large part on ourability to obtain, maintain and enforce our patents. Our ability to commercialize any product successfully will largely dependon our ability to obtain and maintain patents of sufficient scope to prevent third parties from developing similar or competitiveproducts. In the absence of patent protection, competitors may impactour business by developing and marketing substantially equivalent products and technology. Patent disputes are frequent and can preclude the commercializationof products. We have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be, involved in material patent litigation, such asthe matters discussed under “Part I - Item 3. Legal Proceedings” in this report. Patent protection litigation is time-consumingand we have incurred and anticipate continuing to incur significant legal costs. In addition, an adverse decision could force usto either obtain third-party licenses at a material cost or cease using the technology or product in dispute. We have filed applications for United States and foreign patentscovering certain aspects of our technology, but there is no assurance that pending patents will issue or as to the degree of protectionwhich any issued patent might afford. Lawsuits, including patent infringements, in the biotechnologyindustry are not uncommon. If we become involved in any significant litigation, we would suffer as a result of the diversion ofour management’s attention, the expense of litigation and any judgments against us. In addition to intellectual property litigation for infringement,other substantial, complex or extended litigation could result in large expenditures by us and distraction of our management. Patentlitigation is time-consuming and costly in its own right and could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties. In addition,an adverse decision could force us to either obtain third-party licenses at a material cost or cease using the technology or productin dispute. In addition, lawsuits by employees, stockholders, collaborators or distributors could be very costly and substantiallydisrupt our business. Disputes from time to time with companies or individuals are not uncommon in the biotechnology industry,and we cannot assure you that we will always be able to resolve them out of court. We also utilize certain unpatented proprietary technology andno assurance can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary technology, that suchproprietary technology will not be disclosed or that we can meaningfully protect our rights to such proprietary technology. We may incur impairment charges on our goodwill and intangibleswhich would reduce our earnings. We are subject to Statement of Financial Accounting StandardsASC 350, “Intangibles, Goodwill and Other (“ASC 350”) which requires that goodwill and other intangible assetsthat have an indefinite life be tested at least annually for impairment. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite livesmust also be tested for impairment between the annual tests if a triggering event occurs that would likely reduce the fair valueof the asset below its carrying amount. As of July 31, 2014 and 2013, goodwill and intangible assetsrepresented approximately 24% and 30%, respectively, of our total assets. During the fiscal 2012 fourth quarter we recorded impairmentson our indefinite-lived intangibles of $5.7 million and our goodwill of $18.8 million in our Life Science segment. The aggregatenon-cash charge of $24.5 million did not impact the Company’s consolidated cash flows, liquidity and capital resources (SeeNote 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). If we determine that there has been impairment, our financial results for therelevant period would be reduced by the amount of the impairment, net of tax effects, if any. The Company has no intangible assetswith indefinite lives.26We may be unable to obtain or maintain regulatory approvalsfor our products, which could reduce our revenue or prevent us from earning a return on our research and development expenditures. Our research, preclinical development, clinical trials, productmanufacturing and marketing are subject to regulation by the FDA and similar health authorities in foreign countries. FDA approvalis required for our products, as well as the manufacturing processes and facilities, if any, used to produce our products thatmay be sold in the United States. The process of obtaining approvals from the FDA is costly, time consuming and often subject tounanticipated delays. Even if regulatory approval is granted, such approval may include significant limitations on indicated usesfor which any products could be marketed. Further, even if such regulatory approvals are obtained, a marketed product and its manufacturerare subject to continued review, and later discovery of previously unknown problems may result in restrictions on such productor manufacturer, including withdrawal of the product from the market. New government regulations in the United States or foreign countriesalso may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development. Further, because genetherapy is a relatively new technology and has not been extensively tested in humans, the regulatory requirements governing genetherapy products are uncertain and may be subject to substantial further review by various regulatory authorities in the UnitedStates and abroad. This uncertainty may result in extensive delays in initiating clinical trials and in the regulatory approvalprocess. Our failure to obtain regulatory approval of our proposed products, processes or facilities could have a material adverseeffect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The proposed products under development may also be subjectto certain other federal, state and local government regulations, including, but not limited to, the Federal Food, Drug and CosmeticAct, the Environmental Protection Act, and Occupational Safety and Health Act, and state, local and foreign counterparts to certainof such acts. We cannot be sure that we can obtain necessary regulatory approvalson a timely basis, if at all, for any of the products we are developing or manufacturing or that we can maintain necessary regulatoryapprovals for our existing products, and all of the following could have a material adverse effect on our business: •significant delays in obtaining or failing to obtain required approvals;  •loss of, or changes to, previously obtained approvals;  •failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements and;  •changes to manufacturing processes, manufacturing process standards or Good Manufacturing Practices following approval or changing interpretations of these factors. Adverse perception and increased regulatory scrutiny of genemedicine and genetic research might limit our ability to conduct our business. Ethical, social and legal concerns about gene medicine, genetictesting and genetic research could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting the technologies we or our collaboratorsmay use. Recently, gene medicine studies have come under increasing scrutiny, which has delayed ongoing and could delay futureclinical trials and regulatory approvals. Federal and state agencies, congressional committees and foreign governments have expressedinterest in further regulating biotechnology. More restrictive regulations or claims that our products are unsafe or pose a hazardcould prevent us from commercializing any products. Risks relating to our Clinical Labs services segment Our clinical laboratory business is subject to extensivegovernment regulation and our loss of any required certifications or licenses could require us to cease operating this part ofour business, which would reduce our revenue and injure our reputation. The clinical laboratory industry is subject to significant governmentalregulation at the Federal, state and local levels. Under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act of 1967 and the Clinical LaboratoryImprovement Amendments of 1988 (collectively, as amended, “CLIA”) virtually all clinical laboratories, including ours,must be certified by the Federal government. Many clinical laboratories also must meet other governmental standards, undergo proficiencytesting and are subject to inspection. Certifications or licenses are also required by various state and local laws. The failureof our clinical laboratory to obtain or maintain such certifications or licenses under these laws could interrupt our ability tooperate our clinical laboratory business and injure our reputation.27Reimbursements from third-party payers, upon which our clinicallaboratory business is dependent, are subject to inconsistent rates and coverage and legislative reform that are beyond our control.This inconsistency and any reform that decreases coverage and rates could reduce our earnings and harm our business. Our clinical laboratory business is primarily dependent uponreimbursement from third-party payers, such as Medicare (which principally serves patients 65 and older) and commercial insurers.We are subject to variances in reimbursement rates among different third-party payers, as well as constant renegotiation of thosereimbursement rates. We also are subject to audit by Medicare and the commercial insurers, which can result in the return of paymentsmade to us under these programs. These variances in reimbursement rates and audit results could reduce our margins and thus ourearnings. The health care industry continues to undergo significant changeas third-party payers’ increase their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of health care services. In aneffort to address the problem of increasing health care costs, legislation has been proposed or enacted at both the Federal andstate levels to regulate health care delivery in general and clinical laboratories in particular. Some of the proposals includemanaged competition, global budgeting and price controls. Changes that decrease reimbursement rates or coverage, or increase administrativeburdens on billing third-party payers could reduce our revenues and increase our expenses. U.S. healthcare reform legislation may result in significantchange and our business could be adversely impacted if we fail to adapt. Government oversight of and attention to the healthcare industryin the United States is significant and increasing. Under the Patient Protections and affordable Care Act, expansion in the poolof covered lives may expand the market for clinical diagnostic testing while at the same time, various policies aimed at reducingcosts or bundling care may reduce the rates paid for such services’ the net impact of these factors on the market for ourtests is not clear. In April 2014, Congress passed the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, which include substantial changesto the way in which clinical laboratory services will be paid under Medicare. Beginning in 2017, Medicare payments for clinicallaboratory services will be paid based upon private payer rates reported by clinical laboratories across the US replacing the currentsystem, which is based upon fee schedules derived from historical charges for test from approximately 30 years ago. The impactof the new payment system on rates for tests we perform or our customers’ tests that may use our products is not clear atthis time. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act also imposesan excise tax on the seller for the sale of certain medical devices in the United States, including those purchased and used bylaboratories, beginning in 2013. The legislation also establishes the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which will be responsible,beginning in 2014, annually to submit proposals aimed at reducing Medicare cost growth while preserving quality. If the projectedgrowth in per capita Medicare costs exceeds a specified target level, the IPAB must submit proposals to reduce or eliminate thedifference. For calendar years 2015 through 2019, the target growth rate is the projected average of the increases in the ConsumerPrice Index and the medical care expenditure category of the Consumer Price Index; for 2020 and thereafter, the target growth rateis the rate of increase in gross domestic product per capita plus one percentage point. If it is necessary for the IPAB to submitproposals, they will automatically be implemented unless Congress enacts alternative proposals that achieve the same savings targets. Further, the legislation calls for a Center for Medicare andMedicaid Innovation that will examine alternative payment methodologies and conduct demonstration programs. The legislation providesfor extensive health insurance reforms, including the elimination of pre-existing condition exclusions and other limitations oncoverage, fixed percentages on medical loss ratios, expansion in Medicaid and other programs, employer mandates, individual mandates,creation of state and regional health insurance exchanges, and tax subsidies for individuals to help cover the cost of individualinsurance coverage. The legislation also permits the establishment of accountable care organizations, a new healthcare deliverymodel. While the ultimate impact of the legislation on the healthcare industry is unknown, it is likely to be extensive and mayresult in significant change. Our failure to adapt to these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business. Changes in provider mix, including continued growth in capitatedmanaged-cost health care and changes in certain third party provider agreements could have a material adverse impact on the Company’snet revenues and profitability. Certain third party provider companies have adopted nationaland regional programs which include multiple managed-care reimbursement models. If the Company is unable to participate in theseprograms or if the Company would lose a material contract, it could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s net revenuesand profitability.28The number of individuals covered under managed care contractsor other similar arrangements has grown over the past several years and may continue to grow in the future. In addition, Medicareand other government healthcare programs may continue to shift to managed care. Entities providing managed care coverage have reducedpayments for medical services, including clinical laboratory services, in numerous ways such as entering into arrangements underwhich payments to a service provider are capitated, limiting testing to specified procedures, denying payment for services performedwithout prior authorization and refusing to increase fees for specified services. These trends reduce our revenues and limit ourability to pass cost increases to our customers. Also, if these or other managed care organizations do not select us as a participatingprovider, we may lose some or all of that business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition andresults of operations. Because of competitive pressures, impacts of the economyon patient traffic at our customers and the complexity and expense of the billing process in our clinical laboratory business,we must obtain new customers while maintaining existing customers to grow our business. Intense competition in the clinical laboratory business, increasingadministrative burdens upon the reimbursement process, reduced patient traffic, and reduced coverage and payments by insurers makeit necessary for us to increase our volume of laboratory services. To do so, we must obtain new customers while retaining existingcustomers. Our failure to attract new customers or the loss of existingcustomers or a reduction in business from those customers could significantly reduce our revenues and impede our ability to grow. Compliance with Medicare administrative policies, includingthose pertaining to certain automated blood chemistry profiles, may reduce the reimbursements we receive. Containment of health care costs, including reimbursement forclinical laboratory services, has been a focus of ongoing governmental activity. Clinical laboratories must bill Medicare directlyfor the services provided to Medicare beneficiaries and may only collect the amounts permitted under this fee schedule. Reimbursementto clinical laboratories under the Medicare Fee Schedule has been steadily declining since its inception. Because a significantportion of our costs is fixed, these Medicare reimbursement reductions and changes have a direct adverse effect on our net earningsand cash flows. The development of new, more cost-effective tests that canbe performed by our customers or by patients, and the continued internalization of testing by hospitals or physicians, could negativelyimpact our testing volume and revenues. The diagnostic industry is faced with changing technology andnew product introductions, including technology that enables more convenient or cost-effective testing. Some of our competitorsalso may offer testing to be performed outside of a commercial clinical laboratory, such as point-of-care testing that can be performedby physicians in their offices; complex testing that can be performed by hospitals in their own laboratories; and home testingthat can be carried out without requiring the services of outside providers. Advances in technology also may lead to the need forless frequent testing. Further, diagnostic tests approved or cleared by the FDA for home use are automatically deemed to be “waived”tests under CLIA and may be performed by patients in their homes; test kit manufacturers could seek to increase sales to patientsof such test kits. Development of such technology and its use by our customers would reduce the demand for our laboratory-basedtesting services and negatively impact our revenues. Our business could be harmed from the loss or suspensionof a license or imposition of a fine or penalties under, or future changes in, or changing interpretations of, CLIA or state laboratorylicensing laws to which we are subject. The clinical laboratory testing industry is subject to extensivefederal and state regulation, and many of these statutes and regulations have not been interpreted by the courts. The ClinicalLaboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA, are federal regulatory standards that apply to virtually all clinical laboratories(regardless of the location, size or type of laboratory), including those operated by physicians in their offices, by requiringthat they be certified by the federal government or by a federally approved accreditation agency. CLIA does not preempt state law,which in some cases may be more stringent than federal law and require additional personnel qualifications, quality control, recordmaintenance and proficiency testing. The sanction for failure to comply with CLIA and state requirements may be suspension, revocationor limitation of a laboratory’s CLIA certificate, which is necessary to conduct business, as well as significant fines and/orcriminal penalties. Several states have similar laws and we may be subject to similar penalties. We cannot assure that applicable statutes and regulations willnot be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that would adversely affect ourbusiness. Potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations include significant fines and the suspension or lossof various licenses, certificates and authorizations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition,compliance with future legislation could impose additional requirements on us, which may be costly.29Regulations requiring the use of “standard transactions”for healthcare services may negatively impact our profitability and cash flows. The administrative simplification provisions of the Health InsurancePortability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its implementing regulations, or HIPAA, were designed to improve the efficiencyand effectiveness of the healthcare system by facilitating the electronic exchange of information in certain financial and administrativetransactions while protecting the privacy and security of the information exchanged. The administrative simplification provisionsaddress standards for electronic transactions, security regulations and privacy regulations. The HIPAA transaction standards are complex, and subject todifferences in interpretation by payers. For instance, some payers may interpret the standards to require us to provide certaintypes of information, including demographic information not usually provided to us by physicians. While most of our transactionsare submitted and/or received in ANSI standard format, inconsistent application of transaction standards by some remaining payersor our inability to obtain certain billing information not usually provided to us by physicians could increase our costs and thecomplexity of billing. In addition, new requirements for additional standard transactions, such as claims attachments, could provetechnically difficult, time-consuming or expensive to implement. We are working closely with our payers to establish acceptableprotocols for claims submissions and with our industry trade association and an industry coalition to present issues and problemsas they arise to the appropriate regulators and standards setting organizations. Compliance with the HIPAA security, privacy and breach notificationregulations and privacy regulations may increase our costs. The HIPAA privacy and security and breach notification regulationsestablish comprehensive federal standards with respect to the uses and disclosures PHI by Covered Entities. These regulations wererecently amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, orHITECH, to, among other things directly apply to business associates (i.e., individuals or entities who create, receive, maintainor transmit PHI on behalf of a Covered Entity in performing functions or activities regulated by HIPAA or who perform certain services,other than treatment, on behalf of Covered Entities and receive PHI in order to perform such services) with regard to certain requirements.The regulations also specify that business associates include subcontractors that create, receive, maintain or transmit PHI onbehalf of a business associate. The regulations establish a complex regulatory framework on a variety of subjects, including:  §the circumstances under which uses and disclosures of PHI are permitted or required without a specific authorization by the patient, including but not limited to treatment purposes, activities to obtain payments for our services, and our healthcare operations activities;    §a patient’s rights to access, amend and receive an accounting of certain disclosures of PHI;    §requirements to notify individuals if there is a breach of their PHI;    §the requirements for business associates and the terms of business associate agreements;    §the content of notices of privacy practices for protected health information and;    §administrative, technical and physical safeguards required of entities that use or receive PHI. We have implemented practices to meet the requirements of theHIPAA privacy, security and breach notification regulations, and updated these practices to comply with HITECH. HIPAA establishesa “floor” and does not supersede state laws that are more stringent. Therefore, we are required to comply with bothfederal privacy, security and breach notification regulations and varying state privacy, security and breach notification lawsand regulations. In addition, for healthcare data transfers from other countries relating to citizens of those countries, we mustcomply with the laws of those other countries. The federal privacy regulations restrict our ability to use or disclose patient-identifiablelaboratory data, without patient authorization, for purposes other than payment, treatment, healthcare operations and certain otherspecified disclosures such as public health and governmental oversight of the health care industry. The privacy, security and breachnotification regulations provide for significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of PHI, including potentialcivil and criminal fines and penalties. Although the HIPAA statute and regulations do not expressly provide for a private rightof damages, we also could incur damages under state laws to private parties for the wrongful use or disclosure of confidentialhealth information or other private personal information. Compliance with all of the HIPAA regulations, including standardtransactions, requires ongoing resources from all healthcare organizations, not just clinical laboratories. While we believe ourtotal costs to comply with HIPAA will not be material to our operations or cash flows, new standard transactions and additionalcustomer requirements resulting from different interpretations of the current regulations could impose additional costs on us.30FDA regulation of laboratory-developed tests, analyte specificreagents, or genetic testing could lead to increased costs and delays in introducing new genetic tests. The FDA has regulatory responsibility overinstruments, test kits, reagents and other devices used to perform diagnostic testing by clinical laboratories. In the past,the FDA has claimed regulatory authority over laboratory-developed tests, but has exercised enforcement discretion in notregulating tests performed by high complexity CLIA-certified laboratories. However, on July 31, 2014, the FDA issued a 60-daynotice to Congress indicating that the FDA intends to issue Draft Guidance on the regulation of laboratory-developed tests.In the notice, FDA indicates that it intends to end its policy of general enforcement discretion towards laboratory-developedtests, and proposes the implementation of a risk-based regulatory framework. Under the proposed framework manylaboratory-developed tests would be subject to FDA’s regulations for medical devices, including registrations andlisting premarket review, medical device reports, and quality systems regulations. The implementation of this framework wouldnot begin until after a Final Guidance is issued and would occur over a nine year period with those tests that FDA considersto be highest risk falling under FDA’s review requirements first. On September 30, 2014, the FDA issued draftguidelines and announced a 120 day public comment period on its proposal. In December 2000, the HHS Secretary’s Advisory Committeeon Genetic Testing recommended that the FDA be the lead federal agency to regulate genetic testing. In late 2002, a new HHS Secretary’sAdvisory Committee on Genetics, Health and Society, or SACGHS, was appointed to replace the prior Advisory Committee. Ultimately,SACGHS decided that it would continue to monitor the progress of the federal agencies in the oversight of genetic technologies,but it did not believe that further action was warranted. In the meantime, the FDA is considering revising its regulations on analytespecific reagents, which are used in laboratory-developed tests, including laboratory-developed genetic testing. We cannot predictwhether FDA regulation – including premarket review requirements – will apply to the laboratory-developed tests thatwe perform or the tests in which our customers may use our products. FDA interest in or actual regulation of laboratory-developedtests or increased regulation of the various medical devices used in laboratory-developed testing could lead to increased regulatoryburdens and increased costs and delays in introducing new tests, including genetic tests and decreased demand for our products. In the past, the clinical laboratory industry has received negativepublicity. This publicity has led to increased legislation, regulation, and review of industry practices. These factors may adverselyaffect our ability to market our services, require us to change our services and increase the regulatory burdens under which weoperate, further increasing the costs of doing business and adversely affecting our operating results. If we experience a significantdisruption in our information technology systems, including our website, or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully,our business could be adversely affected. Other risks relating to our business If we fail to maintain or monitor our information systemsour businesses could be adversely affected. We depend on information systems throughout our Company to controlour Life Science manufacturing, inventory, distribution and website and the Clinical Lab processes for: processing orders, managinginventory, processing shipments to and collecting cash from our customers, responding to customer inquiries, contributing to ouroverall internal control processes, maintaining records of our property, plant and equipment, and recording and paying amountsdue vendors and other creditors. If we were to experience a prolonged disruption in our information systems that involve interactionswith customers and suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and/or increased costs, which could adverselyaffect our business. If we fail to attract and retain key personnel, includingour senior management, our business could be adversely affected. Most of our products and services are highly technical in nature.In general, only highly qualified and trained scientists and technician personnel have the necessary skills to develop proprietarytechnological products and market our products, support our research and development programs and provide our Clinical Lab services. In addition, some of our manufacturing, quality control, safetyand compliance, information technology and e-commerce related positions are highly technical as well. Further, our sales personnelhighly trained and are important to retaining and growing our businesses. Our success depends in large part upon our ability toidentify, hire, retain and motivate highly skilled professionals. We face intense competition for these professionals from ourcompetitors, customers, marketing partners and other companies throughout the industries in which we compete. Since our inceptionwe have successfully recruited and hired qualified key employees. Any failure on our part to hire, train, and retain a sufficientnumber of qualified professionals would seriously damage our business. We depend heavily on the services of our senior management.We believe that our future success depends on the continued services of such management. Our business may be harmed by the lossof a significant number of our senior management in a short period of time.31The insurance we purchase to cover our potential businessrisk may be inadequate. Although we believe that our present insurance coverage is sufficientto cover our current estimated exposures, we cannot assure that we will not incur liabilities in excess of our policy limits. Inaddition, although we believe that will be able to continue to obtain adequate coverage, we cannot assure that we will be ableto do so at acceptable costs. Risks relating to our international operations Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may adverselyaffect our business. Since we operate as a multinational corporation that sells andsources products in many different countries, changes in exchange rates could in the future, adversely affect our cash flows andresults of operations. Furthermore, reported sales and purchases made in non-U.S. currenciesby our international businesses, when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes, fluctuate due to exchangerate movement. Due to the number of currencies involved, the variability of currency exposures and the potential volatility ofcurrency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on future sales and operating results. We are subject to economic, political and other risks associatedwith our significant international business, which could adversely affect our financial results. We operate internationally primarily through wholly-owned subsidiarieslocated in North America and Europe. Revenues outside the United States were approximately 12% of total revenues in fiscal 2014.Our sales and earnings could be adversely affected by a variety of factors resulting from our international operations, including •future fluctuations in exchange rates;  •complex regulatory requirements and changes in those requirements;  •trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;  •multiple jurisdictions and differing tax laws, as well as changes in those laws;  •restrictions on our ability to repatriate investments and earnings from foreign operations;  •changes in the political or economic conditions in a country or region, particularly in developing or emerging markets;  •changes in shipping costs; and  •difficulties in collecting on accounts receivable. If any of these risks materialize, we could face substantialincreases in costs, the reduction of profit and the inability to do business. As we expand our commercialization activities outside ofthe United States, we will be subject to an increased risk of inadvertently conducting activities in a manner that violates theU.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws. If that occurs, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties which couldhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. We are subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”),which prohibits corporations and individuals from paying, offering to pay, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to anyforeign government official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retainbusiness or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. We are also subject to the UK Anti-Bribery Act, whichprohibits both domestic and international bribery, as well as bribery across both public and private sectors.32In the course of establishing and expanding our commercial operationsand seeking regulatory approvals outside of the United States, we will need to establish and expand business relationships withvarious third parties and we will interact more frequently with foreign officials, including regulatory authorities. Expanded programsto maintain compliance with such laws will be costly and may not be effective. Any interactions with any such parties or individualswhere compensation is provided that are found to be in violation of such laws could result in substantial fines and penalties andcould materially harm our business. Furthermore, any finding of a violation under one country’s laws may increase the likelihoodthat we will be prosecuted and be found to have violated another country’s laws. If our business practices outside the UnitedStates are found to be in violation of the FCPA, UK Anti-Bribery Act or other similar law, we may be subject to significant civiland criminal penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Risks Relating to our Common Stock Our stock price has been volatile, which could result insubstantial losses for investors. Our common stock is quoted on the New York Stock Exchange, andthere has been historical volatility in the market price of our common stock. The trading price of our common stock has been, andis likely to continue to be, subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors, including: •fluctuations in our quarterly operating and earnings per share results;  •the gain or loss of significant contracts;  •the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets;  •loss of key personnel;  •announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors;  •delays in the development and introduction of new products;  •legislative or regulatory changes;  •general trends in the industries we operate;  •recommendations and/or changes in estimates by equity and market research analysts;  •biological or medical discoveries;  •disputes and/or developments concerning intellectual property, including patents and litigation matters;  •public concern as to the safety of new technologies;  •sales of common stock of existing holders;  •securities class action or other litigation;  •developments in our relationships with current or future customers and suppliers and;  •general economic conditions, both in the United States and worldwide. In addition, the stock market in general has experienced extremeprice and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of our common stock, as well as the stock of many companies inour industries. Often, price fluctuations are unrelated to operating performance of the specific companies whose stock is affected. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market priceof a company’s stock, securities class action litigation has occurred against the issuing company. If we were subject tothis type of litigation in the future, we could incur substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention andresources, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings. Any adverse determination in this typeof litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities.33Because we do not intend to pay cash dividends on our commonstock, an investor in our common stock will benefit only if it appreciates in value. We currently intend to retain our retained earnings and futureearnings, if any, to finance the expansion of our business and do not expect to pay any cash dividends on our common stock in theforeseeable future. As a result, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon any future appreciation.There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which investors purchased theirshares. It may be difficult for a third party to acquire us, whichcould inhibit stockholders from realizing a premium on their stock price. We are subject to the New York anti-takeover laws regulatingcorporate takeovers. These anti-takeover laws prohibit certain business combinations between a New York corporation and any “interestedshareholder” (generally, the beneficial owner of 20% or more of the corporation’s voting shares) for five years followingthe time that the shareholder became an interested shareholder, unless the corporation’s board of directors approved thetransaction prior to the interested shareholder becoming interested. Our certificate of incorporation, as amended, and by-laws containprovisions that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us that stockholders may considerfavorable or beneficial. These provisions could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to electdirectors and take other corporate actions. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to payin the future for shares of our common stock. These provisions include: •a staggered board of directors, so that it would take three successive annual meetings to replace all directors; and  •advance notice requirements for the submission by stockholders of nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting. Future sales of shares of our common stock or the issuanceof securities senior to our common stock could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our ability to raisefunds in new equity offerings. We are not restricted from issuing additional common stock,preferred stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock. Future sales of a substantial number of our sharesof common stock or equity-related securities in the public market or privately, or the perception that such sales could occur,could adversely affect prevailing trading prices of our common stock, and could impair our ability to raise capital through futureofferings of equity or equity-related securities. No prediction can be made as to the effect, if any, that future sales of sharesof common stock or the availability of shares of common stock for future sale will have on the trading price of our common stock. Risk relating to our debt Our use of leverage may expose us to substantial risks, includinginterest rate risk. As of July 31, 2014 and 2013, we had $3.0 and $3.3 million,respectively in borrowings under our Revolving Loan and Security Agreement (“credit agreement”). In addition, we mayincur additional indebtedness in the future. Accordingly, we are exposed to the typical risks associated with the use of leverage.Increased leverage makes it more difficult for us to withstand adverse economic conditions or business plan variances, to takeadvantage of new business opportunities, or to make necessary capital expenditures. The existing credit agreement contains restrictivecovenant restrictions that limit our ability to conduct our business, including restrictions on our ability to incur additionalindebtedness. Our ability to maintain our compliance with these covenants is dependent on our financial performance, which is influencedby a number of factors. Violation of any of these covenants would result in an event of default under the credit agreement. Uponthe occurrence of an event of default that is not cured or waived, the lender would have the ability to accelerate the repaymentof all amounts then outstanding under the credit agreement. In the event of a default, and during the continuance of an event ofdefault under the credit agreement, we would no longer have the right to borrow additional funds under the credit agreement. Underthese circumstances, we may not be able to pay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it on terms that are acceptableto us or at all. Our credit agreement requires the payment of interest basedon 3 month LIBOR plus a fixed rate. Fluctuations in this variable interest rate could negatively impact our financial results.34"
1,ENZ,ENZO BIOCHEM INC,2013-10-15,"Risk Factors
 Risks relating to our Company and our industries We have experienced significant losses in our last five fiscalyears and quarter to quarter over such periods and our losses have resulted in the use of cash in operations. If such losses andcash uses continue, the value of your investment could decline significantly. We incurred net losses of $18.2 million, $39.3 million, inclusiveof a non-cash impairment charge of $22.4 million net of tax of $2.1 million (See Note 2) and $12.9 million for the fiscal yearsended July 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. If our revenues do not increase, or if our operating expenses exceed expectationsor cannot be reduced, we will continue to suffer substantial losses and use cash in operations which could have an adverse effecton our business and adversely affect your investment in our Company. We may need additional capital to fund growth, which may notbe available on acceptable terms or at all, and could result in our business plan being limited and our business being harmed. Our ability to increase revenue and improve profitability andliquidity will depend in part on our ability to grow the Enzo Life Science business with higher margin products and increase ourmarket share and continue to grow the Enzo Clinical Lab business with new tests with higher reimbursements and increase our servicevolume which may require significant additional capital that may not be available to us. We may need additional financing due tofuture developments, changes in our business plan or failure of our current business plan to succeed, which could result from increasedmarketing, distribution or research and development costs. Our actual funding requirements could vary materially from our currentestimates. If additional financing is needed, we may not be able to raise sufficient funds on favorable terms or at all. If weissue common stock or securities convertible into common stock in the future, such issuance will result in the then-existing stockholderssustaining dilution to their relative proportion of our outstanding equity. If we fail to obtain any necessary financing on a timelybasis, then our ability to execute our current business plan may be limited, and our business, liquidity and financial conditioncould be harmed. Our operating results may vary from period to period. Our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarterand from year to year, depending on a variety of factors including: •competitive conditions, including changes in third-party reimbursements;  •health care reform regulations affecting providers and plan sponsors;  •changes in reimbursement policies from third party payers;  •exchange rate fluctuations;  •changes in tax laws, the results of tax audits or the measurement of tax uncertainties;  •the timing of our research and development, sales and marketing expenses;  •the introduction of new products by us or our competitors;  •the success of identifying, acquiring and integrating businesses that complement our product offerings, add new technology or add presence in a market;  •expenses associated with defending our intellectual property portfolio;  •customer demand for our products due to changes in purchasing requirements and research needs;  •general worldwide economic conditions affecting funding of research and  •seasonal fluctuations affected by weather and holiday periods. Consequently, results for any interim period may not necessarilybe indicative of results in subsequent periods. A significant proportion of our sales are to academic centers,funded by government grants in our major markets globally. Governments around the world have been reviewing long term publicfunding of life science research in response to the problems arising from global financial pressures. As a result, the availablefunds for discretionary purchases from market to market have been capped or reduced based on available National budgets. Reducedgrants for researchers could impact our business, in the amount, price and type of products bought and used by customers. A significant proportion of our sales are to customers in Pharmaceuticaland Biotech companies. Globally, pharmaceutical companies are challenging internal budgets,and the return of investment from their R&D spend. This could impact our business, in the amount, price and type of productsbought and used by customers. Our future success will depend in part upon our ability toenhance existing products and to develop and introduce new products. The market for our products is characterized by rapidly changingtechnology, evolving industry standards and new product introductions, which may make our existing products obsolete.28Our future success will depend in part upon our ability to enhanceexisting products and to develop and introduce new products. The development of new or enhanced products is a complex anduncertain process requiring the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends as well as precise technological execution.In addition, the successful development of new products will depend on the development of new technologies. We will be requiredto undertake time-consuming and costly development activities and to seek regulatory approval for these new products. We may experiencedifficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of these new products. Regulatoryclearance or approval of any new products may not be granted by the FDA, state-wide agency or foreign regulatory authorities ona timely basis, or at all, and the new products may not be successfully commercialized. We may be unable to identify, acquire and integrate acquisitiontargets. In the past six fiscal years we have made significant acquisitionsin our Life Sciences segment. Our strategy envisions, if an opportunistic target is identified, future growth from acquiring andintegrating similar operations and/or product lines. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisitioncandidates and, once identified, to negotiate successfully their acquisition at a price or on terms and conditions favorable tous, or to integrate the operations of such acquired businesses with the existing operations. In addition, we compete for acquisitioncandidates with other entities, some of which have greater financial resources than ours. Our failure to implement successfullyits acquisition strategy would limit our potential growth. Our inability to carry out certain of our marketing and salesplans may make it difficult for us to grow or maintain our business. The Life Sciences segment continues a marketing program designedto more directly service its end users, while simultaneously promoting the Enzo Life Science brand, with reference to our acquiredbrands. We will continue to reach out to our customers using our direct field sales force, in house business team, the on-goingenhancement of our interactive websites, continued attendance at top industry trade meetings, and publications to customers andin leading scientific journals. In addition to our direct sales, we operate worldwide through wholly-owned subsidiaries (in USA,Switzerland, Belgium, Germany, and the UK), a branch office in France and a network of third-party distributors in most other significantmarkets. If we are unable to successfully continue these programs, we may be unable to grow and our business could suffer. We face intense competition, which could cause us to decreasethe prices for our products or services or render our products uneconomical or obsolete, any of which could reduce our revenuesand limit our growth. Our competitors in the biotechnology industry in the United Statesand abroad are numerous and include major pharmaceutical, energy, food and chemical companies, as well as specialized genetic engineeringfirms. Many of our large competitors have substantially greater resources than us and have the capability of developing productswhich compete directly with our products. Many of these companies are performing research in the same areas as we are. The marketsfor our products are also subject to competitive risks because markets are highly price competitive. Our competitors have competedin the past by lowering prices on certain products. The clinical laboratory business is highly fragmented and intenselycompetitive, and we compete with numerous national and local companies. Some of these entities are larger than we are and havegreater resources than we do. We compete primarily on the basis of the quality of our testing, reporting and information services,our reputation in the medical community, the pricing of our services and our ability to employ qualified professionals.29These competitive conditions could, among other things: •Require us to reduce our prices to retain market share;  •Require us to increase our marketing efforts which could reduce our profit margins;  •Increase our cost of labor to attract qualified personnel;  •Render our biotechnology products uneconomical or obsolete or;  •Reduce our revenue. We depend on distributors and contract manufacturers and suppliersfor materials that could impair our ability to manufacture or distribute our products. Outside distributors, suppliers and contract manufacturers providekey finished goods, components and raw materials used in the sale and manufacture of our products. Our Life Sciences segment distributesproduct for over 40 unrelated third party manufacturers, and own brand products from large numbers of suppliers. To the extentwe are unable to maintain or replace a distributor in a reasonable time period, or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all,our operations could be disrupted. Although we believe that alternative sources for components and raw materials are available,any supply interruption in a limited or sole source component or raw material would harm our ability to manufacture our productsuntil a new source of supply is identified and qualified. In addition, an uncorrected defect or supplier’s variation in acomponent or raw material, either unknown to us or incompatible with our manufacturing process, could harm our ability to manufactureproducts. We might not be able to find a sufficient alternative supplier in a reasonable time period, or on commercially reasonableterms, if at all. If we fail to obtain a supplier for the components of our products, our operations could be disrupted. We use hazardous materials in our business. Any claims relatingto improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials could be costly and time-consuming. Our manufacturing, clinical laboratory and research and developmentprocesses involve the storage, use and disposal of hazardous substances, including hazardous chemicals, biological hazardous materialsand radioactive compounds. We are subject to governmental regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposalof materials and waste products. Although we believe that our safety and environmental management practices and procedures forhandling and disposing of these hazardous materials are in accordance with good industry practice and comply with applicable laws,permits, licenses and regulations, the risk of accidental environmental or human contamination or injury from the release or exposureof hazardous materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for any damages thatresult, including environmental clean-up or decontamination costs, and any such liability could exceed the limits of, or fall outsidethe coverage of, our insurance. We may not be able to maintain insurance on acceptable terms,or at all. We could be required to incur significant costs to comply with current or future environmental and public and workplacesafety and health laws and regulations. We are required to expend significant resources for researchand development for our products in development and these products may not be developed successfully. Failure to successfully developthese products may prevent us from earning a return on our research and development expenditures. The products we are developing are at various stages of developmentand clinical evaluations and may require further technical development and investment to determine whether commercial applicationis practicable. There can be no assurance that our efforts will result in products with valuable commercial applications. Our cashrequirements may vary materially from current estimates because of results of our research and development programs, competitiveand technological advances and other factors. In any event, we will require substantial funds to conduct development activitiesand pre-clinical and clinical trials, apply for regulatory approvals and commercialize products, if any, that are developed.30We do not have any commitments or arrangements to obtain anyadditional financing and there is no assurance that required financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.Even if we spend substantial amounts on research and development, our potential products may not be developed successfully. If our product candidates on which we have expended significantamounts for research and development are not commercialized, we will not earn a return on our research and development expenditures,which may harm our business. Risks relating to our Intellectual Property and RegulatoryApproval Protecting our proprietary rights is difficult and costly.If we fail to adequately protect or enforce our proprietary rights, we could lose potential revenue from licensing and royalties. Our potential revenue and success depends in large part on ourability to obtain, maintain and enforce our patents. Our ability to commercialize any product successfully will largely dependon our ability to obtain and maintain patents of sufficient scope to prevent third parties from developing similar or competitiveproducts. In the absence of patent protection, competitors may impact ourbusiness by developing and marketing substantially equivalent products and technology. Patent disputes are frequent and can preclude the commercializationof products. We have in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be, involved in material patent litigation, such asthe matters discussed under “Part I - Item 3. Legal Proceedings” in this report. Patent protection litigation is time-consumingand we have incurred and anticipate continuing to incur significant legal costs. In addition, an adverse decision could force usto either obtain third-party licenses at a material cost or cease using the technology or product in dispute. We have filed applications for United States and foreign patentscovering certain aspects of our technology, but there is no assurance that pending patents will issue or as to the degree of protectionwhich any issued patent might afford. Lawsuits, including patent infringements, in the biotechnologyindustry are not uncommon. If we become involved in any significant litigation, we would suffer as a result of the diversion ofour management’s attention, the expense of litigation and any judgments against us. In addition to intellectual property litigation for infringement,other substantial, complex or extended litigation could result in large expenditures by us and distraction of our management. Patentlitigation is time-consuming and costly in its own right and could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties. In addition,an adverse decision could force us to either obtain third-party licenses at a material cost or cease using the technology or productin dispute. In addition, lawsuits by employees, stockholders, collaborators or distributors could be very costly and substantiallydisrupt our business. Disputes from time to time with companies or individuals are not uncommon in the biotechnology industry,and we cannot assure you that we will always be able to resolve them out of court. We also utilize certain unpatented proprietary technology andno assurance can be given that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary technology, that suchproprietary technology will not be disclosed or that we can meaningfully protect our rights to such proprietary technology. We may incur impairment charges on our goodwill and intangibleswhich would reduce our earnings. We are subject to Statement of Financial Accounting StandardsASC 350, “Intangibles, Goodwill and Other (“ASC 350”) which requires that goodwill and other intangible assetsthat have an indefinite life be tested at least annually for impairment. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite livesmust also be tested for impairment between the annual tests if a triggering event occurs that would likely reduce the fair valueof the asset below its carrying amount. As of July 31, 2013 and 2012, goodwill represented approximately13% and 11%, respectively, of our total assets. During the fiscal 2012 fourth quarter we recorded impairments on our indefinite-lived intangiblesof $5.7 million and our goodwill of $18.8 million. The aggregate non-cash charge of $24.5 million did not impact the Company’sconsolidated cash flows, liquidity and capital resources (See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). If we determinethat there has been impairment, our financial results for the relevant period would be reduced by the amount of the impairment,net of tax effects, if any. After May 1, 2012, the Company had no intangible assets with indefinite lives.31We may be unable to obtain or maintain regulatory approvalsfor our products, which could reduce our revenue or prevent us from earning a return on our research and development expenditures. Our research, preclinical development, clinical trials, productmanufacturing and marketing are subject to regulation by the FDA and similar health authorities in foreign countries. FDA approvalis required for our products, as well as the manufacturing processes and facilities, if any, used to produce our products thatmay be sold in the United States. The process of obtaining approvals from the FDA is costly, time consuming and often subject tounanticipated delays. Even if regulatory approval is granted, such approval may include significant limitations on indicated usesfor which any products could be marketed. Further, even if such regulatory approvals are obtained, a marketed product and its manufacturerare subject to continued review, and later discovery of previously unknown problems may result in restrictions on such productor manufacturer, including withdrawal of the product from the market. New government regulations in the United States or foreign countriesalso may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our products under development. Further, because genetherapy is a relatively new technology and has not been extensively tested in humans, the regulatory requirements governing genetherapy products are uncertain and may be subject to substantial further review by various regulatory authorities in the UnitedStates and abroad. This uncertainty may result in extensive delays in initiating clinical trials and in the regulatory approvalprocess. Our failure to obtain regulatory approval of their proposed products, processes or facilities could have a material adverseeffect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The proposed products under development may also be subjectto certain other federal, state and local government regulations, including, but not limited to, the Federal Food, Drug and CosmeticAct, the Environmental Protection Act, and Occupational Safety and Health Act, and state, local and foreign counterparts to certainof such acts. We cannot be sure that we can obtain necessary regulatory approvalson a timely basis, if at all, for any of the products we are developing or manufacturing or that we can maintain necessary regulatoryapprovals for our existing products, and all of the following could have a material adverse effect on our business: •significant delays in obtaining or failing to obtain required approvals;  •loss of, or changes to, previously obtained approvals;  •failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements and;  •changes to manufacturing processes, manufacturing process standards or Good Manufacturing Practices following approval or changing interpretations of these factors. Adverse perception and increased regulatory scrutiny of genemedicine and genetic research might limit our ability to conduct our business. Ethical, social and legal concerns about gene medicine, genetictesting and genetic research could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting the technologies we or our collaboratorsmay use. Recently, gene medicine studies have come under increasing scrutiny, which has delayed ongoing and could delay futureclinical trials and regulatory approvals. Federal and state agencies, congressional committees and foreign governments have expressedinterest in further regulating biotechnology. More restrictive regulations or claims that our products are unsafe or pose a hazardcould prevent us from commercializing any products.32Risks relating to our Clinical Labs services segment Our clinical laboratory business is subject to extensive governmentregulation and our loss of any required certifications or licenses could require us to cease operating this part of our business,which would reduce our revenue and injure our reputation. The clinical laboratory industry is subject to significant governmentalregulation at the Federal, state and local levels. Under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act of 1967 and the Clinical LaboratoryImprovement Amendments of 1988 (collectively, as amended, “CLIA”) virtually all clinical laboratories, including ours,must be certified by the Federal government. Many clinical laboratories also must meet other governmental standards, undergo proficiencytesting and are subject to inspection. Certifications or licenses are also required by various state and local laws. The failureof our clinical laboratory to obtain or maintain such certifications or licenses under these laws could interrupt our ability tooperate our clinical laboratory business and injure our reputation. Reimbursements from third-party payers, upon which our clinicallaboratory business is dependent, are subject to inconsistent rates and coverage and legislative reform that are beyond our control.This inconsistency and any reform that decreases coverage and rates could reduce our earnings and harm our business. Our clinical laboratory business is primarily dependent uponreimbursement from third-party payers, such as Medicare (which principally serves patients 65 and older) and commercial insurers.We are subject to variances in reimbursement rates among different third-party payers, as well as constant renegotiation of thosereimbursement rates. We also are subject to audit by Medicare and the commercial insurers, which can result in the return of paymentsmade to us under these programs. These variances in reimbursement rates and audit results could reduce our margins and thus ourearnings. The health care industry continues to undergo significant changeas third-party payers’ increase their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of health care services. In aneffort to address the problem of increasing health care costs, legislation has been proposed or enacted at both the Federal andstate levels to regulate health care delivery in general and clinical laboratories in particular. Some of the proposals includemanaged competition, global budgeting and price controls. Changes that decrease reimbursement rates or coverage, or increase administrativeburdens on billing third-party payers could reduce our revenues and increase our expenses. U.S. healthcare reform legislation may result in significantchange and our business could be adversely impacted if we fail to adapt. Government oversight of and attention to the healthcare industryin the United States is significant and increasing. In March 2010, U.S. federal legislation was enacted to reform healthcare. Theannual updates for clinical laboratory services through 2015, which are based on the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers(CPI-U), are reduced by a multi-factor productivity adjustment and then by 1.75 percentage points. Based on these calculations,the Medicare Fee Schedule was reduced in calendar year 2011 by 1.75% and increased in calendar year 2012 by .65% and a decreaseof 2.95% in calendar year 2013 Future reductions/increases may occur depending on percentage changes in the CPI-U. In 2013, 2012and 2011, approximately 22%, 21% and 22% of our Clinical Lab’s segment revenues were reimbursed by Medicare under the clinicallaboratory fee schedule. The legislation imposes an excise tax on the seller for the sale of certain medical devices in the UnitedStates, including those purchased and used by laboratories, beginning in 2013. The legislation establishes the Independent PaymentAdvisory Board, which will be responsible, beginning in 2014, annually to submit proposals aimed at reducing Medicare cost growthwhile preserving quality. These proposals automatically will be implemented unless Congress enacts alternative proposals that achievethe same savings targets.33Further, the legislation calls for a Center for Medicare andMedicaid Innovation that will examine alternative payment methodologies and conduct demonstration programs. The legislation providesfor extensive health insurance reforms, including the elimination of pre-existing condition exclusions and other limitations oncoverage, fixed percentages on medical loss ratios, expansion in Medicaid and other programs, employer mandates, individual mandates,creation of state and regional health insurance exchanges, and tax subsidies for individuals to help cover the cost of individualinsurance coverage. The legislation also permits the establishment of accountable care organizations, a new healthcare deliverymodel. While the ultimate impact of the legislation on the healthcare industry is unknown, it is likely to be extensive and mayresult in significant change. Our failure to adapt to these changes could have a material adverse effect on our business. Changes in provider mix, including continued growth in capitatedmanaged-cost health care and changes in certain third party provider agreements could have a material adverse impact on the Company’snet revenues and profitability. Certain third party provider companies have adopted nationaland regional programs which include multiple managed-care reimbursement models. If the Company is unable to participate in theseprograms or if the Company would lose a material contract, it could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s net revenuesand profitability. The number of individuals covered under managed care contractsor other similar arrangements has grown over the past several years and may continue to grow in the future. In addition, Medicareand other government healthcare programs may continue to shift to managed care. Entities providing managed care coverage have reducedpayments for medical services, including clinical laboratory services, in numerous ways such as entering into arrangements underwhich payments to a service provider are capitated, limiting testing to specified procedures, denying payment for services performedwithout prior authorization and refusing to increase fees for specified services. These trends reduce our revenues and limit ourability to pass cost increases to our customers. Also, if these or other managed care organizations do not select us as a participatingprovider, we may lose some or all of that business, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition andresults of operations. Because of competitive pressures, impacts of the economy onpatient traffic at our customers and the complexity and expense of the billing process in our clinical laboratory business, wemust obtain new customers while maintaining existing customers to grow our business. Intense competition in the clinical laboratory business, increasingadministrative burdens upon the reimbursement process, reduced patient traffic, and reduced coverage and payments by insurers makeit necessary for us to increase our volume of laboratory services. To do so, we must obtain new customers while retaining existingcustomers. Our failure to attract new customers or the loss of existingcustomers or a reduction in business from those customers could significantly reduce our revenues and impede our ability to grow. Compliance with Medicare administrative policies, includingthose pertaining to certain automated blood chemistry profiles, may reduce the reimbursements we receive. Containment of health care costs, including reimbursement forclinical laboratory services, has been a focus of ongoing governmental activity. Clinical laboratories must bill Medicare directlyfor the services provided to Medicare beneficiaries and may only collect the amounts permitted under this fee schedule. Reimbursementto clinical laboratories under the Medicare Fee Schedule has been steadily declining since its inception. Because a significantportion of our costs is fixed, these Medicare reimbursement reductions and changes have a direct adverse effect on our net earningsand cash flows.34Regulations requiring the use of “standard transactions”for healthcare services may negatively impact our profitability and cash flows. The administrative simplification provisions of the Health InsurancePortability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its implementing regulations, or HIPAA, were designed to improve the efficiencyand effectiveness of the healthcare system by facilitating the electronic exchange of information in certain financial and administrativetransactions while protecting the privacy and security of the information exchanged. The administrative simplification provisionsaddress standards for electronic transactions, security regulations and privacy regulations. The HIPAA transaction standards are complex, and subject to differencesin interpretation by payers. For instance, some payers may interpret the standards to require us to provide certain types of information,including demographic information not usually provided to us by physicians. While most of our transactions are submitted and/orreceived in ANSI standard format, inconsistent application of transaction standards by some remaining payers or our inability toobtain certain billing information not usually provided to us by physicians could increase our costs and the complexity of billing.In addition, new requirements for additional standard transactions, such as claims attachments, could prove technically difficult,time-consuming or expensive to implement. We are working closely with our payers to establish acceptable protocols for claims submissionsand with our industry trade association and an industry coalition to present issues and problems as they arise to the appropriateregulators and standards setting organizations. Compliance with the HIPAA security regulations and privacyregulations may increase our costs. The HIPAA privacy and security regulations establish comprehensivefederal standards with respect to the uses and disclosures of protected health information by health plans, healthcare providersand healthcare clearinghouses (collectively referred to as “Covered Entities”). The HIPAA privacy and security regulationswere recently amended by the Health Information Technology Act and its implementing regulations, or HITECH, to, among other things,expand the obligations of HIPAA to business associates (i.e., individuals or entities who perform services, other than treatment,on behalf of Covered Entities and receive protected health information in order to perform such services). The regulations establisha complex regulatory framework on a variety of subjects, including:  §the circumstances under which uses and disclosures of protected health information are permitted or required without a specific authorization by the patient, including but not limited to treatment purposes, activities to obtain payments for our services, and our healthcare operations activities;    §a patient’s rights to access, amend and receive an accounting of certain disclosures of protected health information;    §requirements to notify individuals if there is a breach of their protected health information;    §the requirements for business associates and the terms of business associate agreements;    §the content of notices of privacy practices for protected health information and;    §administrative, technical and physical safeguards required of entities that use or receive protected health information. We have implemented practices to meet the requirements of theHIPAA privacy and security regulations, and update these practices to comply with HITECH. HIPAA establishes a “floor”and do not supersede state laws that are more stringent. Therefore, we are required to comply with both federal privacy and securityregulations and varying state privacy laws. In addition, for healthcare data transfers from other countries relating to citizensof those countries, we must comply with the laws of those other countries. The federal privacy regulations restrict our abilityto use or disclose patient-identifiable laboratory data, without patient authorization, for purposes other than payment, treatment,healthcare operations and certain other specified disclosures such as public health and governmental oversight of the health careindustry. The privacy and security regulations provide for significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosureof protected health information, including potential civil and criminal fines and penalties. Although the HIPAA statute and regulationsdo not expressly provide for a private right of damages, we also could incur damages under state laws to private parties for thewrongful use or disclosure of confidential health information or other private personal information. Compliance with all of the HIPAA and HITECH regulations, includingstandard transactions, requires ongoing resources from all healthcare organizations, not just clinical laboratories. While we believeour total costs to comply with HIPAA will not be material to our operations or cash flows, new standard transactions and additionalcustomer requirements resulting from different interpretations of the current regulations could impose additional costs on us.35FDA regulation of laboratory-developed tests, analyte specificreagents, or genetic testing could lead to increased costs and delays in introducing new genetic tests. The FDA has regulatory responsibility over instruments, testkits, reagents and other devices used to perform diagnostic testing by clinical laboratories. In the past, the FDA has claimedregulatory authority over laboratory-developed tests, but has exercised enforcement discretion in not regulating tests performedby high complexity CLIA-certified laboratories. In December 2000, the HHS Secretary’s Advisory Committee on Genetic Testingrecommended that the FDA be the lead federal agency to regulate genetic testing. In late 2002, a new HHS Secretary’s AdvisoryCommittee on Genetics, Health and Society, or SACGHS, was appointed to replace the prior Advisory Committee. Ultimately, SACGHSdecided that it would continue to monitor the progress of the federal agencies in the oversight of genetic technologies, but itdid not believe that further action was warranted. In the meantime, the FDA is considering revising its regulations on analytespecific reagents, which are used in laboratory-developed tests, including laboratory-developed genetic testing. FDA interest inor actual regulation of laboratory-developed tests or increased regulation of the various medical devices used in laboratory-developedtesting could lead to periodic inquiry letters from the FDA and increased costs and delays in introducing new tests, includinggenetic tests. In the past, the clinical laboratory industry has received negativepublicity. This publicity has led to increased legislation, regulation, and review of industry practices. These factors may adverselyaffect our ability to market our services, require us to change our services and increase the regulatory burdens under which weoperate, further increasing the costs of doing business and adversely affecting our operating results. If we experience a significantdisruption in our information technology systems, including our website, or if we fail to implement new systems and software successfully,our business could be adversely affected. Other risks relating to our business If we fail to maintain or monitor our information systemsour businesses could be adversely affected. We depend on information systems throughout our Company to controlour Life Science manufacturing, inventory, distribution and website and the Clinical Lab processes for: processing orders, managinginventory, processing shipments to and collecting cash from our customers, responding to customer inquiries, contributing to ouroverall internal control processes, maintaining records of our property, plant and equipment, and recording and paying amountsdue vendors and other creditors. If we were to experience a prolonged disruption in our information systems that involve interactionswith customers and suppliers, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and/or increased costs, which could adverselyaffect our business. If we fail to attract and retain key personnel, includingour senior management, our business could be adversely affected. Most of our products and services are highly technical in nature.In general, only highly qualified and trained scientists and technician personnel have the necessary skills to develop proprietarytechnological products and market our products, support our research and development programs and provide our Clinical Lab services. In addition, some of our manufacturing, quality control, safetyand compliance, information technology and e-commerce related positions are highly technical as well. Further, our sales personnelhighly trained and are important to retaining and growing our businesses. Our success depends in large part upon our ability toidentify, hire, retain and motivate highly skilled professionals.36We face intense competition for these professionals from ourcompetitors, customers, marketing partners and other companies throughout the industries in which we compete. Since our inceptionwe have successfully recruited and hired qualified key employees. Any failure on our part to hire, train, and retain a sufficientnumber of qualified professionals would seriously damage our business. We depend heavily on the services of our senior management. Webelieve that our future success depends on the continued services of such management. Our business may be harmed by the loss ofa significant number of our senior management in a short period of time. The insurance we purchase to cover our potential businessrisk may be inadequate. Although we believe that our present insurance coverage is sufficientto cover our current estimated exposures, we cannot assure that we will not incur liabilities in excess of our policy limits. Inaddition, although we believe that will be able to continue to obtain adequate coverage, we cannot assure that we will be ableto do so at acceptable costs. Risks relating to our international operations Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may adverselyaffect our business. Since we operate as a multinational corporation that sells andsources products in many different countries, changes in exchange rates could in the future, adversely affect our cash flows andresults of operations. Furthermore, reported sales and purchases made in non-U.S. currenciesby our international businesses, when translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes, fluctuate due to exchangerate movement. Due to the number of currencies involved, the variability of currency exposures and the potential volatility ofcurrency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on future sales and operating results. We are subject to economic, political and other risks associatedwith our significant international business, which could adversely affect our financial results. We operate internationally primarily through wholly-owned subsidiarieslocated in North America and Europe. Revenues outside the United States were approximately 14% of total revenues in fiscal 2013.Our sales and earnings could be adversely affected by a variety of factors resulting from our international operations, including •future fluctuations in exchange rates;  •complex regulatory requirements and changes in those requirements;  •trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;  •multiple jurisdictions and differing tax laws, as well as changes in those laws;  •restrictions on our ability to repatriate investments and earnings from foreign operations;  •changes in the political or economic conditions in a country or region, particularly in developing or emerging markets;  •changes in shipping costs; and  •difficulties in collecting on accounts receivable. If any of these risks materialize, we could face substantialincreases in costs, the reduction of profit and the inability to do business.37Risks Relating to our Common Stock Our stock price has been volatile, which could result in substantiallosses for investors. Our common stock is quoted on the New York Stock Exchange, andthere has been historical volatility in the market price of our common stock. The trading price of our common stock has been, andis likely to continue to be, subject to significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors, including: •fluctuations in our quarterly operating and earnings per share results;  •the gain or loss of significant contracts;  •the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets;  •loss of key personnel;  •announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors;  •delays in the development and introduction of new products;  •legislative or regulatory changes;  •general trends in the industries we operate;  •recommendations and/or changes in estimates by equity and market research analysts;  •biological or medical discoveries;  •disputes and/or developments concerning intellectual property, including patents and litigation matters;  •public concern as to the safety of new technologies;  •sales of common stock of existing holders;  •securities class action or other litigation;  •developments in our relationships with current or future customers and suppliers and;  •general economic conditions, both in the United States and worldwide. In addition, the stock market in general has experienced extremeprice and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of our common stock, as well as the stock of many companies inour industries. Often, price fluctuations are unrelated to operating performance of the specific companies whose stock is affected. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market priceof a company’s stock, securities class action litigation has occurred against the issuing company. If we were subject tothis type of litigation in the future, we could incur substantial costs and a diversion of our management’s attention andresources, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings. Any adverse determination in this typeof litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities.38Because we do not intend to pay cash dividends on our commonstock, an investor in our common stock will benefit only if it appreciates in value. We currently intend to retain our retained earnings and futureearnings, if any, to finance the expansion of our business and do not expect to pay any cash dividends on our common stock in theforeseeable future. As a result, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon any future appreciation.There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which investors purchased theirshares. It may be difficult for a third party to acquire us, whichcould inhibit stockholders from realizing a premium on their stock price. We are subject to the New York anti-takeover laws regulatingcorporate takeovers. These anti-takeover laws prohibit certain business combinations between a New York corporation and any “interestedshareholder” (generally, the beneficial owner of 20% or more of the corporation’s voting shares) for five years followingthe time that the shareholder became an interested shareholder, unless the corporation’s board of directors approved thetransaction prior to the interested shareholder becoming interested. Our certificate of incorporation, as amended, and by-laws containprovisions that could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us that stockholders may considerfavorable or beneficial. These provisions could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to electdirectors and take other corporate actions. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to payin the future for shares of our common stock. These provisions include: •a staggered board of directors, so that it would take three successive annual meetings to replace all directors; and  •advance notice requirements for the submission by stockholders of nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting. Future sales of shares of our common stock or the issuanceof securities senior to our common stock could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our ability to raisefunds in new equity offerings. We are not restricted from issuing additional common stock, preferredstock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock. Future sales of a substantial number of our shares of commonstock or equity-related securities in the public market or privately, or the perception that such sales could occur, could adverselyaffect prevailing trading prices of our common stock, and could impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings ofequity or equity-related securities. No prediction can be made as to the effect, if any, that future sales of shares of commonstock or the availability of shares of common stock for future sale will have on the trading price of our common stock. Risk relating to our debt Our use of leverage may expose us to substantial risks, includinginterest rate risk. As of July 31, 2013, we had $3.3 million in borrowings underour Revolving Loan and Security Agreement (“credit agreement”). In addition, we may incur additional indebtedness inthe future. Accordingly, we are exposed to the typical risks associated with the use of leverage. Increased leverage makes it moredifficult for us to withstand adverse economic conditions or business plan variances, to take advantage of new business opportunities,or to make necessary capital expenditures. The existing credit agreement contains restrictive covenant restrictions that limitour ability to conduct our business, including restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness. Our ability to maintainour compliance with these covenants is dependent on our financial performance, which is influenced by a number of factors. Violationof any of these covenants would result in an event of default under the credit agreement. Upon the occurrence of an event of defaultthat is not cured or waived, the lender would have the ability to accelerate the repayment of all amounts then outstanding underthe credit agreement. In the event of a default, and during the continuance of an event of default under the credit agreement,we would no longer have the right to borrow additional funds under the credit agreement. Under these circumstances, we may notbe able to pay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it on terms that are acceptable to us or at all. Our credit agreement requires the payment of interest based on3 month LIBOR plus a fixed rate. Fluctuations in this variable interest rate could negatively impact our financial results.39"

0,ENZ,ENZO BIOCHEM INC,2008-10-14,"RiskFactors          Risksrelating to our Company and our industries          Wehave experienced significant losses in our last two fiscal years and quarter toquarter. If such losses continue, the value of your investment could declinesignificantly.           We incurreda net loss of $10.7 million and $13.3 million for the fiscal years ended July31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. If our revenues do not increase, or if ouroperating expenses exceed expectations or cannot be reduced, we will continueto suffer substantial losses which could have an adverse effect on our businessand adversely affect your investment in our Company.           Ouroperating results may vary from period to period.           Ouroperating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from yearto year, depending on a variety of factors including:     competitive conditions, including changes in third-party reimbursements,     exchange rate fluctuations,     changes in tax laws, the results of tax audits or the measurement of tax uncertainties,     the timing of our research and development, sales and marketing expenses,     the introduction of new products by us or our competitors,     the success of identifying, acquiring and integrating businesses that complement our product offering, add new technology or add presence in a market, 24    customer demand for our products due to changes in purchasing requirements and research needs, and     general worldwide economic conditions affecting funding of research.           Consequently,results for any interim period may not necessarily be indicative of results insubsequent periods.           Ourfuture success will depend in part upon our ability to enhance existingproducts and to develop and introduce new products.           The marketfor our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolvingindustry standards and new product introductions, which may make our existingproducts obsolete. Our future success will depend in part upon our ability toenhance existing products and to develop and introduce new products.           Thedevelopment of new or enhanced products is a complex and uncertain processrequiring the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends as wellas precise technological execution. In addition, the successful development ofnew products will depend on the development of new technologies. We will berequired to undertake time-consuming and costly development activities and toseek regulatory approval for these new products. We may experience difficultiesthat could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction andmarketing of these new products. Regulatory clearance or approval of any newproducts may not be granted by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities on atimely basis, or at all, and the new products may not be successfullycommercialized.           We maybe unable to identify, acquire and integrate acquisition targets.          In the pasttwo fiscal years we have made significant acquisitions. Our strategy envisionsthat a part our future growth will come from acquiring and integrating similaroperations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitableacquisition candidates and, once identified, to negotiate successfully theiracquisition at a price or on terms and conditions favorable to us, or tointegrate the operations of such acquired businesses with the existing operations.In addition, we compete for acquisition candidates with other entities, some ofwhich have greater financial resources than ours. Our failure to implementsuccessfully its acquisition strategy would limit our potential growth.           Ourinability to carry out certain of our marketing and sales plans may make itdifficult for us to grow or maintain our business.           The LifeSciences segment continues to implement an aggressive marketing programdesigned to more directly service its end users, while simultaneouslypositioning us for product line expansion. We will continue to expand the reachof companies by our direct field sales force, continued attendance at topindustry trade meetings, and publications in leading scientific journals, aswell as the on-going enhancement of our interactive web sites. In addition toour direct sales, we operate worldwide through wholly-owned subsidiaries (inUSA, Switzerland, Germany, and UK) and a network of third-party distributors inmost other significant markets. If we are unable to successfully implementthese programs, we may be unable to grow and our business could suffer.           Weface intense competition, which could cause us to decrease the prices for ourproducts or services or render our products uneconomical or obsolete, any ofwhich could reduce our revenues and limit our growth.           Ourcompetitors in the biotechnology industry in the United States and abroad arenumerous and include major pharmaceutical, energy, food and chemical companies,as well as specialized genetic engineering firms. Many of our large competitorshave substantially greater resources than us and have the capability ofdeveloping products which compete directly with our products. Many of thesecompanies are performing research in the same areas as we are. The markets forour products are also subject to competitive risks because markets are highlyprice competitive. Our competitors have competed in the past by lowering priceson certain products. The clinical laboratory business is highly fragmented andintensely competitive, and we compete with numerous national and localcompanies. Some of these entities are larger than we are and have greaterresources than we do. We compete primarily on the basis of the quality of ourtesting, reporting and information services, our reputation in the medicalcommunity, the pricing of our services and our ability to employ qualifiedlaboratory personnel.           Thesecompetitive conditions could, among other things:     Require us to reduce our prices to retain market share;     Require us to increase our marketing efforts which could reduce our profit margins;     Increase our cost of labor to attract qualified personnel; 25    Render our biotechnology products uneconomical or obsolete; or     Reduce our revenue.           Wedepend on distributors and contract manufacturers and suppliers for materialsthat could impair our ability to manufacture or distribute our products.           Outside distributors,suppliers and contract manufacturers provide key finished goods, components andraw materials used in the sale and manufacture of our products. Our LifeSciences segment distributes product for over 40 unrelated third partymanufacturers. To the extent we are unable to maintain or replace a distributorin a reasonable time period, or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all,our operations could be disrupted. Although we believe that alternative sourcesfor components and raw materials are available, any supply interruption in alimited or sole source component or raw material would harm our ability tomanufacture our products until a new source of supply is identified andqualified. In addition, an uncorrected defect or suppliers variation in acomponent or raw material, either unknown to us or incompatible with ourmanufacturing process, could harm our ability to manufacture products. We mightnot be able to find a sufficient alternative supplier in a reasonable timeperiod, or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we fail to obtain asupplier for the components of our products, our operations could be disrupted.          Weuse hazardous materials in our business. Any claims relating to improperhandling, storage or disposal of these materials could be costly andtime-consuming.           Ourmanufacturing, clinical laboratory and research and development processesinvolve the storage, use and disposal of hazardous substances, includinghazardous chemicals, biological hazardous materials and radioactive compounds.We are subject to federal, state and local regulations governing the use,manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of materials and waste products.Although we believe that our safety and environmental management practices andprocedures for handling and disposing of these hazardous materials are inaccordance with good industry practice and comply with applicable laws,permits, licenses and regulations, the risk of accidental environmental orhuman contamination or injury from the release or exposure of hazardousmaterials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of an accident, wecould be held liable for any damages that result, including environmentalclean-up or decontamination costs, and any such liability could exceed thelimits of, or fall outside the coverage of, our insurance.           We may notbe able to maintain insurance on acceptable terms, or at all. We could berequired to incur significant costs to comply with current or futureenvironmental and public and workplace safety and health laws and regulations.           We are required to expend significantresources forresearch and development for our products in development and these products maynot be developed successfully. Failure to successfully develop these productsmay prevent us from earning a return on our research and developmentexpenditures.           Theproducts we are developing are at various stages of development and clinicalevaluations and may require further technical development and investment todetermine whether commercial application is practicable. There can be noassurance that our efforts will result in products with valuable commercialapplications. Our cash requirements may vary materially from current estimatesbecause of results of our research and development programs, competitive andtechnological advances and other factors. In any event, we will requiresubstantial funds to conduct development activities and pre-clinical andclinical trials, apply for regulatory approvals and commercialize products, ifany, that are developed. We do not have any commitments or arrangements toobtain any additional financing and there is no assurance that requiredfinancing will be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. Even if wespend substantial amounts on research and development, our potential productsmay not be developed successfully. If our product candidates on which we haveexpended significant amounts for research and development are notcommercialized, we will not earn a return on our research and developmentexpenditures, which may harm our business.           Risksrelating to our Intellectual Property and Regulatory Approval          Protectingour proprietary rights is difficult and costly. If we fail to adequatelyprotect or enforce our proprietary rights, we could lose potential revenue fromlicensing and royalties.           Ourpotential revenue and success depends in large part on our ability to obtain,maintain and enforce our patents. Our ability to commercialize any productsuccessfully will largely depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patentsof sufficient scope to prevent third parties from developing similar orcompetitive products. In the absence of patent protection, competitors may impactour business by developing and marketing substantially equivalent products andtechnology. 26          Patentdisputes are frequent and can preclude the commercialization of products. Wehave in the past been, are currently, and may in the future be, involved inmaterial patent litigation, such as the matters discussed under Part I - Item3. Legal Proceedings in this report. Patent protection litigation istime-consuming and we have incurred significant legal costs. In addition, anadverse decision could force us to either obtain third-party licenses at amaterial cost or cease using the technology or product in dispute.           We havefiled applications for United States and foreign patents covering certainaspects of our technology, but there is no assurance that pending patents willissue or as to the degree of protection which any issued patent might afford.           Lawsuits,including patent infringements, in the biotechnology industry are not uncommon.If we become involved in any significant litigation, we would suffer as aresult of the diversion of our managements attention, the expense oflitigation and any judgments against us.           In additionto intellectual property litigation for infringement, other substantial,complex or extended litigation could result in large expenditures by us anddistraction of our management. Patent litigation is time-consuming and costlyin its own right and could subject us to significant liabilities to thirdparties. In addition, an adverse decision could force us to either obtainthird-party licenses at a material cost or cease using the technology orproduct in dispute. In addition, lawsuits by employees, stockholders,collaborators or distributors could be very costly and substantially disrupt ourbusiness. Disputes from time to time with companies or individuals are notuncommon in the biotechnology industry, and we cannot assure you that we willalways be able to resolve them out of court.           We alsoutilize certain unpatented proprietary technology.           Wemay incur impairment charges on our goodwill and other intangible assets withindefinite lives that would reduce our earnings.          We aresubject to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill andOther Intangible Assets, (SFAS 142) which requires that goodwill and otherintangible assets that have an indefinite life be tested at least annually forimpairment. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives mustalso be tested for impairment between the annual tests if a triggering eventoccurs that would likely reduce the fair value of the asset below its carryingamount. As of July 31, 2008, goodwill and other intangible assets withindefinite lives represented approximately 25% of our total assets. If wedetermine that there has been impairment, our financial results for therelevant period would be reduced by the amount of the impairment, net of taxeffects, if any.           Wemay be unable to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals for our products,which could reduce our revenue or prevent us from earning a return on ourresearch and development expenditures.           Ourresearch, preclinical development, clinical trials, product manufacturing andmarketing are subject to regulation by the FDA and similar health authoritiesin foreign countries. FDA approval is required for our products, as well as themanufacturing processes and facilities, if any, used to produce our productsthat may be sold in the United States. The process of obtaining approvals fromthe FDA is costly, time consuming and often subject to unanticipated delays.Even if regulatory approval is granted, such approval may include significantlimitations on indicated uses for which any products could be marketed. Further,even if such regulatory approvals are obtained, a marketed product and itsmanufacturer are subject to continued review, and later discovery of previouslyunknown problems may result in restrictions on such product or manufacturer,including withdrawal of the product from the market.           Newgovernment regulations in the United States or foreign countries also may beestablished that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our productsunder development. Further, because gene therapy is a relatively new technologyand has not been extensively tested in humans, the regulatory requirementsgoverning gene therapy products are uncertain and may be subject to substantialfurther review by various regulatory authorities in the United States and abroad.This uncertainty may result in extensive delays in initiating clinical trialsand in the regulatory approval process. Our failure to obtain regulatoryapproval of their proposed products, processes or facilities could have amaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results ofoperations. The proposed products under development may also be subject tocertain other federal, state and local government regulations, including, butnot limited to, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, the EnvironmentalProtection Act, and Occupational Safety and Health Act, and state, local andforeign counterparts to certain of such acts.           We cannotbe sure that we can obtain necessary regulatory approvals on a timely basis, ifat all, for any of the products we are developing or manufacturing or that wecan maintain necessary regulatory approvals for our existing products, and allof the following could have a material adverse effect on our business: 27    Significant delays in obtaining or failing to obtain required approvals;     Loss of, or changes to, previously obtained approvals;     Failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements; and     Changes to manufacturing processes, manufacturing process standards or Good Manufacturing Practices following approval or changing interpretations of these factors.           Adverseperception and increased regulatory scrutiny of gene medicine and geneticresearch might limit our ability to conduct our business.           Ethical,social and legal concerns about gene medicine, genetic testing and geneticresearch could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting thetechnologies we or our collaborators may use. Recently, gene medicine studieshave come under increasing scrutiny, which has delayed ongoing and could delayfuture clinical trials and regulatory approvals. Federal and state agencies,congressional committees and foreign governments have expressed interest infurther regulating biotechnology. More restrictive regulations or claims thatour products are unsafe or pose a hazard could prevent us from commercializingany products.           Risksrelating to our Clinical Labs services segment          Ourclinical laboratory business is subject to extensive government regulation andour loss of any required certifications or licenses could require us to ceaseoperating this part of our business, which would reduce our revenue and injureour reputation.           The clinicallaboratory industry issubject to significant governmental regulation at the Federal, state and locallevels. Under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act of 1967 and the ClinicalLaboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (collectively, as amended, CLIA)virtually all clinical laboratories, including ours, must be certified by theFederal government. Many clinical laboratories also must meet governmentalstandards, undergo proficiency testing and are subject to inspection.Certifications or licenses are also required by various state and local laws.The failure of our clinical laboratory to obtain or maintain suchcertifications or licenses under these laws could interrupt our ability tooperate our clinical laboratory business and injure our reputation.           Reimbursementsfrom third-party payers, upon which our clinical laboratory business isdependent, are subject to inconsistent rates and coverage and legislativereform that are beyond our control. This inconsistency and any reform thatdecreases coverage and rates could reduce our earnings and harm our business.           Ourclinical laboratory business is primarily dependent upon reimbursement fromthird-party payers, such as Medicare (which principally serves patients 65 andolder) and insurers. We are subject to variances in reimbursement rates amongdifferent third-party payers, as well as constant renegotiation ofreimbursement rates. We also are subject to audit by Medicare which can resultin the return of payments made to us under these programs. These variances inreimbursement rates and audit results could reduce our margins and thus ourearnings.           The healthcare industry continues to undergo significant change as third-party payersincrease their efforts to control the cost, utilization and delivery of healthcare services. In an effort to address the problem of increasing health carecosts, legislation has been proposed or enacted at both the Federal and statelevels to regulate health care delivery in general and clinical laboratories inparticular. Some of the proposals include managed competition, global budgetingand price controls. Changes that decrease reimbursement rates or coverage, orincrease administrative burdens on billing third-party payers could reduce ourrevenues and increase our expenses.           Changesin provider mix, including a continued growth in capitated managed-cost healthcare and changes in certain third party provider agreements could have amaterial adverse impact on the Companys net revenues and profitability.           Certain third partyprovidercompanies have adopted national and regional programs which include multiplemanaged-care reimbursement models. If the Company is unable to participate inthese programs or if the Company would lose a material contract, it could havea material adverse impact on the Companys net revenues and profitability. 28          The numberof individuals covered under managed care contracts or other similararrangements has grown over the past several years and may continue to grow inthe future. In addition, Medicare and other government healthcare programs maycontinue to shift to managed care. Entities providing managed care coveragehave reduced payments for medical services, including clinical laboratory services,in numerous ways such as entering into arrangements under which payments to aservice provider are capitated, limiting testing to specified procedures,denying payment for services performed without prior authorization and refusingto increase fees for specified services. These trends reduce our revenues andlimit our ability to pass cost increases to our customers. Also, if these orother managed care organizations do not select us as a participating provider,we may lose some or all of that business, which could have an adverse effect onour business, financial condition and results of operations.           Because of competitive pressures and thecomplexityand expense of the billing process in our clinical laboratory business, we mustobtain new customers while maintaining existing customers to grow our business.          Intensecompetition in the clinical laboratory business, increasing administrativeburdens upon the reimbursement process and reduced coverage and payments byinsurers make it necessary for us to increase our volume of laboratoryservices. To do so, we must obtain new customers while retaining existingcustomers. Our failure to attract new customers or the loss of existingcustomers or a reduction in business from those customers could significantlyreduce our revenues and impede our ability to grow.           Compliancewith Medicare administrative policies, including those pertaining to certainautomated blood chemistry profiles, may reduce the reimbursements we receive.           Containmentof health care costs, including reimbursement for clinical laboratory services,has been a focus of ongoing governmental activity. Clinical laboratories mustbill Medicare directly for the services provided to Medicare beneficiaries andmay only collect the amounts permitted under this fee schedule. Reimbursementto clinical laboratories under the Medicare Fee Schedule has been steadilydeclining since its inception. Furthermore, Medicare has mandated use of thePhysicians Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, for coding of laboratoryservices which has altered the way we bill these programs for some of ourservices, thereby reducing the reimbursement that we receive.           In March1996, HCFA (now, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services or CMS)implemented changes in the policies used to administer Medicare payments toclinical laboratories for the most frequently performed automated bloodchemistry profiles. Among other things, the changes established a consistentstandard nationwide for the content of the automated chemistry profiles.Another change requires laboratories performing certain automated bloodchemistry profiles to obtain and provide documentation of the medical necessityof tests included in the profiles for each Medicare beneficiary. Reimbursementshave been reduced as a result of this change. Because a significant portion ofour costs is fixed, these Medicare reimbursement reductions and changes have adirect adverse effect on our net earnings and cash flows.           Regulationsrequiring the use of standard transactions for healthcare services issuedunder the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, orHIPAA, may negatively impact our profitability and cash flows.          Pursuant tothe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, theSecretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has issuedfinal regulations designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of thehealthcare system by facilitating the electronic exchange of information incertain financial and administrative transactions while protecting the privacyand security of the information exchanged. Three principal regulations havebeen issued in final form: standards for electronic transactions, securityregulations and privacy regulations.           The HIPAAtransaction standards are complex, and subject to differences in interpretationby payers. For instance, some payers may interpret the standards to require usto provide certain types of information, including demographic information notusually provided to us by physicians. While most of our transactions aresubmitted and / or received in ANSI standard format, inconsistent applicationof transaction standards by some remaining payers or our inability to obtaincertain billing information not usually provided to us by physicians couldincrease our costs and the complexity of billing. In addition, new requirementsfor additional standard transactions, such as claims attachments, could provetechnically difficult, time-consuming or expensive to implement. We are workingclosely with our payers to establish acceptable protocols for claimssubmissions and with our industry trade association and an industry coalitionto present issues and problems as they arise to the appropriate regulators andstandards setting organizations. 29          Compliancewith the HIPAA security regulations and privacy regulations may increase ourcosts.           The HIPAAprivacy and security regulations, which became fully effective in April 2003and April 2005, respectively, establish comprehensive federal standards withrespect to the uses and disclosures of protected health information by healthplans, healthcare providers and healthcare clearinghouses, in addition tosetting standards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability ofprotected health information. The regulations establish a complex regulatoryframework on a variety of subjects, including:     the circumstances under which uses and disclosures of protected health information are permitted or required without a specific authorization by the patient, including but not limited to treatment purposes, activities to obtain payments for our services, and our healthcare operations activities;     a patients rights to access, amend and receive an accounting of certain disclosures of protected health information;     the content of notices of privacy practices for protected health information; and     administrative, technical and physical safeguards required of entities that use or receive protected health information.           We haveimplemented practices to meet the requirements of the HIPAA privacy andsecurity regulations, as required by law. The privacy regulations establish afloor and do not supersede state laws that are more stringent. Therefore, weare required to comply with both federal privacy regulations and varying stateprivacy laws. In addition, for healthcare data transfers from other countriesrelating to citizens of those countries, we must comply with the laws of thoseother countries. The federal privacy regulations restrict our ability to use ordisclose patient-identifiable laboratory data, without patient authorization,for purposes other than payment, treatment or healthcare operations (as definedby HIPAA), except for disclosures for various public policy purposes and otherpermitted purposes outlined in the privacy regulations. The privacy andsecurity regulations provide for significant fines and other penalties forwrongful use or disclosure of protected health information, including potentialcivil and criminal fines and penalties. Although the HIPAA statute andregulations do not expressly provide for a private right of damages, we alsocould incur damages under state laws to private parties for the wrongful use ordisclosure of confidential health information or other private personalinformation.           Compliancewith all of the HIPAA regulations, including new standard transactions,requires ongoing resources from all healthcare organizations, not just clinicallaboratories. While we believe our total costs to comply with HIPAA will not bematerial to our operations or cash flows, new standard transactions and additionalcustomer requirements resulting from different interpretations of the currentregulations could impose additional costs on us.           FDAregulation of laboratory-developed tests, analyte specific reagents, or genetictesting could lead to increased costs and delays in introducing new genetictests.           The FDA hasregulatory responsibility over instruments, test kits, reagents and otherdevices used to perform diagnostic testing by clinical laboratories. In thepast, the FDA has claimed regulatory authority over laboratory-developed tests,but has exercised enforcement discretion in not regulating tests performed byhigh complexity CLIA-certified laboratories. In December 2000, the HHSSecretarys Advisory Committee on Genetic Testing recommended that the FDA bethe lead federal agency to regulate genetic testing. In late 2002, a new HHSSecretarys Advisory Committee on Genetics, Health and Society, or SACGHS, wasappointed to replace the prior Advisory Committee. Ultimately, SACGHS decided thatit would continue to monitor the progress of the federal agencies in theoversight of genetic technologies, but it did not believe that further actionwas warranted. In the meantime, the FDA is considering revising its regulationson analyte specific reagents, which are used in laboratory-developed tests,including laboratory-developed genetic testing. FDA interest in or actualregulation of laboratory-developed tests or increased regulation of the variousmedical devices used in laboratory-developed testing could lead to periodicinquiry letters from the FDA and increased costs and delays in introducing newtests, including genetic tests.           In thepast, the clinical laboratory industry has received negative publicity. Thispublicity has led to increased legislation, regulation, and review of industrypractices. These factors may adversely affect our ability to market ourservices, require us to change our services and increase the regulatory burdensunder which we operate, further increasing the costs of doing business andadversely affecting our operating results. If we experience a significantdisruption in our information technology systems, including our website, or ifwe fail to implement new systems and software successfully, our business couldbe adversely affected. 30          We dependon information systems throughout our Company to control our Life Sciencemanufacturing, distribution and website and the Clinical Lab processes for:processing orders, managing inventory, processing shipments to and collectingcash from our customers, responding to customer inquiries, contributing to ouroverall internal control processes, maintaining records of our property, plantand equipment, and recording and pay amounts due vendors and other creditors.If we were to experience a prolonged disruption in our information systems thatinvolve interactions with customers and suppliers, it could result in the lossof sales and customers and/or increased costs, which could adversely affect ourbusiness.           Ifwe fail to attract and retain key personnel, including our senior management,our business could be adversely affected.           Most of our productsand servicesare highly technical in nature. In general, only highly qualified and trainedscientists and technician personnel have the necessary skills to developproprietary technological products and market our products, support ourresearch and development programs and provide our Clinical Lab services. Inaddition, some of our manufacturing, quality control, safety and compliance,information technology and e-commerce related positions are highly technical aswell. Further, our sales personnel highly trained and are important toretaining and growing our businesses. Our success depends in large part uponour ability to identify, hire, retain and motivate highly skilledprofessionals.           We faceintense competition for these professionals from our competitors, customers,marketing partners and other companies throughout the industries in which wecompete. Since our inception an insignificant number of key employees have leftus. Any failure on our part to hire, train, and retain a sufficient number ofqualified professionals would seriously damage our business.           We dependheavily on the services of our senior management. We believe that our futuresuccess depends on the continued services of such management. Our business maybe harmed by the loss of a significant number of our senior management in ashort period of time.           Theinsurance we purchase to cover our potential business risk may be inadequate.           Although webelieve that our present insurance coverage is sufficient to cover our currentestimated exposures, we cannot assure that we will not incur liabilities in excessof our policy limits. In addition, although we believe that will be able tocontinue to obtain adequate coverage, we cannot assure that we will be able todo so at acceptable costs.           Risksrelating to our international operations          Foreigncurrency exchange rate fluctuations may adversely affect our business.           Since weoperate as a multinational corporation that sells and sources products in manydifferent countries, changes in exchange rates could in the future, adverselyaffect our cash flows and results of operations. Furthermore, reported salesand purchases made in non-U.S. currencies by our international businesses, whentranslated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes, fluctuate due toexchange rate movement. Due to the number of currencies involved, thevariability of currency exposures and the potential volatility of currencyexchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations onfuture sales and operating results.           Weare subject to economic, political and other risks associated with oursignificant international business, which could adversely affect our financialresults.          We    operate internationally primarily through wholly-owned subsidiaries located    in North America and Europe. Revenues outside the United States were approximately    25% of total revenues in fiscal 2008. We expect that sales from internationaloperations will continue to represent a growing portion of our sales as aresult of the May 2008 acquisition of Biomol. Our sales and earnings could beadversely affected by a variety of factors resulting from our internationaloperations, including:     future fluctuations in exchange rates,     complex regulatory requirements and changes in those requirements,     trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements,     multiple jurisdictions and differing tax laws, as well as changes in those laws,     restrictions on our ability to repatriate investments and earnings from foreign operations, 31    changes in the political or economic conditions in a country or region, particularly in developing or emerging markets,     changes in shipping costs, and     difficulties in collecting on accounts receivable.           If any ofthese risks materialize, we could face substantial increases in costs, thereduction of profit and the inability to do business.           RisksRelating to our Common Stock          Ourstock price has been volatile, which could result in substantial losses forinvestors.           Our commonstock is quoted on the New York Stock Exchange, and there has been historicalvolatility in the market price of our common stock. The trading price of ourcommon stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, subject to significantfluctuations due to a variety of factors, including:     fluctuations in our quarterly operating and earnings per share results;     the gain or loss of significant contracts;     loss of key personnel;     announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors;     delays in the development and introduction of new products;     legislative or regulatory changes;     general trends in the industries we operate;     recommendations and/or changes in estimates by equity and market research analysts;     biological or medical discoveries;     disputes and/or developments concerning intellectual property, including patents and litigation matters;     public concern as to the safety of new technologies;     sales of common stock of existing holders;     securities class action or other litigation;     developments in our relationships with current or future customers and suppliers; and     general economic conditions, both in the United States and worldwide.           Inaddition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volumefluctuations that have affected the market price of our common stock, as wellas the stock of many companies in our industries. Often, price fluctuations areunrelated to operating performance of the specific companies whose stock isaffected.           In thepast, following periods of volatility in the market price of a companys stock,securities class action litigation has occurred against the issuing company. Ifwe were subject to this type of litigation in the future, we could incursubstantial costs and a diversion of our managements attention and resources,each of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings.Any adverse determination in this type of litigation could also subject us tosignificant liabilities.           Becausewe do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock, an investor in ourcommon stock will benefit only if it appreciates in value.           Wecurrently intend to retain our retained earnings and future earnings, if any,to finance the expansion of our business and do not expect to pay any cashdividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. As a result, thesuccess of an investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon anyfuture appreciation. There is no guarantee that our common stock willappreciate in value or even maintain the price at which investors purchasedtheir shares. 32          Itmay be difficult for a third party to acquire us, which could inhibitstockholders from realizing a premium on their stock price.           We aresubject to the New York anti-takeover laws regulating corporate takeovers.These anti-takeover laws prohibit certain business combinations between a NewYork corporation and any interested shareholder (generally, the beneficialowner of 20% or more of the corporations voting shares) for five yearsfollowing the time that the shareholder became an interested shareholder,unless the corporations board of directors approved the transaction prior tothe interested shareholder becoming interested.           Ourcertificate of incorporation, as amended, and by-laws contain provisions thatcould have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in controlof us that stockholders may consider favorable or beneficial. These provisionscould discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders toelect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions could alsolimit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for sharesof our common stock. These provisions include:     a staggered board of directors, so that it would take three successive annual meetings to replace all directors; and     advance notice requirements for the submission by stockholders of nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting.           Futuresales of shares of our common stock or the issuance of securities senior to ourcommon stock could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock andour ability to raise funds in new equity offerings.           We are notrestricted from issuing additional common stock, preferred stock or securitiesconvertible into or exchangeable for common stock. Future sales of asubstantial number of our shares of common stock or equity-related securitiesin the public market or privately, or the perception that such sales couldoccur, could adversely affect prevailing trading prices of our common stock,and could impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings ofequity or equity-related securities. No prediction can be made as to the effect,if any, that future sales of shares of common stock or the availability ofshares of common stock for future sale will have on the trading price of ourcommon stock.           "
