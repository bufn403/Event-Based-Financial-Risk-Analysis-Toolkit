5,CHE,CHEMED CORP,2024-02-29,"Risk Factors
 You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in evaluating us and our Capital Stock.  They are not the only ones facing the Company.  Other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. ROTO-ROOTER We face intense competition from numerous, fragmented competitors.  If we do not compete effectively, our business may suffer. We face intense competition from numerous competitors.  The sewer, drain and pipe cleaning, excavation, plumbing repair and water restoration businesses are highly fragmented, with the bulk of the competitors consisting of local and regional entities.  We compete primarily on the basis of advertising, range of services provided, name recognition, availability of emergency service, speed and quality of customer service, service guarantees and pricing.  Our competitors may succeed in developing new or enhanced products and services more successful than ours and in marketing and selling existing and new products and services better than we do.  In addition, new competitors may emerge.  We cannot make any assurances that we will continue to be able to compete successfully with any of these companies.   Our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations, exposing us to potential claims and compliance costs that could adversely affect our business. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to franchising, insurance and other aspects of our business.  These are discussed in greater detail under “Government Regulations” in the Description of Business section hereof.  If we fail to comply with existing or future laws and regulations, we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines and sanctions.  Our franchising activities are subject to various federal and state franchising laws and regulations, including the rules and regulations of the FTC regarding the offering or sale of franchises.  These rules and regulations require us to provide all of our prospective franchisees with specific information regarding us and our franchise program in the form of a detailed franchise offering circular.  In addition, a number of states require us to register our franchise offering prior to offering or selling franchises in such states.  Various state laws also provide for certain rights in favor of franchisees, including (i) limitations on the franchisor’s ability to terminate a franchise except for good cause, (ii) restrictions on the franchisor’s ability to deny renewal of a franchise, (iii) circumstances under which the franchisor may be required to purchase certain inventory of franchisees when a franchise is terminated or not renewed in violation of such laws and (iv) provisions relating to arbitration.  The ability to engage in the plumbing repair business is also subject to certain limitations and restrictions imposed by the state and local licensing laws and regulations.   We cannot predict what legislation or regulations affecting our business will be enacted in the future, how existing or future laws or regulations will be enforced, administered and interpreted, or the amount of future expenditures that may be required to comply with these laws or regulations.  Compliance costs associated with governmental regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Roto-Rooter’s loss of key management personnel or its inability to hire and retain skilled employees could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. Roto-Rooter’s future success significantly depends upon the continued service of its senior management personnel.  The loss of one or more of Roto-Rooter’s key senior management personnel or its inability to hire and retain new skilled employees could negatively impact its ability to maintain or increase customer calls and jobs, a key aspect of its growth strategy, and could adversely affect its future operating results.  13 Competition for skilled employees, particularly licensed plumbers, is intense, and the process of locating and recruiting skilled employees with the combination of qualifications and attributes required to adequately perform plumbing duties can be difficult and lengthy.  We cannot assure you that Roto-Rooter will be successful in attracting, retaining or training highly skilled personnel.  Roto-Rooter’s business could be disrupted and its growth and profitability negatively impacted if it is unable to attract and retain skilled employees.  Cybersecurity Our information technology systems hold sensitive customer information in the ordinary course of business, including names, addresses, and partial credit card information. We utilize those same systems to perform our day-to-day activities, such as receiving customer calls, dispatching technicians to jobs, and maintaining an accurate record of all transactions.  We have not experienced any known modern system/data breaches on our information technology systems that compromised customer data or the company’s proprietary data.  We maintain our information technology systems with safeguard protection against cyber-attacks, including intrusion detection and protection services, firewalls, and virus detection software. Every month, we test our information technology systems using cyber-scanning software and other methods to learn how a successful system/data breach may occur. If a deficiency is detected, our IT staff will log and remediate the deficiency prescribed by the vendor or manufacturer.  Roto-Rooter has developed and tested a response plan in the event of a successful system/data breach and maintains commercial insurance related to cyber-security. We obtain internal control reports from key vendors that maintain company data or process company transactions on a yearly basis.  We review these reports to detect any potential cybersecurity issues. However, these safeguards do not ensure that a significant system/data breach may occur.  Due to the pandemic, certain roles have been conducted remotely, increasing the role and importance of our information technology and security systems.  A successful attack on our information technology systems could significantly affect the business, including liability for compromised customer information and business interruption. Roto-Rooter’s success is highly dependent on its brand reputation Roto-Rooter’s national reputation and brand image for performing necessary, high quality services in a timely manner is critical to Roto-Rooter’s continued success.  Adverse publicity, litigation or on-line negative reviews focused on the Roto-Rooter brand could negatively impact Roto-Rooter’s national reputation resulting in decreased future demand for Roto-Rooter branded services.  Roto-Rooter maintains a reputation management risk program, however, a loss of brand reputation at Roto-Rooter could adversely affect consumer willingness to use our service and thus, adversely affect our future operating performance. VITAS  VITAS is highly dependent on payments from Medicare and Medicaid.  If there are changes in the rate or methods governing these payments, VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profits could be materially affected. In excess of 95% of VITAS’ net patient service revenue consists of payments from the Medicare and Medicaid programs.  Such payments are made primarily on a “per diem” basis, subject to annual reimbursement caps.  Because VITAS receives a per diem fee to provide eligible services to all patients, VITAS’ profitability is largely dependent upon its ability to manage the costs of providing hospice services to patients.  Increases in operating costs, such as labor and supply costs that are subject to inflation, without a compensating increase in Medicare and Medicaid rates, could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business in the future.  Additionally, regulators are increasing scrutiny of claims, including through the new TPE program, which may require additional resources to respond to audits, and which may cause additional delays or denials in receiving payments.  Medicare and Medicaid currently adjust the various hospice payment rates annually based primarily on the increase or decrease of the hospital wage index basket, regionally adjusted.  However, the increases may be less than actual inflation.  VITAS’ profitability could be negatively impacted if this adjustment were eliminated or reduced, or if VITAS’ costs of providing hospice services increased more than the annual adjustment.  In addition, cost pressures resulting from shorter patient lengths of stay and the use of more expensive forms of palliative care, including drugs and drug delivery systems, could negatively impact VITAS’ profitability.  Many payors are increasing pressure to control health care costs.  The U.S. federal budget remains in flux, which could, among other things, cut Medicare payments to providers.  The Medicare program is frequently mentioned as a target for spending cuts and within the Medicare program the hospice benefit is often specifically targeted for cuts and a lowering of the Medicare Caps.  The full impact on our business of any future cuts in Medicare (including lowering of the Medicare Caps) or other programs is uncertain.  In addition, both public and private payors are increasing pressure to decrease, or limit increases in, reimbursement rates for health care services.  VITAS’ levels of revenue and profitability will be subject to the effect of possible reductions in coverage or payment rates by third-party payors, including payment rates from Medicare and Medicaid. Each state that maintains a Medicaid program has the option to provide reimbursement for hospice services at reimbursement rates generally required to be at least as much as Medicare rates.  All states in which VITAS operates cover Medicaid hospice services; however, we cannot assure you that the states in which VITAS is presently operating or states into which VITAS could expand operations will continue to cover Medicaid hospice services.  In addition, the Medicare and Medicaid programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive and prospective rate and payment adjustments, administrative rulings, freezes and funding reductions,  14all of which may adversely affect the level of program payments and could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business.  We cannot assure that Medicare and/or Medicaid payments to hospices will not decrease.  Reductions in amounts paid by government programs for services or changes in methods or regulations governing payments could cause VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profits to materially decline. 15% to 20% of VITAS’ days of care are provided to patients who reside in nursing homes. Changes in the laws and regulations regarding payments for hospice services and “room and board” provided to VITAS’ hospice patients residing in nursing homes could reduce its net patient service revenue and profitability. For VITAS’ hospice patients receiving nursing home care under certain state Medicaid programs who elect hospice care under Medicare and Medicaid, the state generally must pay VITAS, in addition to the applicable Medicare or Medicaid hospice per diem rate, an amount equal to at least 95% of the Medicaid per diem nursing home rate for “room and board” furnished to the patient by the nursing home.  VITAS contracts with various nursing homes for the nursing homes’ provision of certain “room and board” services that the nursing homes would otherwise provide Medicaid nursing home patients.  VITAS bills and collects from the applicable state Medicaid program an amount equal to approximately 95% of the amount that would otherwise have been paid directly to the nursing home under the state’s Medicaid plan.  Under VITAS’ standard nursing home contracts, it pays the nursing home for these “room and board” services at approximately 100% of the Medicaid per diem nursing home rate. The reduction or elimination of Medicare and Medicaid payments for hospice patients residing in nursing homes would reduce VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profitability.  In addition, changes in the way nursing homes are reimbursed for “room and board” services provided to hospice patients residing in nursing homes could affect VITAS’ ability to serve patients in nursing homes.  If VITAS is unable to maintain relationships with existing patient referral sources or to establish new referral sources, VITAS’ growth and profitability could be adversely affected.  VITAS’ success is heavily dependent on referrals from physicians, long-term care facilities, hospitals and other institutional health care providers, managed care companies, insurance companies and other patient referral sources in the communities that its hospice locations serve, as well as on its ability to maintain good relations with these referral sources.  VITAS’ referral sources may refer their patients to other hospice care providers or not to a hospice provider at all.  Additionally, during the pandemic, VITAS  experienced significant changes in referral patterns and sources.  VITAS’ growth and profitability depend significantly on its ability to establish and maintain close working relationships with these patient referral sources and to increase awareness and acceptance of hospice care by its referral sources and their patients.  We cannot assure that VITAS will be able to maintain its existing relationships or that it will be able to develop and maintain new relationships in existing or new markets.  Moreover, if pandemic-related or other shifts to referrals continue, it could materially adversely affect the business.  VITAS’ loss of existing relationships or its failure to develop new relationships could adversely affect its ability to expand or maintain its operations and operate profitably.  Moreover, we cannot assure you that awareness or acceptance of hospice care will increase or remain at current levels.  VITAS operates in an industry that is subject to extensive government regulation and claims reviews, and changes in law and regulatory interpretations could reduce its net patient service revenue and profitability and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. The healthcare industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations relating to, among others: Payment for services; Conduct of operations, including quality assurance, fraud and abuse, anti-kickback prohibitions, self-referral prohibitions and false claims; Privacy and security of medical records; Employment practices; and Various state approval requirements, such as facility and professional licensure, certificate of need, compliance surveys and other certification or recertification requirements.  Changes in these laws, rules and regulations or their interpretations or methods of enforcement, including the elimination of any certificate of need laws or other license restrictions, could reduce VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profitability, or increase VITAS’ liabilities, cost of compliance, or legal and other costs in defending any claims.  VITAS’ ability to comply with such regulations is a key factor in determining the success of its business.  See the “Government Regulations” section of this 10-K for a greater description of these matters.  15  VITAS maintains an internal regulatory compliance review program and from time to time retains regulatory counsel for guidance on compliance matters.  We cannot assure you, however, that VITAS’ practices, if reviewed, would be found to be in compliance with applicable health regulatory laws, as such laws ultimately may be interpreted, or that any non-compliance with such laws would not have a material adverse effect on VITAS. Federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives could require VITAS to expend substantial sums on acquiring, implementing and supporting new information systems, which could negatively impact its profitability and cash flows. There are currently numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives at both the state and federal levels that address patient privacy concerns.  We cannot predict the total financial or other impact of the regulations on VITAS’ operations.  In addition, although VITAS’ management believes it is in compliance with the requirement of patient privacy regulations, we cannot assure you that VITAS will not be found to have violated state and federal laws, rules or guidelines surrounding patient privacy.  Compliance with current and future HIPAA and HITECH requirements or any other federal or state privacy initiatives could require VITAS to make substantial investments, which could negatively impact its profitability and cash flows. VITAS’ growth strategies may not be successful, which could adversely affect its business. A significant element of VITAS’ growth strategy is expected to include expansion of its business in new and existing markets.  This aspect of VITAS’ growth strategy may not be successful, which could adversely impact its growth and profitability.  We cannot assure you that VITAS will be able to: Identify markets that meet its selection criteria for new hospice locations; Hire and retain qualified management teams to operate each of its new hospice locations; Manage a large and geographically diverse group of hospice locations; Become Medicare and Medicaid certified in new markets; Generate sufficient hospice admissions to operate profitably in these new markets; Compete effectively with existing hospices in new markets; or Obtain state licensure and/or a certificate of need from appropriate state agencies in new markets. VITAS’ loss of key management personnel or its inability to hire and retain skilled employees could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. VITAS’ future success significantly depends upon the continued service of its senior management personnel.  The loss of one or more of VITAS’ key senior management personnel or its inability to hire and retain new skilled employees could negatively impact VITAS’ ability to maintain or increase patient referrals, a key aspect of its growth strategy, and could adversely affect its future operating results.  Competition for skilled employees is intense, and the process of locating and recruiting skilled employees with the combination of qualifications and attributes required to care effectively for terminally ill patients and their families can be difficult and lengthy.  We cannot assure you that VITAS will be successful in attracting, retaining or training highly skilled nursing, management, community education, operations, admissions and other personnel.  VITAS’ business could be disrupted and its growth and profitability negatively impacted if it is unable to attract and retain skilled employees. A nationwide shortage of qualified nurses and aides could adversely affect VITAS’ profitability, growth and ability to continue to provide quality, responsive hospice services to its patients as nursing and health aides’ wages and benefits increase.  A significant portion of VITAS’ workforce is licensed nurses.  VITAS depends on qualified nurses to provide quality, responsive hospice services to its patients.  The current nationwide shortage of qualified nurses impacts some of the markets in which VITAS provides hospice services.  In response to this shortage, VITAS has adjusted its wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and to engage contract nurses.  Similarly, there recently has been a shortage of home health aides, who provide many of the hospice services provided by VITAS.  VITAS has also adjusted its wages and benefits to recruit and retain home health and other aides.  VITAS’ inability to attract and retain qualified nurses and aides as well as other healthcare workers, could adversely affect its ability to provide quality, responsive hospice services to its patients and its ability to increase or maintain patient census in those markets.  Increases in  16the wages and benefits required to attract and retain qualified nurses or an increase in reliance on contract nurses could negatively impact profitability. VITAS may not be able to compete successfully against other hospice providers, and competitive pressures may limit its ability to maintain or increase its market position, which could adversely affect its profitability, financial condition and cash flows. Hospice care in the United States is highly competitive.  In many areas in which VITAS’ hospices are located, they compete with a large number of organizations, including: Community-based hospice providers; National and regional companies; Hospital-based hospice and palliative care programs; Physician groups; Nursing homes; Home health agencies; Infusion therapy companies; and Nursing agencies. Various health care companies have diversified into the hospice industry and there is an increasing consolidation across hospice industry.  Other companies, including hospitals and health care organizations that are not currently providing hospice care, may enter the markets VITAS serves and expand the variety of services offered to include hospice care. Additionally, jurisdictions where VITAS operates where competition is limited by Certificates of Need, may remove or lessen these restrictions, which could increase competition.  We cannot assure you that VITAS will not encounter increased competition in the future that could limit its ability to maintain or increase its market position, including competition from parties in a position to impact referrals to VITAS.  Such increased competition could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business, financial condition and results of operations. Changes in rates or methods of payment for VITAS’ services could adversely affect its revenues and profits.  Managed care organizations have grown substantially in terms of the percentage of the population they cover and their control over an increasing portion of the health care economy.  Managed care organizations have continued to consolidate to enhance their ability to influence the delivery of health care services and to exert pressure to control health care costs.  VITAS has a number of contractual arrangements with managed care organizations and other similar parties. VITAS provides hospice care to many Medicare beneficiaries who have elected Medicare managed care.  Under such contracts between HMOs and the federal Department of Health and Human Services, the Medicare payments for hospice services are excluded from the per-member, per-month payment from Medicare to HMOs and instead are paid directly by Medicare to the hospices.  As a result, VITAS’ payments for Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare risk HMOs are processed in the same way with the same rates as other Medicare beneficiaries.  We cannot assure, however, that payment for hospice services will continue to be excluded from HMO payment under Medicare risk contracts and similar Medicare managed care plans or that if not excluded, managed care organizations or other large third-party payors would not use their power to influence and exert pressure on health care providers to reduce costs in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business, financial condition and results of operations.  Liability claims may have an adverse effect on VITAS, and its insurance coverage may be inadequate. Participants in the hospice industry are subject to lawsuits alleging negligence, professional liability, wage and hour or other similar legal theories, many of which involve large claims and significant defense costs.  Additionally, the pandemic may lead to different claims or a higher volume of claims than we typically face.  We are also subject to the risk of lawsuits under the False Claims Act and comparable state laws for allegedly submitting fraudulent bills for services to the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other federal and state healthcare programs.  These lawsuits, which may be initiated by “whistleblowers”, subpoenas or Civil Investigative Demands can involve significant monetary damages, fines, attorneys’ fees and the award of bounties to private qui tam plaintiffs. From time to time, VITAS is subject to such claims and other types of lawsuits.  See the description below under Legal Proceedings in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  The ultimate liability for claims, if any, could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or operating results.  Although VITAS currently maintains liability insurance intended to cover certain claims, we cannot  17assure you that the coverage limits of such insurance policies will be adequate or that all such claims will be covered by the insurance.  In addition, VITAS’ insurance policies must be renewed annually and may be subject to cancellation during the policy period.  While VITAS has been able to obtain liability insurance in the past, such insurance varies in cost, and may not be available in the future on terms acceptable to VITAS, if at all.A successful claim in excess of the insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on VITAS.  Claims, regardless of their merit or eventual outcome, also may have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business and reputation due to the costs of litigation, diversion of management’s time and related publicity. VITAS procures professional liability coverage on a claims-made basis.  The insurance contracts specify that coverage is available only during the term of each insurance contract.  VITAS’ management intends to renew or replace the existing claims-made policy annually but such coverage is difficult to obtain, may be subject to cancellation and may be written by carriers that are unable, or unwilling to pay claims. Additionally, some risks and liabilities, including claims for punitive damages, are not covered by insurance.  Cybersecurity  In the normal course of business, our information technology systems hold sensitive patient information including patient demographic data, eligibility for various medical plans including Medicare and Medicaid and protected health information.  We utilize those same systems to perform our day-to-day activities, such as receiving referrals, assigning medical teams to patients, documenting medical information and maintaining an accurate record of all transactions.  Recently healthcare organizations have been the focus of increased cybersecurity attacks.  We have not experienced any known attacks on our information technology systems that have compromised patient data or the Company’s proprietary data.  We maintain our information technology systems with safeguard protection against cyber-attacks including active intrusion protection, firewalls and virus detection software.  As discussed previously, we are subject to and comply with HIPAA and HITECH regulations.  We have developed and tested a response plan in the event of a successful attack and we maintain commercial insurance related to a cyber-attack. We obtain internal control reports from key vendors that maintain company data or process company transactions on a yearly basis.  We review these reports to detect any potential cybersecurity issues.  However, these safeguards do not ensure that a significant cyber-attack could not occur.  Increases in working from home and the provision of telehealth services due to the pandemic have significantly increased our usage of information technology systems and heightened the need for security of those systems.  A successful attack on our information technology systems could have significant consequences to the business including liability for compromised patient information and business interruption. We are regularly the target of attempted cyber and other security threats and must continuously monitor and develop our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent, detect, address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact.  Insider or employee cyber and security threats are increasingly a concern for all large companies, including ours. VITAS’ success is highly dependent on its brand reputation VITAS’ reputation for performing quality routine and high acuity patient hospice care within the regulations mandated by Medicare, Medicaid and commercial payors is critical to our success.  Failure to provide quality patient care within the regulations mandated by our third-party payors, or the perception of inappropriate care resulting in adverse publicity, litigation or a campaign of negative on-line reviews are some of the factors that could negatively impact VITAS’ national reputation.  VITAS maintains a reputation management risk program however, a loss of brand reputation at VITAS could adversely affect referral sources’ willingness to refer our service and thus, adversely affect our future operating performance. It is unclear what affects that CMS’ new Special Focus Program (“SFP”) may have on VITAS’ brand reputation.  In the event that CMS selects hospices for the SFP program utilizing the current algorithm, it is possible that certain VITAS hospice locations are included in the hospices that the algorithm identifies within the bottom 10% or even bottom 1% of hospices.  Although CMS has stated that providers will not be able to replicate the results of the algorithm because not all information utilized by CMS has been made public, given what is known, large providers appear to be significantly more likely to be identified as poor performers because the formula does not account for size of program when analyzing the number of substantiated complaints.  Additionally, providers who submit Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (“CAHPS”) scores (as VITAS does) appear to be more likely to be identified as poor performers. In the event that one or more VITAS programs is identified in the bottom 10% of hospices, it could negatively affect VITAS’ brand reputation in a material adverse manner.  Additionally, if any VITAS program is identified in the bottom 1% of hospices and placed in the SFP, it will have additional governmental oversight and intervention that could materially adversely affect the operations and profitability of such program.  VITAS’ headquarters and a significant portion of its operations are in south Florida The occurrence of a natural disaster in any region that VITAS has significant operations could have a negative impact on the business.  VITAS’ headquarters are located in south Florida.  In addition, two of our largest programs and an office complex are in south  18Florida.  The location of our headquarters and these large programs increases our exposure to hurricanes.  A major hurricane in south Florida could impede our ability to bill for our services, operate our businesses and serve our patients in the affected area.  VITAS maintains a disaster recovery program to mitigate this risk; however, natural disasters could have an adverse effect on our future operating performance. GENERAL The agreements and instruments governing borrowing capacity contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business and adversely affect the price of our Capital Stock. The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our instruments of indebtedness restrict our ability to incur additional debt; issue and sell capital stock of subsidiaries; sell assets; engage in transactions with affiliates; restrict distributions from subsidiaries; incur liens; engage in business other than permitted businesses; engage in sale/leaseback transactions; engage in mergers or consolidations; make capital expenditures; make guarantees; make investments and acquisitions; enter into operating leases; hedge interest rates; and prepay other debt. Moreover, if we are unable to meet the terms of the financial covenants or if we breach any of these covenants, a default could result under one or more of these agreements.  A default, if not waived by our lenders, could accelerate repayment of our outstanding indebtedness.  If acceleration occurs, we may not be able to repay our debt and it is unlikely that we would be able to borrow sufficient additional funds to refinance such debt on acceptable terms.  In the event of any default under our credit facilities, the lenders thereunder could elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, to be due and payable, and to require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings, any of which would be an event of default. We depend on our management team and the loss of their service could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of our executive management team.  The loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract or retain other skilled personnel in the future.  Environmental and safety compliance costs and liabilities could increase our expenses and adversely affect our financial condition. Our operations are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that prohibit or restrict the discharge of pollutants into the environment and regulate employee exposure to hazardous substance in the workplace.  Failure to comply with these laws could subject us to material costs and liabilities, including civil and criminal fines, costs to cleanup contamination we cause and, in some circumstances, costs to cleanup contamination we discover on our own property but did not cause. Because we use and generate hazardous materials in some of our operations, we are potentially subject to material liabilities relating to the cleanup of contamination and personal injury claims.  In addition, we have retained certain environmental liabilities in connection with the sale of former businesses.  We are currently funding the cleanup of historical contamination at one of our former properties and contributing to the cleanup of third-party sites as a result of our sale of our former subsidiary DuBois Chemicals Inc.  Although we have established a reserve for these liabilities, actual cleanup costs may exceed our current estimates due to factors beyond our control, such as the discovery of additional contamination or the enforcement of more stringent cleanup requirements.  New laws and regulations or their stricter enforcement, the discovery of presently unknown conditions or the receipt of additional claims for indemnification could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities including impairment of our brand that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to certain anti-takeover statutes that might make it more difficult to effect a change in control of the Company. We are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits us from engaging in a “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.  The application of Section 203 could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control that could be advantageous to stockholders. Additionally, the FTC and other antitrust regulators have recently heightened their scrutiny of both horizontal and vertical merges in healthcare which could delay or prevent potential acquisitions, divestitures or a change in control.   19 An adverse ruling against us in certain litigation could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We are involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of our business currently and from time to time.  The damages claimed against us in some of these cases can be substantial.  See the “Legal Proceedings” sections of this 10-K and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of particular matters. We cannot assure you that we will prevail in pending cases.  Regardless of the outcome, such litigation is costly to manage, investigate and defend, and the related defense costs, diversion of management’s time and related publicity may adversely affect the conduct of our business and the results of our operations. We have historically incurred debt to finance the operations of the Company.   The Company has historically had debt service obligations and has the ability through its existing credit facility to incur debt that may restrict our operating flexibility.  We cannot assure you that our cash flow from operations would be sufficient to service our future operating needs, which would require us to borrow additional funds, or restructure or otherwise refinance our debt.  In addition, the Company has the ability to expand its existing debt and borrowing capacity subject to various restrictions and covenants defined by its creditors.  The interest rate the Company pays will fluctuate from time to time based upon a number of factors including current SOFR rates and Company operating performance.  Significant changes in these factors could result in a material change in the Company’s interest expense. Our future ability to repay or to refinance our indebtedness and to pay interest on our indebtedness will depend on our operating performance, which may be affected by factors beyond our control.  These factors could include operating difficulties, increased operating costs, our competitors’ actions and regulatory developments.  Our ability to meet our debt service and other obligations may depend in significant part on the extent to which we successfully implement our business strategy.  We cannot assure you that we will be able to implement our strategy fully or that the anticipated results of our strategy will be realized.  Credit market conditions may make it difficult for us to obtain new financing or refinance our current debt on terms and conditions acceptable to us. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our potential debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional equity capital or restructure our debt.  We cannot assure you that our cash flows and capital resources would be sufficient to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness in the future or that alternative measures would successfully meet our debt service obligations. Issues associated with the actual or perceived effects of another epidemic, pandemic, or similar widespread public health concern, could adversely affect our businesses. Our businesses may be negatively impacted by the fear of exposure to or actual effects of another epidemic, pandemic, or similar widespread public health concern as we experienced with the COVID-19 pandemic.  Negative impacts may include, but not be limited to: restrictions or limitations on our ability to continue operations and service our patients and customers in-person, changes in demand for our services or mix of services demanded, additional costs for personal protection equipment and other items or processes necessitated to maintain the health and safety of our employees, customers and patients, isolated outbreaks of disease that may affect our ability to provide services in certain areas for a period of time, and increasing difficulty in our ability to hire employees to provide in-person services for our patients and customers during the pendency of any public health concern.  Despite our efforts to manage and remedy these impacts, their ultimate impact also depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of any such outbreak as well as third-party actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects"
14,CHE,CHEMED CORP,2023-02-27,"Risk Factors
 You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in evaluating us and our Capital Stock.  They are not the only ones facing the Company.  Other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. We continue to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business and geographies, including how it will impact our customers, team members, suppliers, vendors, business partners and distribution channels.  The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption, which has and will continue to adversely affect our business operations and may materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. For additional information regarding specific risk factors related to COVID-19 pandemic, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation under Part I., Item 2 of this Annual Report on Form-10K.   ROTO-ROOTER We face intense competition from numerous, fragmented competitors.  If we do not compete effectively, our business may suffer. We face intense competition from numerous competitors.  The sewer, drain and pipe cleaning, excavation, plumbing repair and water restoration businesses are highly fragmented, with the bulk of the competitors consisting of local and regional entities.  We compete primarily on the basis of advertising, range of services provided, name recognition, availability of emergency service, speed and quality of customer service, service guarantees and pricing.  Our competitors may succeed in developing new or enhanced products and services more successful than ours and in marketing and selling existing and new products and services better than we do.  In  13addition, new competitors may emerge.  We cannot make any assurances that we will continue to be able to compete successfully with any of these companies.   Our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations, exposing us to potential claims and compliance costs that could adversely affect our business. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to franchising, insurance and other aspects of our business.  These are discussed in greater detail under “Government Regulations” in the Description of Business section hereof.  If we fail to comply with existing or future laws and regulations, we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines and sanctions.  Our franchising activities are subject to various federal and state franchising laws and regulations, including the rules and regulations of the FTC regarding the offering or sale of franchises.  These rules and regulations require us to provide all of our prospective franchisees with specific information regarding us and our franchise program in the form of a detailed franchise offering circular.  In addition, a number of states require us to register our franchise offering prior to offering or selling franchises in such states.  Various state laws also provide for certain rights in favor of franchisees, including (i) limitations on the franchisor’s ability to terminate a franchise except for good cause, (ii) restrictions on the franchisor’s ability to deny renewal of a franchise, (iii) circumstances under which the franchisor may be required to purchase certain inventory of franchisees when a franchise is terminated or not renewed in violation of such laws and (iv) provisions relating to arbitration.  The ability to engage in the plumbing repair business is also subject to certain limitations and restrictions imposed by the state and local licensing laws and regulations.   We cannot predict what legislation or regulations affecting our business will be enacted in the future, how existing or future laws or regulations will be enforced, administered and interpreted, or the amount of future expenditures that may be required to comply with these laws or regulations.  Compliance costs associated with governmental regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Roto-Rooter’s loss of key management personnel or its inability to hire and retain skilled employees could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. Roto-Rooter’s future success significantly depends upon the continued service of its senior management personnel.  The loss of one or more of Roto-Rooter’s key senior management personnel or its inability to hire and retain new skilled employees could negatively impact its ability to maintain or increase customer calls and jobs, a key aspect of its growth strategy, and could adversely affect its future operating results. Competition for skilled employees, particularly licensed plumbers, is intense, and the process of locating and recruiting skilled employees with the combination of qualifications and attributes required to adequately perform plumbing duties can be difficult and lengthy.  We cannot assure you that Roto-Rooter will be successful in attracting, retaining or training highly skilled personnel.  Roto-Rooter’s business could be disrupted and its growth and profitability negatively impacted if it is unable to attract and retain skilled employees.   Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, rules and regulations have been promulgated that could affect the ability for Roto-Rooter to hire new or retain current employees, particularly if those employees have decided not to get vaccinated against COVID-19.  In the event that new rules or regulations are promulgated that regulate the ability of employees to continue to be employed in the event that they are not vaccinated, or be employed only under certain testing or other restrictions, Roto-Rooter could lose a significant percentage of its workforce, particularly in the event that the terms of the rules or regulations would treat Roto-Rooter differently than its competitors.  Such a loss could have a material adverse effect on Roto-Rooter’s ability to service its customers and on its revenues Cybersecurity Our information technology systems hold sensitive customer information in the ordinary course of business, including names, addresses, and partial credit card information. We utilize those same systems to perform our day-to-day activities, such as receiving customer calls, dispatching technicians to jobs, and maintaining an accurate record of all transactions.  We have not experienced any known system/data breaches on our information technology systems that compromised customer data or the company’s proprietary data.  We maintain our information technology systems with safeguard protection against cyber-attacks, including intrusion detection and protection services, firewalls, and virus detection software. Every month, we test our information technology systems using cyber-scanning software and other methods to learn how a successful system/data breach may occur. If a deficiency is detected, our IT staff will log and remediate the deficiency prescribed by the vendor or manufacturer.  Roto-Rooter has developed and tested a response plan in the event of a successful system/data breach and maintains commercial insurance related to cyber-security. We obtain internal control reports from key vendors that maintain company data or process company transactions on a yearly basis.  We review these reports to detect any potential cybersecurity issues. However, these safeguards do not ensure that a significant system/data breach may occur.  Due to the pandemic, certain roles have been conducted remotely, increasing the role and importance of our information technology and security systems.  A successful attack on our information technology systems could significantly affect the business, including liability for compromised customer information and business interruption.  14 Roto-Rooter’s success is highly dependent on its brand reputation Roto-Rooter’s national reputation and brand image for performing necessary, high quality services in a timely manner is critical to Roto-Rooter’s continued success.  Adverse publicity, litigation or on-line negative reviews focused on the Roto-Rooter brand could negatively impact Roto-Rooter’s national reputation resulting in decreased future demand for Roto-Rooter branded services.  Roto-Rooter maintains a reputation management risk program, however, a loss of brand reputation at Roto-Rooter could adversely affect consumer willingness to use our service and thus, adversely affect our future operating performance. VITAS  VITAS is highly dependent on payments from Medicare and Medicaid.  If there are changes in the rate or methods governing these payments, VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profits could be materially affected. In excess of 90% of VITAS’ net patient service revenue consists of payments from the Medicare and Medicaid programs.  Such payments are made primarily on a “per diem” basis, subject to annual reimbursement caps.  Because VITAS receives a per diem fee to provide eligible services to all patients, VITAS’ profitability is largely dependent upon its ability to manage the costs of providing hospice services to patients.  Increases in operating costs, such as labor and supply costs that are subject to inflation, without a compensating increase in Medicare and Medicaid rates, could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business in the future.  Additionally, regulators are increasing scrutiny of claims, including through the new TPE program, which may require additional resources to respond to audits, and which may cause additional delays or denials in receiving payments.  Medicare and Medicaid currently adjust the various hospice payment rates annually based primarily on the increase or decrease of the hospital wage index basket, regionally adjusted.  However, the increases may be less than actual inflation.  VITAS’ profitability could be negatively impacted if this adjustment were eliminated or reduced, or if VITAS’ costs of providing hospice services increased more than the annual adjustment.  In addition, cost pressures resulting from shorter patient lengths of stay and the use of more expensive forms of palliative care, including drugs and drug delivery systems, could negatively impact VITAS’ profitability.  Many payors are increasing pressure to control health care costs.  The U.S. federal budget remains in flux, which could, among other things, cut Medicare payments to providers.  The Medicare program is frequently mentioned as a target for spending cuts and within the Medicare program the hospice benefit is often specifically targeted for cuts and a lowering of the Medicare Caps.  The full impact on our business of any future cuts in Medicare (including lowering of the Medicare Caps) or other programs is uncertain.  In addition, both public and private payors are increasing pressure to decrease, or limit increases in, reimbursement rates for health care services.  VITAS’ levels of revenue and profitability will be subject to the effect of possible reductions in coverage or payment rates by third-party payors, including payment rates from Medicare and Medicaid. Each state that maintains a Medicaid program has the option to provide reimbursement for hospice services at reimbursement rates generally required to be at least as much as Medicare rates.  All states in which VITAS operates cover Medicaid hospice services; however, we cannot assure you that the states in which VITAS is presently operating or states into which VITAS could expand operations will continue to cover Medicaid hospice services.  In addition, the Medicare and Medicaid programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive and prospective rate and payment adjustments, administrative rulings, freezes and funding reductions, all of which may adversely affect the level of program payments and could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business.  We cannot assure that Medicare and/or Medicaid payments to hospices will not decrease.  Reductions in amounts paid by government programs for services or changes in methods or regulations governing payments could cause VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profits to materially decline. 15% to 20% of VITAS’ days of care are provided to patients who reside in nursing homes. Changes in the laws and regulations regarding payments for hospice services and “room and board” provided to VITAS’ hospice patients residing in nursing homes could reduce its net patient service revenue and profitability. For VITAS’ hospice patients receiving nursing home care under certain state Medicaid programs who elect hospice care under Medicare and Medicaid, the state generally must pay VITAS, in addition to the applicable Medicare or Medicaid hospice per diem rate, an amount equal to at least 95% of the Medicaid per diem nursing home rate for “room and board” furnished to the patient by the nursing home.  VITAS contracts with various nursing homes for the nursing homes’ provision of certain “room and board” services that the nursing homes would otherwise provide Medicaid nursing home patients.  VITAS bills and collects from the applicable state Medicaid program an amount equal to approximately 95% of the amount that would otherwise have been paid directly to the nursing home under the state’s Medicaid plan.  Under VITAS’ standard nursing home contracts, it pays the nursing home for these “room and board” services at approximately 100% of the Medicaid per diem nursing home rate. The reduction or elimination of Medicare and Medicaid payments for hospice patients residing in nursing homes would reduce VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profitability.  In addition, changes in the way nursing homes are reimbursed for “room and board” services provided to hospice patients residing in nursing homes could affect VITAS’ ability to serve patients in nursing homes.   15 If VITAS is unable to maintain relationships with existing patient referral sources or to establish new referral sources, VITAS’ growth and profitability could be adversely affected.  VITAS’ success is heavily dependent on referrals from physicians, long-term care facilities, hospitals and other institutional health care providers, managed care companies, insurance companies and other patient referral sources in the communities that its hospice locations serve, as well as on its ability to maintain good relations with these referral sources.  VITAS’ referral sources may refer their patients to other hospice care providers or not to a hospice provider at all.  Additionally, because of the pandemic, VITAS has experienced significant changes in referral patterns and sources.  VITAS’ growth and profitability depend significantly on its ability to establish and maintain close working relationships with these patient referral sources and to increase awareness and acceptance of hospice care by its referral sources and their patients.  We cannot assure that VITAS will be able to maintain its existing relationships or that it will be able to develop and maintain new relationships in existing or new markets.  Moreover, if pandemic-related shifts to referrals continue, it could materially adversely affect the business.  VITAS’ loss of existing relationships or its failure to develop new relationships could adversely affect its ability to expand or maintain its operations and operate profitably.  Moreover, we cannot assure you that awareness or acceptance of hospice care will increase or remain at current levels.  VITAS operates in an industry that is subject to extensive government regulation and claims reviews, and changes in law and regulatory interpretations could reduce its net patient service revenue and profitability and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. The healthcare industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations relating to, among others: Payment for services; Conduct of operations, including fraud and abuse, anti-kickback prohibitions, self-referral prohibitions and false claims; Privacy and security of medical records; Employment practices; and Various state approval requirements, such as facility and professional licensure, certificate of need, compliance surveys and other certification or recertification requirements.  Changes in these laws, rules and regulations or their interpretations or methods of enforcement, including the elimination of any certificate of need laws or other license restrictions, could reduce VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profitability, or increase VITAS’ liabilities, cost of compliance, or legal and other costs in defending any claims.  VITAS’ ability to comply with such regulations is a key factor in determining the success of its business.  See the “Government Regulations” section of this 10-K for a greater description of these matters.  VITAS maintains an internal regulatory compliance review program and from time to time retains regulatory counsel for guidance on compliance matters.  We cannot assure you, however, that VITAS’ practices, if reviewed, would be found to be in compliance with applicable health regulatory laws, as such laws ultimately may be interpreted, or that any non-compliance with such laws would not have a material adverse effect on VITAS. Federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives could require VITAS to expend substantial sums on acquiring, implementing and supporting new information systems, which could negatively impact its profitability and cash flows. There are currently numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives at both the state and federal levels that address patient privacy concerns.  We cannot predict the total financial or other impact of the regulations on VITAS’ operations.  In addition, although VITAS’ management believes it is in compliance with the requirement of patient privacy regulations, we cannot assure you that VITAS will not be found to have violated state and federal laws, rules or guidelines surrounding patient privacy.  Compliance with current and future HIPAA and HITECH requirements or any other federal or state privacy initiatives could require VITAS to make substantial investments, which could negatively impact its profitability and cash flows.  16 VITAS’ growth strategies may not be successful, which could adversely affect its business. A significant element of VITAS’ growth strategy is expected to include expansion of its business in new and existing markets.  This aspect of VITAS’ growth strategy may not be successful, which could adversely impact its growth and profitability.  We cannot assure you that VITAS will be able to: Identify markets that meet its selection criteria for new hospice locations; Hire and retain qualified management teams to operate each of its new hospice locations; Manage a large and geographically diverse group of hospice locations; Become Medicare and Medicaid certified in new markets; Generate sufficient hospice admissions to operate profitably in these new markets; Compete effectively with existing hospices in new markets; or Obtain state licensure and/or a certificate of need from appropriate state agencies in new markets. VITAS’ loss of key management personnel or its inability to hire and retain skilled employees could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. VITAS’ future success significantly depends upon the continued service of its senior management personnel.  The loss of one or more of VITAS’ key senior management personnel or its inability to hire and retain new skilled employees could negatively impact VITAS’ ability to maintain or increase patient referrals, a key aspect of its growth strategy, and could adversely affect its future operating results.  Competition for skilled employees is intense, and the process of locating and recruiting skilled employees with the combination of qualifications and attributes required to care effectively for terminally ill patients and their families can be difficult and lengthy.  We cannot assure you that VITAS will be successful in attracting, retaining or training highly skilled nursing, management, community education, operations, admissions and other personnel.  VITAS’ business could be disrupted and its growth and profitability negatively impacted if it is unable to attract and retain skilled employees. A nationwide shortage of qualified nurses and aides could adversely affect VITAS’ profitability, growth and ability to continue to provide quality, responsive hospice services to its patients as nursing and health aides’ wages and benefits increase.  A significant portion of VITAS’ workforce is licensed nurses.  VITAS depends on qualified nurses to provide quality, responsive hospice services to its patients.  The current nationwide shortage of qualified nurses impacts some of the markets in which VITAS provides hospice services.  In response to this shortage, VITAS has adjusted its wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and to engage contract nurses.  Similarly, due to the pandemic, there is currently a shortage of home health aides, who provide many of the hospice services provided by VITAS.  VITAS has also adjusted its wages and benefits to recruit and retain home health and other aides.  VITAS’ inability to attract and retain qualified nurses and aides as well as other healthcare workers, could adversely affect its ability to provide quality, responsive hospice services to its patients and its ability to increase or maintain patient census in those markets.  Increases in the wages and benefits required to attract and retain qualified nurses or an increase in reliance on contract nurses could negatively impact profitability. VITAS may not be able to compete successfully against other hospice providers, and competitive pressures may limit its ability to maintain or increase its market position, which could adversely affect its profitability, financial condition and cash flows. Hospice care in the United States is highly competitive.  In many areas in which VITAS’ hospices are located, they compete with a large number of organizations, including: Community-based hospice providers; National and regional companies; Hospital-based hospice and palliative care programs; Physician groups; 17  Nursing homes; Home health agencies; Infusion therapy companies; and Nursing agencies. Various health care companies have diversified into the hospice industry and there is an increasing consolidation across hospice industry.  Other companies, including hospitals and health care organizations that are not currently providing hospice care, may enter the markets VITAS serves and expand the variety of services offered to include hospice care.  We cannot assure you that VITAS will not encounter increased competition in the future that could limit its ability to maintain or increase its market position, including competition from parties in a position to impact referrals to VITAS.  Such increased competition could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business, financial condition and results of operations. If VITAS fails to comply with the terms of the CIA, it could be subject to substantial monetary penalties or suspension or exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.   VITAS and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a CIA with the Office of the OIG on October 30, 2017 in connection with the settlement of a False Claims Act case.  The CIA formalizes various aspects of VITAS’ already existing compliance program and contains requirements designed to document compliance with federal healthcare program requirements. It has a term of five years during which it imposes monitoring, reporting, certification, oversight, screening and training obligations, certain of which had previously been implemented by VITAS and certain of the obligations extend beyond the five-year term. It also required VITAS to engage an Independent Review Organization to perform auditing and review functions and to prepare reports regarding compliance with federal healthcare programs.  In the event of breach of the CIA, VITAS could become liable for payment of stipulated penalties or could be excluded from participation in federal healthcare programs.  Changes in rates or methods of payment for VITAS’ services could adversely affect its revenues and profits.  Managed care organizations have grown substantially in terms of the percentage of the population they cover and their control over an increasing portion of the health care economy.  Managed care organizations have continued to consolidate to enhance their ability to influence the delivery of health care services and to exert pressure to control health care costs.  VITAS has a number of contractual arrangements with managed care organizations and other similar parties. VITAS provides hospice care to many Medicare beneficiaries who have elected Medicare managed care.  Under such contracts between HMOs and the federal Department of Health and Human Services, the Medicare payments for hospice services are excluded from the per-member, per-month payment from Medicare to HMOs and instead are paid directly by Medicare to the hospices.  As a result, VITAS’ payments for Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare risk HMOs are processed in the same way with the same rates as other Medicare beneficiaries.  We cannot assure, however, that payment for hospice services will continue to be excluded from HMO payment under Medicare risk contracts and similar Medicare managed care plans or that if not excluded, managed care organizations or other large third-party payors would not use their power to influence and exert pressure on health care providers to reduce costs in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business, financial condition and results of operations.  Liability claims may have an adverse effect on VITAS, and its insurance coverage may be inadequate. Participants in the hospice industry are subject to lawsuits alleging negligence, professional liability, wage and hour or other similar legal theories, many of which involve large claims and significant defense costs.  Additionally, the pandemic may lead to different claims or a higher volume of claims than we typically face.  We are also subject to the risk of lawsuits under the False Claims Act and comparable state laws for allegedly submitting fraudulent bills for services to the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other federal and state healthcare programs.  These lawsuits, which may be initiated by “whistleblowers”, subpoenas or Civil Investigative Demands can involve significant monetary damages, fines, attorneys’ fees and the award of bounties to private qui tam plaintiffs. From time to time, VITAS is subject to such claims and other types of lawsuits.  See the description below under Legal Proceedings in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  The ultimate liability for claims, if any, could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or operating results.  Although VITAS currently maintains liability insurance intended to cover certain claims, we cannot assure you that the coverage limits of such insurance policies will be adequate or that all such claims will be covered by the insurance.  In addition, VITAS’ insurance policies must be renewed annually and may be subject to cancellation during the policy period.  While VITAS has been able to obtain liability insurance in the past, such insurance varies in cost, and may not be available in the future on terms acceptable to VITAS, if at all.  18 A successful claim in excess of the insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on VITAS.  Claims, regardless of their merit or eventual outcome, also may have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business and reputation due to the costs of litigation, diversion of management’s time and related publicity. VITAS procures professional liability coverage on a claims-made basis.  The insurance contracts specify that coverage is available only during the term of each insurance contract.  VITAS’ management intends to renew or replace the existing claims-made policy annually but such coverage is difficult to obtain, may be subject to cancellation and may be written by carriers that are unable, or unwilling to pay claims. Additionally, some risks and liabilities, including claims for punitive damages, are not covered by insurance.  Cybersecurity  In the normal course of business, our information technology systems hold sensitive patient information including patient demographic data, eligibility for various medical plans including Medicare and Medicaid and protected health information.  We utilize those same systems to perform our day-to-day activities, such as receiving referrals, assigning medical teams to patients, documenting medical information and maintaining an accurate record of all transactions.  Recently healthcare organizations have been the focus of increased cybersecurity attacks.  We have not experienced any known attacks on our information technology systems that have compromised patient data or the Company’s proprietary data.  We maintain our information technology systems with safeguard protection against cyber-attacks including active intrusion protection, firewalls and virus detection software.  As discussed previously, we are subject to and comply with HIPAA and HITECH regulations.  We have developed and tested a response plan in the event of a successful attack and we maintain commercial insurance related to a cyber-attack. We obtain internal control reports from key vendors that maintain company data or process company transactions on a yearly basis.  We review these reports to detect any potential cybersecurity issues.  However, these safeguards do not ensure that a significant cyber-attack could not occur.  Increases in working from home and the provision of telehealth services due to the pandemic have significantly increased our usage of information technology systems and heightened the need for security of those systems.  A successful attack on our information technology systems could have significant consequences to the business including liability for compromised patient information and business interruption. We are regularly the target of attempted cyber and other security threats and must continuously monitor and develop our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent, detect, address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact.  Insider or employee cyber and security threats are increasingly a concern for all large companies, including ours. VITAS’ success is highly dependent on its brand reputation VITAS’ reputation for performing quality routine and high acuity patient hospice care within the regulations mandated by Medicare, Medicaid and commercial payors is critical to our success.  Failure to provide quality patient care within the regulations mandated by our third-party payors, or the perception of inappropriate care resulting in adverse publicity, litigation or a campaign of negative on-line reviews are some of the factors that could negatively impact VITAS’ national reputation.  VITAS maintains a reputation management risk program however, a loss of brand reputation at VITAS could adversely affect referral sources’ willingness to refer our service and thus, adversely affect our future operating performance. VITAS’ headquarters and a significant portion of its operations are in south Florida The occurrence of a natural disaster in any region that VITAS has significant operations could have a negative impact on the business.  VITAS’ headquarters are located in Miami, Florida.  In addition, two of our largest programs and an office complex are in south Florida.  The location of our headquarters and these large programs increases our exposure to hurricanes.  A major hurricane in south Florida could impede our ability to bill for our services, operate our businesses and serve our patients in the affected area.  VITAS maintains a disaster recovery program to mitigate this risk; however, natural disasters could have an adverse effect on our future operating performance. GENERAL The agreements and instruments governing borrowing capacity contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business and adversely affect the price of our Capital Stock. The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our instruments of indebtedness restrict our ability to incur additional debt; issue and sell capital stock of subsidiaries; sell assets; engage in transactions with affiliates; restrict distributions from subsidiaries; incur liens; engage in business other than permitted businesses; engage in sale/leaseback transactions; engage in mergers or consolidations; make capital expenditures; make guarantees; make investments and acquisitions; enter into operating leases; hedge interest rates; and prepay other debt.  19 Moreover, if we are unable to meet the terms of the financial covenants or if we breach any of these covenants, a default could result under one or more of these agreements.  A default, if not waived by our lenders, could accelerate repayment of our outstanding indebtedness.  If acceleration occurs, we may not be able to repay our debt and it is unlikely that we would be able to borrow sufficient additional funds to refinance such debt on acceptable terms.  In the event of any default under our credit facilities, the lenders thereunder could elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, to be due and payable, and to require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings, any of which would be an event of default. We depend on our management team and the loss of their service could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of our executive management team.  The loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract or retain other skilled personnel in the future.  Environmental and safety compliance costs and liabilities could increase our expenses and adversely affect our financial condition. Our operations are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that prohibit or restrict the discharge of pollutants into the environment and regulate employee exposure to hazardous substance in the workplace.  Failure to comply with these laws could subject us to material costs and liabilities, including civil and criminal fines, costs to cleanup contamination we cause and, in some circumstances, costs to cleanup contamination we discover on our own property but did not cause. Because we use and generate hazardous materials in some of our operations, we are potentially subject to material liabilities relating to the cleanup of contamination and personal injury claims.  In addition, we have retained certain environmental liabilities in connection with the sale of former businesses.  We are currently funding the cleanup of historical contamination at one of our former properties and contributing to the cleanup of third-party sites as a result of our sale of our former subsidiary DuBois Chemicals Inc.  Although we have established a reserve for these liabilities, actual cleanup costs may exceed our current estimates due to factors beyond our control, such as the discovery of additional contamination or the enforcement of more stringent cleanup requirements.  New laws and regulations or their stricter enforcement, the discovery of presently unknown conditions or the receipt of additional claims for indemnification could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities including impairment of our brand that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to certain anti-takeover statutes that might make it more difficult to effect a change in control of the Company. We are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits us from engaging in a “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.  The application of Section 203 could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control that could be advantageous to stockholders. Additionally, the FTC and other antitrust regulators have recently heightened their scrutiny of both horizontal and vertical merges in healthcare which could delay or prevent potential acquisitions, divestitures or a change in control.  An adverse ruling against us in certain litigation could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We are involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of our business currently and from time to time.  The damages claimed against us in some of these cases can be substantial.  See the “Legal Proceedings” sections of this 10-K and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of particular matters. We cannot assure you that we will prevail in pending cases.  Regardless of the outcome, such litigation is costly to manage, investigate and defend, and the related defense costs, diversion of management’s time and related publicity may adversely affect the conduct of our business and the results of our operations. We have historically incurred debt to finance the operations of the Company.   The Company has historically had debt service obligations and has the ability through its existing credit facility to incur debt that may restrict our operating flexibility.  We cannot assure you that our cash flow from operations would be sufficient to service our future operating needs, which would require us to borrow additional funds, or restructure or otherwise refinance our debt.  In addition, the Company has the ability to expand its existing debt and borrowing capacity subject to various restrictions and covenants defined by its creditors.  The interest rate the Company pays will fluctuate from time to time based upon a number of factors including current SOFR rates and Company operating performance.  Significant changes in these factors could result in a material change in the Company’s interest expense.  20 Our future ability to repay or to refinance our indebtedness and to pay interest on our indebtedness will depend on our operating performance, which may be affected by factors beyond our control.  These factors could include operating difficulties, increased operating costs, our competitors’ actions and regulatory developments.  Our ability to meet our debt service and other obligations may depend in significant part on the extent to which we successfully implement our business strategy.  We cannot assure you that we will be able to implement our strategy fully or that the anticipated results of our strategy will be realized.  Credit market conditions may make it difficult for us to obtain new financing or refinance our current debt on terms and conditions acceptable to us. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our potential debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional equity capital or restructure our debt.  We cannot assure you that our cash flows and capital resources would be sufficient to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness in the future or that alternative measures would successfully meet our debt service obligations. Issues associated with the actual or perceived effects of COVID-19 or another epidemic, pandemic, or similar widespread public health concern, could adversely affect our businesses. Our businesses may be negatively impacted by the fear of exposure to or actual effects of COVID-19 or another epidemic, pandemic, or similar widespread public health concern.  Negative impacts may include, but not be limited to: restrictions or limitations on our ability to continue operations and service our patients and customers in-person, changes in demand for our services or mix of services demanded, additional costs for personal protection equipment and other items or processes necessitated to maintain the health and safety of our employees, customers and patients, isolated outbreaks of disease that may affect our ability to provide services in certain areas for a period of time, and increasing difficulty in our ability to hire employees to provide in-person services for our patients and customers during the pendency of any public health concern.  Despite our efforts to manage and remedy these impacts, their ultimate impact also depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of any such outbreak as well as third-party actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects"
4,CHE,CHEMED CORP,2022-02-28,"Risk Factors
 You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in evaluating us and our Capital Stock.  They are not the only ones facing the Company.  Other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. We continue to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business and geographies, including how it will impact our customers, team members, suppliers, vendors, business partners and distribution channels.  The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption, which has and will continue to adversely affect our business operations and may materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. For additional information regarding specific risk factors related to COVID-19 pandemic, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation under Part I., Item 2 of this Annual Report on Form-10K.   ROTO-ROOTER We face intense competition from numerous, fragmented competitors.  If we do not compete effectively, our business may suffer. We face intense competition from numerous competitors.  The sewer, drain and pipe cleaning, excavation, plumbing repair and water restoration businesses are highly fragmented, with the bulk of the competitors consisting of local and regional entities.  We compete primarily on the basis of advertising, range of services provided, name recognition, availability of emergency service, speed and quality of customer service, service guarantees and pricing.  Our competitors may succeed in developing new or enhanced products  13and services more successful than ours and in marketing and selling existing and new products and services better than we do.  In addition, new competitors may emerge.  We cannot make any assurances that we will continue to be able to compete successfully with any of these companies.   Our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations, exposing us to potential claims and compliance costs that could adversely affect our business. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to franchising, insurance and other aspects of our business.  These are discussed in greater detail under “Government Regulations” in the Description of Business section hereof.  If we fail to comply with existing or future laws and regulations, we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines and sanctions.  Our franchising activities are subject to various federal and state franchising laws and regulations, including the rules and regulations of the FTC regarding the offering or sale of franchises.  These rules and regulations require us to provide all of our prospective franchisees with specific information regarding us and our franchise program in the form of a detailed franchise offering circular.  In addition, a number of states require us to register our franchise offering prior to offering or selling franchises in such states.  Various state laws also provide for certain rights in favor of franchisees, including (i) limitations on the franchisor’s ability to terminate a franchise except for good cause, (ii) restrictions on the franchisor’s ability to deny renewal of a franchise, (iii) circumstances under which the franchisor may be required to purchase certain inventory of franchisees when a franchise is terminated or not renewed in violation of such laws and (iv) provisions relating to arbitration.  The ability to engage in the plumbing repair business is also subject to certain limitations and restrictions imposed by the state and local licensing laws and regulations.   We cannot predict what legislation or regulations affecting our business will be enacted in the future, how existing or future laws or regulations will be enforced, administered and interpreted, or the amount of future expenditures that may be required to comply with these laws or regulations.  Compliance costs associated with governmental regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Roto-Rooter’s loss of key management personnel or its inability to hire and retain skilled employees could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. Roto-Rooter’s future success significantly depends upon the continued service of its senior management personnel.  The loss of one or more of Roto-Rooter’s key senior management personnel or its inability to hire and retain new skilled employees could negatively impact its ability to maintain or increase customer calls and jobs, a key aspect of its growth strategy, and could adversely affect its future operating results. Competition for skilled employees, particularly licensed plumbers, is intense, and the process of locating and recruiting skilled employees with the combination of qualifications and attributes required to adequately perform plumbing duties can be difficult and lengthy.  We cannot assure you that Roto-Rooter will be successful in attracting, retaining or training highly skilled personnel.  Roto-Rooter’s business could be disrupted and its growth and profitability negatively impacted if it is unable to attract and retain skilled employees.   Additionally, throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, rules and regulations have been promulgated that could affect the ability for Roto-Rooter to hire new or retain current employees, particularly if those employees have decided not to get vaccinated against COVID-19.  In the event that new rules or regulations are promulgated that regulate the ability of employees to continue to be employed in the event that they are not vaccinated, or be employed only under certain testing or other restrictions, Roto-Rooter could lose a significant percentage of its workforce, particularly in the event that the terms of the rules or regulations would treat Roto-Rooter differently than its competitors.  Such a loss could have a material adverse effect on Roto-Rooter’s ability to service its customers and on its revenues Cybersecurity Our information technology systems hold sensitive customer information in the ordinary course of business, including names, addresses, and partial credit card information.  Additionally, we utilize those same systems to perform our day-to-day activities, such as receiving customer calls, dispatching technicians to jobs, and maintaining an accurate record of all transactions.  We have not experienced any known system/data breaches on our information technology systems that compromised customer data or the company’s proprietary data.  We maintain our information technology systems with safeguard protection against cyber-attacks, including intrusion detection and protection services, firewalls, and virus detection software.  Additionally, every month, we test our information technology systems using cyber-scanning software and other methods to learn how a successful system/data breach may occur. If a deficiency is detected, our IT staff will log and remediate the deficiency prescribed by the vendor or manufacturer.  Roto-Rooter has developed and tested a response plan in the event of a successful system/data breach and maintains commercial insurance related to cyber-security. Additionally, we obtain internal control reports from key vendors that maintain company data or process company transactions on a yearly basis.  We review these reports to detect any potential cybersecurity issues. However, these safeguards do not ensure that a significant system/data breach may occur.  Due to the pandemic, certain roles have been conducted remotely, increasing the role and  14importance of our information technology and security systems.  A successful attack on our information technology systems could significantly affect the business, including liability for compromised customer information and business interruption. Roto-Rooter’s success is highly dependent on its brand reputation Roto-Rooter’s national reputation and brand image for performing necessary, high quality services in a timely manner is critical to Roto-Rooter’s continued success.  Adverse publicity, litigation or on-line negative reviews focused on the Roto-Rooter brand could negatively impact Roto-Rooter’s national reputation resulting in decreased future demand for Roto-Rooter branded services.  Roto-Rooter maintains a reputation management risk program, however, a loss of brand reputation at Roto-Rooter could adversely affect consumer willingness to use our service and thus, adversely affect our future operating performance. VITAS  VITAS is highly dependent on payments from Medicare and Medicaid.  If there are changes in the rate or methods governing these payments, VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profits could materially decline. In excess of 90% of VITAS’ net patient service revenue consists of payments from the Medicare and Medicaid programs.  Such payments are made primarily on a “per diem” basis, subject to annual reimbursement caps.  Because VITAS receives a per diem fee to provide eligible services to all patients, VITAS’ profitability is largely dependent upon its ability to manage the costs of providing hospice services to patients.  Increases in operating costs, such as labor and supply costs that are subject to inflation, without a compensating increase in Medicare and Medicaid rates, could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business in the future.  Additionally, regulators are increasing scrutiny of claims, including through the new TPE program, which may require additional resources to respond to audits, and which may cause additional delays or denials in receiving payments.  Medicare and Medicaid currently adjust the various hospice payment rates annually based primarily on the increase or decrease of the hospital wage index basket, regionally adjusted.  However, the increases may be less than actual inflation.  VITAS’ profitability could be negatively impacted if this adjustment were eliminated or reduced, or if VITAS’ costs of providing hospice services increased more than the annual adjustment.  In addition, cost pressures resulting from shorter patient lengths of stay and the use of more expensive forms of palliative care, including drugs and drug delivery systems, could negatively impact VITAS’ profitability.  Many payors are increasing pressure to control health care costs.  The U.S. federal budget remains in flux, which could, among other things, cut Medicare payments to providers.  The Medicare program is frequently mentioned as a target for spending cuts and within the Medicare program the hospice benefit is often specifically targeted for cuts and a lowering of the Medicare Caps.  The full impact on our business of any future cuts in Medicare (including lowering of the Medicare Caps) or other programs is uncertain.  In addition, both public and private payors are increasing pressure to decrease, or limit increases in, reimbursement rates for health care services.  VITAS’ levels of revenue and profitability will be subject to the effect of possible reductions in coverage or payment rates by third-party payors, including payment rates from Medicare and Medicaid. Each state that maintains a Medicaid program has the option to provide reimbursement for hospice services at reimbursement rates generally required to be at least as much as Medicare rates.  All states in which VITAS operates cover Medicaid hospice services; however, we cannot assure you that the states in which VITAS is presently operating or states into which VITAS could expand operations will continue to cover Medicaid hospice services.  In addition, the Medicare and Medicaid programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive and prospective rate and payment adjustments, administrative rulings, freezes and funding reductions, all of which may adversely affect the level of program payments and could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business.  We cannot assure that Medicare and/or Medicaid payments to hospices will not decrease.  Reductions in amounts paid by government programs for services or changes in methods or regulations governing payments could cause VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profits to materially decline. 15% to 20% of VITAS’ days of care are provided to patients who reside in nursing homes. Changes in the laws and regulations regarding payments for hospice services and “room and board” provided to VITAS’ hospice patients residing in nursing homes could reduce its net patient service revenue and profitability. For VITAS’ hospice patients receiving nursing home care under certain state Medicaid programs who elect hospice care under Medicare and Medicaid, the state generally must pay VITAS, in addition to the applicable Medicare or Medicaid hospice per diem rate, an amount equal to at least 95% of the Medicaid per diem nursing home rate for “room and board” furnished to the patient by the nursing home.  VITAS contracts with various nursing homes for the nursing homes’ provision of certain “room and board” services that the nursing homes would otherwise provide Medicaid nursing home patients.  VITAS bills and collects from the applicable state Medicaid program an amount equal to approximately 95% of the amount that would otherwise have been paid directly to the nursing home under the state’s Medicaid plan.  Under VITAS’ standard nursing home contracts, it pays the nursing home for these “room and board” services at approximately 100% of the Medicaid per diem nursing home rate.  15 The reduction or elimination of Medicare and Medicaid payments for hospice patients residing in nursing homes would reduce VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profitability.  In addition, changes in the way nursing homes are reimbursed for “room and board” services provided to hospice patients residing in nursing homes could affect VITAS’ ability to serve patients in nursing homes.  If VITAS is unable to maintain relationships with existing patient referral sources or to establish new referral sources, VITAS’ growth and profitability could be adversely affected.  VITAS’ success is heavily dependent on referrals from physicians, long-term care facilities, hospitals and other institutional health care providers, managed care companies, insurance companies and other patient referral sources in the communities that its hospice locations serve, as well as on its ability to maintain good relations with these referral sources.  VITAS’ referral sources may refer their patients to other hospice care providers or not to a hospice provider at all.  Additionally, because of the pandemic, VITAS has experienced significant changes in referral patterns and sources.  VITAS’ growth and profitability depend significantly on its ability to establish and maintain close working relationships with these patient referral sources and to increase awareness and acceptance of hospice care by its referral sources and their patients.  We cannot assure that VITAS will be able to maintain its existing relationships or that it will be able to develop and maintain new relationships in existing or new markets.  Moreover, if pandemic-related shifts to referrals continue, it could materially adversely affect the business.  VITAS’ loss of existing relationships or its failure to develop new relationships could adversely affect its ability to expand or maintain its operations and operate profitably.  Moreover, we cannot assure you that awareness or acceptance of hospice care will increase or remain at current levels.  VITAS operates in an industry that is subject to extensive government regulation and claims reviews, and changes in law and regulatory interpretations could reduce its net patient service revenue and profitability and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. The healthcare industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations relating to, among others: Payment for services; Conduct of operations, including fraud and abuse, anti-kickback prohibitions, self-referral prohibitions and false claims; Privacy and security of medical records; Employment practices; and Various state approval requirements, such as facility and professional licensure, certificate of need, compliance surveys and other certification or recertification requirements.  Changes in these laws, rules and regulations or their interpretations or methods of enforcement could reduce VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profitability, or increase VITAS’ liabilities, cost of compliance, or legal and other costs in defending any claims.  VITAS’ ability to comply with such regulations is a key factor in determining the success of its business.  See the “Government Regulations” section of this 10-K for a greater description of these matters.  VITAS maintains an internal regulatory compliance review program and from time to time retains regulatory counsel for guidance on compliance matters.  We cannot assure you, however, that VITAS’ practices, if reviewed, would be found to be in compliance with applicable health regulatory laws, as such laws ultimately may be interpreted, or that any non-compliance with such laws would not have a material adverse effect on VITAS. Federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives could require VITAS to expend substantial sums on acquiring, implementing and supporting new information systems, which could negatively impact its profitability and cash flows. There are currently numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives at both the state and federal levels that address patient privacy concerns.  We cannot predict the total financial or other impact of the regulations on VITAS’ operations.  In addition, although VITAS’ management believes it is in compliance with the requirement of patient privacy regulations, we cannot assure you that VITAS will not be found to have violated state and federal laws, rules or guidelines surrounding patient privacy.  Compliance with current and future HIPAA and HITECH requirements or any other federal or state privacy initiatives could require VITAS to make substantial investments, which could negatively impact its profitability and cash flows.  16 VITAS’ growth strategies may not be successful, which could adversely affect its business. A significant element of VITAS’ growth strategy is expected to include expansion of its business in new and existing markets.  This aspect of VITAS’ growth strategy may not be successful, which could adversely impact its growth and profitability.  We cannot assure you that VITAS will be able to: Identify markets that meet its selection criteria for new hospice locations; Hire and retain qualified management teams to operate each of its new hospice locations; Manage a large and geographically diverse group of hospice locations; Become Medicare and Medicaid certified in new markets; Generate sufficient hospice admissions to operate profitably in these new markets; Compete effectively with existing hospices in new markets; or Obtain state licensure and/or a certificate of need from appropriate state agencies in new markets. VITAS’ loss of key management personnel or its inability to hire and retain skilled employees could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. VITAS’ future success significantly depends upon the continued service of its senior management personnel.  The loss of one or more of VITAS’ key senior management personnel or its inability to hire and retain new skilled employees could negatively impact VITAS’ ability to maintain or increase patient referrals, a key aspect of its growth strategy, and could adversely affect its future operating results.  Competition for skilled employees is intense, and the process of locating and recruiting skilled employees with the combination of qualifications and attributes required to care effectively for terminally ill patients and their families can be difficult and lengthy.  We cannot assure you that VITAS will be successful in attracting, retaining or training highly skilled nursing, management, community education, operations, admissions and other personnel.  VITAS’ business could be disrupted and its growth and profitability negatively impacted if it is unable to attract and retain skilled employees. A nationwide shortage of qualified nurses and aides could adversely affect VITAS’ profitability, growth and ability to continue to provide quality, responsive hospice services to its patients as nursing and health aides’ wages and benefits increase.  A significant portion of VITAS’ workforce is licensed nurses.  VITAS depends on qualified nurses to provide quality, responsive hospice services to its patients.  The current nationwide shortage of qualified nurses impacts some of the markets in which VITAS provides hospice services.  In response to this shortage, VITAS has adjusted its wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and to engage contract nurses.  Similarly, due to the pandemic, there is currently a shortage of home health aides, who provide many of the hospice services provided by VITAS.  VITAS has also adjusted its wages and benefits to recruit and retain home health and other aides.  VITAS’ inability to attract and retain qualified nurses and aides could adversely affect its ability to provide quality, responsive hospice services to its patients and its ability to increase or maintain patient census in those markets.  Increases in the wages and benefits required to attract and retain qualified nurses or an increase in reliance on contract nurses could negatively impact profitability. VITAS may not be able to compete successfully against other hospice providers, and competitive pressures may limit its ability to maintain or increase its market position, which could adversely affect its profitability, financial condition and cash flows. Hospice care in the United States is highly competitive.  In many areas in which VITAS’ hospices are located, they compete with a large number of organizations, including: Community-based hospice providers; National and regional companies; Hospital-based hospice and palliative care programs; Physician groups; 17  Nursing homes; Home health agencies; Infusion therapy companies; and Nursing agencies. Various health care companies have diversified into the hospice industry and there is an increasing consolidation across hospice industry.  Other companies, including hospitals and health care organizations that are not currently providing hospice care, may enter the markets VITAS serves and expand the variety of services offered to include hospice care.  We cannot assure you that VITAS will not encounter increased competition in the future that could limit its ability to maintain or increase its market position, including competition from parties in a position to impact referrals to VITAS.  Such increased competition could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business, financial condition and results of operations. If VITAS fails to comply with the terms of the CIA, it could be subject to substantial monetary penalties or suspension or exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.   VITAS and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a CIA with the Office of the OIG on October 30, 2017 in connection with the settlement of a False Claims Act case.  The CIA formalizes various aspects of VITAS’ already existing compliance program and contains requirements designed to document compliance with federal healthcare program requirements. It has a term of five years during which it imposes monitoring, reporting, certification, oversight, screening and training obligations, certain of which had previously been implemented by VITAS.  It also required VITAS to engage an Independent Review Organization to perform auditing and review functions and to prepare reports regarding compliance with federal healthcare programs.  In the event of breach of the CIA, VITAS could become liable for payment of stipulated penalties or could be excluded from participation in federal healthcare programs.  Changes in rates or methods of payment for VITAS’ services could adversely affect its revenues and profits.  Managed care organizations have grown substantially in terms of the percentage of the population they cover and their control over an increasing portion of the health care economy.  Managed care organizations have continued to consolidate to enhance their ability to influence the delivery of health care services and to exert pressure to control health care costs.  VITAS has a number of contractual arrangements with managed care organizations and other similar parties. VITAS provides hospice care to many Medicare beneficiaries who have elected Medicare managed care.  Under such contracts between HMOs and the federal Department of Health and Human Services, the Medicare payments for hospice services are excluded from the per-member, per-month payment from Medicare to HMOs and instead are paid directly by Medicare to the hospices.  As a result, VITAS’ payments for Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare risk HMOs are processed in the same way with the same rates as other Medicare beneficiaries.  We cannot assure, however, that payment for hospice services will continue to be excluded from HMO payment under Medicare risk contracts and similar Medicare managed care plans or that if not excluded, managed care organizations or other large third-party payors would not use their power to influence and exert pressure on health care providers to reduce costs in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business, financial condition and results of operations.  Liability claims may have an adverse effect on VITAS, and its insurance coverage may be inadequate. Participants in the hospice industry are subject to lawsuits alleging negligence, professional liability, wage and hour or other similar legal theories, many of which involve large claims and significant defense costs.  Additionally, the pandemic may lead to different claims or a higher volume of claims than we typically face.  We are also subject to the risk of lawsuits under the False Claims Act and comparable state laws for allegedly submitting fraudulent bills for services to the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other federal and state healthcare programs.  These lawsuits, which may be initiated by “whistleblowers”, subpoenas or Civil Investigative Demands can involve significant monetary damages, fines, attorneys’ fees and the award of bounties to private qui tam plaintiffs. From time to time, VITAS is subject to such claims and other types of lawsuits.  See the description below under Legal Proceedings in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  The ultimate liability for claims, if any, could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or operating results.  Although VITAS currently maintains liability insurance intended to cover certain claims, we cannot assure you that the coverage limits of such insurance policies will be adequate or that all such claims will be covered by the insurance.  In addition, VITAS’ insurance policies must be renewed annually and may be subject to cancellation during the policy period.  While VITAS has been able to obtain liability insurance in the past, such insurance varies in cost, and may not be available in the future on terms acceptable to VITAS, if at all.  18 A successful claim in excess of the insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on VITAS.  Claims, regardless of their merit or eventual outcome, also may have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business and reputation due to the costs of litigation, diversion of management’s time and related publicity. VITAS procures professional liability coverage on a claims-made basis.  The insurance contracts specify that coverage is available only during the term of each insurance contract.  VITAS’ management intends to renew or replace the existing claims-made policy annually but such coverage is difficult to obtain, may be subject to cancellation and may be written by carriers that are unable, or unwilling to pay claims. Additionally, some risks and liabilities, including claims for punitive damages, are not covered by insurance.  Cybersecurity  In the normal course of business, our information technology systems hold sensitive patient information including patient demographic data, eligibility for various medical plans including Medicare and Medicaid and protected health information.  Additionally, we utilize those same systems to perform our day-to-day activities, such as receiving referrals, assigning medical teams to patients, documenting medical information and maintaining an accurate record of all transactions.  Recently healthcare organizations have been the focus of increased cybersecurity attacks.  We have not experienced any known attacks on our information technology systems that have compromised patient data or the Company’s proprietary data.  We maintain our information technology systems with safeguard protection against cyber-attacks including active intrusion protection, firewalls and virus detection software.  As discussed previously, we are subject to and comply with HIPAA and HITECH regulations.  We have developed and tested a response plan in the event of a successful attack and we maintain commercial insurance related to a cyber-attack. Additionally, we obtain internal control reports from key vendors that maintain company data or process company transactions on a yearly basis.  We review these reports to detect any potential cybersecurity issues.  However, these safeguards do not ensure that a significant cyber-attack could not occur.  Increases in working from home and the provision of telehealth services due to the pandemic have significantly increased our usage of information technology systems and heightened the need for security of those systems.  A successful attack on our information technology systems could have significant consequences to the business including liability for compromised patient information and business interruption. We are regularly the target of attempted cyber and other security threats and must continuously monitor and develop our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent, detect, address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact.  Insider or employee cyber and security threats are increasingly a concern for all large companies, including ours. VITAS’ success is highly dependent on its brand reputation VITAS’ reputation for performing quality routine and high acuity patient hospice care within the regulations mandated by Medicare, Medicaid and commercial payors is critical to our success.  Failure to provide quality patient care within the regulations mandated by our third-party payors, or the perception of inappropriate care resulting in adverse publicity, litigation or a campaign of negative on-line reviews are some of the factors that could negatively impact VITAS’ national reputation.  VITAS maintains a reputation management risk program however, a loss of brand reputation at VITAS could adversely affect referral sources’ willingness to refer our service and thus, adversely affect our future operating performance. VITAS’ headquarters and a significant portion of its operations are in south Florida The occurrence of a natural disaster in any region that VITAS has significant operations could have a negative impact on the business.  VITAS’ headquarters are located in Miami, Florida.  In addition, two of our largest programs and an office complex are in south Florida.  The location of our headquarters and these large programs increases our exposure to hurricanes.  A major hurricane in south Florida could impede our ability to bill for our services, operate our businesses and serve our patients in the affected area.  VITAS maintains a disaster recovery program to mitigate this risk; however, natural disasters could have an adverse effect on our future operating performance. GENERAL The agreements and instruments governing borrowing capacity contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business and adversely affect the price of our Capital Stock. The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our instruments of indebtedness restrict our ability to incur additional debt; issue and sell capital stock of subsidiaries; sell assets; engage in transactions with affiliates; restrict distributions from subsidiaries; incur liens; engage in business other than permitted businesses; engage in sale/leaseback transactions; engage in mergers or consolidations; make capital expenditures; make guarantees; make investments and acquisitions; enter into operating leases; hedge interest rates; and prepay other debt. 19 Moreover, if we are unable to meet the terms of the financial covenants or if we breach any of these covenants, a default could result under one or more of these agreements.  A default, if not waived by our lenders, could accelerate repayment of our outstanding indebtedness.  If acceleration occurs, we may not be able to repay our debt and it is unlikely that we would be able to borrow sufficient additional funds to refinance such debt on acceptable terms.  In the event of any default under our credit facilities, the lenders thereunder could elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, to be due and payable, and to require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings, any of which would be an event of default. We depend on our management team and the loss of their service could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of our executive management team.  The loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract or retain other skilled personnel in the future.  Environmental and safety compliance costs and liabilities could increase our expenses and adversely affect our financial condition. Our operations are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that prohibit or restrict the discharge of pollutants into the environment and regulate employee exposure to hazardous substance in the workplace.  Failure to comply with these laws could subject us to material costs and liabilities, including civil and criminal fines, costs to cleanup contamination we cause and, in some circumstances, costs to cleanup contamination we discover on our own property but did not cause. Because we use and generate hazardous materials in some of our operations, we are potentially subject to material liabilities relating to the cleanup of contamination and personal injury claims.  In addition, we have retained certain environmental liabilities in connection with the sale of former businesses.  We are currently funding the cleanup of historical contamination at one of our former properties and contributing to the cleanup of third-party sites as a result of our sale of our former subsidiary DuBois Chemicals Inc.  Although we have established a reserve for these liabilities, actual cleanup costs may exceed our current estimates due to factors beyond our control, such as the discovery of additional contamination or the enforcement of more stringent cleanup requirements.  New laws and regulations or their stricter enforcement, the discovery of presently unknown conditions or the receipt of additional claims for indemnification could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities including impairment of our brand that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to certain anti-takeover statutes that might make it more difficult to effect a change in control of the Company. We are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits us from engaging in a “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.  The application of Section 203 could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control that could be advantageous to stockholders. An adverse ruling against us in certain litigation could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We are involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of our business currently and from time to time.  The damages claimed against us in some of these cases can be substantial.  See the “Legal Proceedings” sections of this 10-K and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of particular matters. We cannot assure you that we will prevail in pending cases.  Regardless of the outcome, such litigation is costly to manage, investigate and defend, and the related defense costs, diversion of management’s time and related publicity may adversely affect the conduct of our business and the results of our operations. We have historically incurred debt to finance the operations of the Company.   The Company has historically had debt service obligations and has the ability through its existing credit facility to incur debt that may restrict our operating flexibility.  We cannot assure you that our cash flow from operations would be sufficient to service our future operating needs, which would require us to borrow additional funds, or restructure or otherwise refinance our debt.  In addition, the Company has the ability to expand its existing debt and borrowing capacity subject to various restrictions and covenants defined by its creditors.  The interest rate the Company pays will fluctuate from time to time based upon a number of factors including current LIBOR rates and Company operating performance.  Significant changes in these factors could result in a material change in the Company’s interest expense. Our future ability to repay or to refinance our indebtedness and to pay interest on our indebtedness will depend on our operating performance, which may be affected by factors beyond our control.  These factors could include operating difficulties, increased  20operating costs, our competitors’ actions and regulatory developments.  Our ability to meet our debt service and other obligations may depend in significant part on the extent to which we successfully implement our business strategy.  We cannot assure you that we will be able to implement our strategy fully or that the anticipated results of our strategy will be realized.  Credit market conditions may make it difficult for us to obtain new financing or refinance our current debt on terms and conditions acceptable to us. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our potential debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional equity capital or restructure our debt.  We cannot assure you that our cash flows and capital resources would be sufficient to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness in the future or that alternative measures would successfully meet our debt service obligations. Issues associated with the actual or perceived effects of COVID-19 or another epidemic, pandemic, or similar widespread public health concern, could adversely affect our businesses. Our businesses may be negatively impacted by the fear of exposure to or actual effects of COVID-19 or another epidemic, pandemic, or similar widespread public health concern.  Negative impacts may include, but not be limited to: restrictions or limitations on our ability to continue operations and service our patients and customers in-person, changes in demand for our services or mix of services demanded, additional costs for PPE and other items or processes necessitated to maintain the health and safety of our employees, customers and patients, isolated outbreaks of disease that may affect our ability to provide services in certain areas for a period of time, and increasing difficulty in our ability to hire employees to provide in-person services for our patients and customers during the pendency of any public health concern.  Despite our efforts to manage and remedy these impacts, their ultimate impact also depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of any such outbreak as well as third-party actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects"
6,CHE,CHEMED CORP,2021-02-26,"Risk Factors
 You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in evaluating us and our Capital Stock.  They are not the only ones facing the Company.  Other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. We continue to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business and geographies, including how it will impact our customers, team members, suppliers, vendors, business partners and distribution channels.  The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption, which will adversely affect our business operations and may materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. For additional information regarding specific risk factors related to COVID-19 pandemic, see Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation under Part I., Item 2 of this Annual Report on Form-10K.   GENERAL The agreements and instruments governing borrowing capacity contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business and adversely affect the price of our Capital Stock. The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our instruments of indebtedness restrict our ability to incur additional debt; issue and sell capital stock of subsidiaries; sell assets; engage in transactions with affiliates; restrict distributions from subsidiaries; incur liens; engage in business other than permitted businesses; engage in sale/leaseback transactions; engage in mergers or consolidations; make capital expenditures; make guarantees; make investments and acquisitions; enter into operating leases; hedge interest rates; and prepay other debt.

Our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of our executive management team.  The loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract or retain other skilled personnel in the future.  Environmental and safety compliance costs and liabilities could increase our expenses and adversely affect our financial condition.

New laws and regulations or their stricter enforcement, the discovery of presently unknown conditions or the receipt of additional claims for indemnification could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities including impairment of our brand that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to certain anti-takeover statutes that might make it more difficult to effect a change in control of the Company. We are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits us from engaging in a “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.  The application of Section 203 could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control that could be advantageous to stockholders. An adverse ruling against us in certain litigation could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We are involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of our business currently and from time to time.  The damages claimed against us in some of these cases can be substantial.  See the “Legal Proceedings” sections of this 10-K and the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of particular matters. We cannot assure you that we will prevail in pending cases.  Regardless of the outcome, such litigation is costly to manage, investigate and defend, and the related defense costs, diversion of management’s time and related publicity may adversely affect the conduct of our business and the results of our operations. We have historically incurred debt to finance the operations of the Company.   The Company has historically had debt service obligations and has the ability through its existing credit facility to incur debt that may restrict our operating flexibility.  We cannot assure you that our cash flow from operations would be sufficient to service our future operating needs, which would require us to borrow additional funds, or restructure or otherwise refinance our debt.  In addition, the Company has the ability to expand its existing debt and borrowing capacity subject to various restrictions and covenants defined by its creditors.  The interest rate the Company pays will fluctuate from time to time based upon a number of factors including current LIBOR rates and Company operating performance.  Significant changes in these factors could result in a material change in the Company’s interest expense. Our future ability to repay or to refinance our indebtedness and to pay interest on our indebtedness will depend on our operating performance, which may be affected by factors beyond our control.  These factors could include operating difficulties, increased operating costs, our competitors’ actions and regulatory developments.  Our ability to meet our debt service and other obligations may depend in significant part on the extent to which we successfully implement our business strategy.  We cannot assure you that we will be able to implement our strategy fully or that the anticipated results of our strategy will be realized.  Credit market conditions may make it difficult for us to obtain new financing or refinance our current debt on terms and conditions acceptable to us. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our potential debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional equity capital or restructure our debt.  We cannot assure you that our  13cash flows and capital resources would be sufficient to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness in the future or that alternative measures would successfully meet our debt service obligations. Issues associated with the actual or perceived effects of COVID-19 or another epidemic, pandemic, or similar widespread public health concern, could adversely affect our businesses. Our businesses may be negatively impacted by the fear of exposure to or actual effects of COVID-19 or another epidemic, pandemic, or similar widespread public health concern.  Negative impacts may include, but not be limited to: restrictions or limitations on our ability to continue operations and service our patients and customers in-person, changes in demand for our services or mix of services demanded, additional costs for PPE and other items or processes necessitated to maintain the health and safety of our employees, customers and patients, isolated outbreaks of disease that may affect our ability to provide services in certain areas for a period of time, and increasing difficulty in our ability to hire employees to provide in-person services for our patients and customers during the pendency of any public health concern.  Despite our efforts to manage and remedy these impacts, their ultimate impact also depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of any such outbreak as well as third-party actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects. ROTO-ROOTER We face intense competition from numerous, fragmented competitors.  If we do not compete effectively, our business may suffer. We face intense competition from numerous competitors.  The sewer, drain and pipe cleaning, excavation, plumbing repair and water restoration businesses are highly fragmented, with the bulk of the industries consisting of local and regional competitors.  We compete primarily on the basis of advertising, range of services provided, name recognition, availability of emergency service, speed and quality of customer service, service guarantees and pricing.  Our competitors may succeed in developing new or enhanced products and services more successful than ours and in marketing and selling existing and new products and services better than we do.  In addition, new competitors may emerge.  We cannot make any assurances that we will continue to be able to compete successfully with any of these companies.   Our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations, exposing us to potential claims and compliance costs that could adversely affect our business. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to franchising, insurance and other aspects of our business.  These are discussed in greater detail under “Government Regulations” in the Description of Business section hereof.  If we fail to comply with existing or future laws and regulations, we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines and sanctions.  Our franchising activities are subject to various federal and state franchising laws and regulations, including the rules and regulations of the FTC regarding the offering or sale of franchises.  These rules and regulations require us to provide all of our prospective franchisees with specific information regarding us and our franchise program in the form of a detailed franchise offering circular.  In addition, a number of states require us to register our franchise offering prior to offering or selling franchises in such states.  Various state laws also provide for certain rights in favor of franchisees, including (i) limitations on the franchisor’s ability to terminate a franchise except for good cause, (ii) restrictions on the franchisor’s ability to deny renewal of a franchise, (iii) circumstances under which the franchisor may be required to purchase certain inventory of franchisees when a franchise is terminated or not renewed in violation of such laws and (iv) provisions relating to arbitration.  The ability to engage in the plumbing repair business is also subject to certain limitations and restrictions imposed by the state and local licensing laws and regulations.   We cannot predict what legislation or regulations affecting our business will be enacted in the future, how existing or future laws or regulations will be enforced, administered and interpreted, or the amount of future expenditures that may be required to comply with these laws or regulations.  Compliance costs associated with governmental regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Roto-Rooter’s loss of key management personnel or its inability to hire and retain skilled employees could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. Roto-Rooter’s future success significantly depends upon the continued service of its senior management personnel.  The loss of one or more of Roto-Rooter’s key senior management personnel or its inability to hire and retain new skilled employees could negatively impact its ability to maintain or increase customer calls and jobs, a key aspect of its growth strategy, and could adversely affect its future operating results.  14 Competition for skilled employees, particularly licensed plumbers, is intense, and the process of locating and recruiting skilled employees with the combination of qualifications and attributes required to adequately perform plumbing duties can be difficult and lengthy.  We cannot assure you that Roto-Rooter will be successful in attracting, retaining or training highly skilled personnel.  Roto-Rooter’s business could be disrupted and its growth and profitability negatively impacted if it is unable to attract and retain skilled employees.   Cybersecurity Our information technology systems hold sensitive customer information in the ordinary course of business, including names, addresses, and partial credit card information.  Additionally, we utilize those same systems to perform our day-to-day activities, such as receiving customer calls, dispatching technicians to jobs, and maintaining an accurate record of all transactions.  We have not experienced any known system/data breaches on our information technology systems that compromised customer data or the company’s proprietary data.  We maintain our information technology systems with safeguard protection against cyber-attacks, including intrusion detection and protection services, firewalls, and virus detection software.  Additionally, every quarter, we test our information technology systems using cyber-scanning software and other methods to learn how a successful system/data breach may occur. If a deficiency is detected, our IT staff will log and remediate the deficiency prescribed by the vendor or manufacturer.  Roto-Rooter has developed and tested a response plan in the event of a successful system/data breach and maintains commercial insurance related to cyber-security. Additionally, we obtain internal control reports from key vendors that maintain company data or process company transactions on a yearly basis.  We review these reports to detect any potential cybersecurity issues. However, these safeguards do not ensure that a significant system/data breach could not occur.  Due to the pandemic, certain roles have been conducted remotely, increasing the role and importance of our information technology and security systems.  A successful attack on our information technology systems could significantly affect the business, including liability for compromised customer information and business interruption. Roto-Rooter’s success is highly dependent on its brand reputation Roto-Rooter’s national reputation and brand image for performing necessary, high quality services in a timely manner is critical to Roto-Rooter’s continued success.  Adverse publicity, litigation or on-line negative reviews focused on the Roto-Rooter brand could negatively impact Roto-Rooter’s national reputation resulting in decreased future demand for Roto-Rooter branded services.  Roto-Rooter maintains a reputation management risk program, however, a loss of brand reputation at Roto-Rooter could adversely affect consumer willingness to use our service and thus, adversely affect our future operating performance. VITAS  VITAS is highly dependent on payments from Medicare and Medicaid.  If there are changes in the rate or methods governing these payments, VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profits could materially decline. In excess of 90% of VITAS’ net patient service revenue consists of payments from the Medicare and Medicaid programs.  Such payments are made primarily on a “per diem” basis, subject to annual reimbursement caps.  Because VITAS receives a per diem fee to provide eligible services to all patients, VITAS’ profitability is largely dependent upon its ability to manage the costs of providing hospice services to patients.  Increases in operating costs, such as labor and supply costs that are subject to inflation, without a compensating increase in Medicare and Medicaid rates, could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business in the future.  Additionally, regulators are increasing scrutiny of claims, including through the new TPE program, which may require additional resources to respond to audits, and which may cause additional delays or denials in receiving payments.  Medicare and Medicaid currently adjust the various hospice payment rates annually based primarily on the increase or decrease of the hospital wage index basket, regionally adjusted.  However, the increases may be less than actual inflation.  VITAS’ profitability could be negatively impacted if this adjustment were eliminated or reduced, or if VITAS’ costs of providing hospice services increased more than the annual adjustment.  In addition, cost pressures resulting from shorter patient lengths of stay and the use of more expensive forms of palliative care, including drugs and drug delivery systems, could negatively impact VITAS’ profitability.  Many payors are increasing pressure to control health care costs.  The U.S. federal budget remains in flux, which could, among other things, cut Medicare payments to providers.  The Medicare program is frequently mentioned as a target for spending cuts and within the Medicare program the hospice benefit is often specifically targeted for cuts and a lowering of the Medicare Caps.  The full impact on our business of any future cuts in Medicare (including lowering of the Medicare Caps) or other programs is uncertain.  In addition, both public and private payors are increasing pressure to decrease, or limit increases in, reimbursement rates for health care services.  VITAS’ levels of revenue and profitability will be subject to the effect of possible reductions in coverage or payment rates by third-party payors, including payment rates from Medicare and Medicaid. Each state that maintains a Medicaid program has the option to provide reimbursement for hospice services at reimbursement rates generally required to be at least as much as Medicare rates.  All states in which VITAS operates cover Medicaid hospice services; however, we cannot assure you that the states in which VITAS is presently operating or states into which VITAS could expand operations  15will continue to cover Medicaid hospice services.  In addition, the Medicare and Medicaid programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive and prospective rate and payment adjustments, administrative rulings, freezes and funding reductions, all of which may adversely affect the level of program payments and could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business.  We cannot assure that Medicare and/or Medicaid payments to hospices will not decrease.  Reductions in amounts paid by government programs for services or changes in methods or regulations governing payments could cause VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profits to materially decline. 16% to 20% of VITAS’ days of care are provided to patients who reside in nursing homes. Changes in the laws and regulations regarding payments for hospice services and “room and board” provided to VITAS’ hospice patients residing in nursing homes could reduce its net patient service revenue and profitability. For VITAS’ hospice patients receiving nursing home care under certain state Medicaid programs who elect hospice care under Medicare and Medicaid, the state generally must pay VITAS, in addition to the applicable Medicare or Medicaid hospice per diem rate, an amount equal to at least 95% of the Medicaid per diem nursing home rate for “room and board” furnished to the patient by the nursing home.  VITAS contracts with various nursing homes for the nursing homes’ provision of certain “room and board” services that the nursing homes would otherwise provide Medicaid nursing home patients.  VITAS bills and collects from the applicable state Medicaid program an amount equal to approximately 95% of the amount that would otherwise have been paid directly to the nursing home under the state’s Medicaid plan.  Under VITAS’ standard nursing home contracts, it pays the nursing home for these “room and board” services at approximately 100% of the Medicaid per diem nursing home rate. The reduction or elimination of Medicare and Medicaid payments for hospice patients residing in nursing homes would reduce VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profitability.  In addition, changes in the way nursing homes are reimbursed for “room and board” services provided to hospice patients residing in nursing homes could affect VITAS’ ability to serve patients in nursing homes.  If VITAS is unable to maintain relationships with existing patient referral sources or to establish new referral sources, VITAS’ growth and profitability could be adversely affected.  VITAS’ success is heavily dependent on referrals from physicians, long-term care facilities, hospitals and other institutional health care providers, managed care companies, insurance companies and other patient referral sources in the communities that its hospice locations serve, as well as on its ability to maintain good relations with these referral sources.  VITAS’ referral sources may refer their patients to other hospice care providers or not to a hospice provider at all.  Additionally, because of the pandemic, VITAS has experienced significant changes in referral patterns and sources.  VITAS’ growth and profitability depend significantly on its ability to establish and maintain close working relationships with these patient referral sources and to increase awareness and acceptance of hospice care by its referral sources and their patients.  We cannot assure that VITAS will be able to maintain its existing relationships or that it will be able to develop and maintain new relationships in existing or new markets.  Moreover, if pandemic-related shifts to referrals continue, it could materially adversely affect the business.  VITAS’ loss of existing relationships or its failure to develop new relationships could adversely affect its ability to expand or maintain its operations and operate profitably.  Moreover, we cannot assure you that awareness or acceptance of hospice care will increase or remain at current levels.  VITAS operates in an industry that is subject to extensive government regulation and claims reviews, and changes in law and regulatory interpretations could reduce its net patient service revenue and profitability and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. The healthcare industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations relating to, among others: Payment for services; Conduct of operations, including fraud and abuse, anti-kickback prohibitions, self-referral prohibitions and false claims; Privacy and security of medical records; Employment practices; and Various state approval requirements, such as facility and professional licensure, certificate of need, compliance surveys and other certification or recertification requirements.  Changes in these laws, rules and regulations or their interpretations or methods of enforcement could reduce VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profitability.  VITAS’ ability to comply with such regulations is a key factor in determining the success of its business.  See the “Government Regulations” section of this 10-K for a greater description of these matters.  16  Fraud and Abuse Laws.  VITAS contracts with a significant number of health care providers and practitioners, including physicians, hospitals and nursing homes and arranges for these entities to provide services to VITAS’ patients.  Some of these health care providers and practitioners may refer, or be in a position to refer, patients to VITAS (or VITAS may refer patients to them).  These arrangements may not qualify for a safe harbor.  VITAS from time to time seeks guidance from regulatory counsel as to the changing and evolving interpretations and the potential applicability of the Anti-Kickback Law to its programs, and in response thereto, takes such actions as it deems appropriate.  VITAS generally believes that its contracts and arrangements with providers, practitioners and suppliers should not be found to violate the Anti-Kickback Law.  However, we cannot assure you that such laws will ultimately be interpreted in a manner consistent with VITAS’ practices. Several health care reform proposals have included an expansion of the Anti-Kickback Law to include referrals of any patients regardless of payor source, which is similar to the scope of certain laws that have been enacted at the state level.  In addition, a number of states in which VITAS operates have laws, which vary from state to state, prohibiting certain direct or indirect remuneration or fee-splitting arrangements between health care providers, regardless of payor source, for the referral of patients to a particular provider. The federal Ethics in Patient Referral Act, Section 1877 of the Social Security Act (commonly known as the “Stark Law”) prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients for “designated health services” to entities in which they hold an ownership or investment interest or with whom they have a compensation arrangement, subject to certain statutory or regulatory exceptions.  We cannot assure you that future statutory or regulatory changes will not result in hospice services being subject to the Stark Law’s ownership, investment, compensation or referral prohibitions.  Several states in which VITAS operates have similar laws which likewise are subject to change.  Any such changes could adversely affect the business, financial condition and operating results of VITAS. Further, under separate statutes, submission of claims for items or services that are “not provided as claimed” may lead to civil money penalties, criminal fines and imprisonment and/or exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federally funded state health care programs.  These false claims statutes include the federal False Claims Act, which allows any person to bring suit on behalf of the federal government, known as a qui tam action, alleging false or fraudulent Medicare or Medicaid claims or other violations of the statute and to share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement.   Certificate of Need Laws.  Many states, including Florida, have certificate of need laws or other similar health planning laws that apply to hospice care providers.  These states may require some form of state agency review or approval prior to opening a new hospice program, to adding or expanding hospice services, to undertaking significant capital expenditures or under other specified circumstances.  Approval under these certificate of need laws is generally conditioned on the showing of a demonstrable need for services in the community.  VITAS may seek to develop, acquire or expand hospice programs in states having certificate of need laws.  To the extent that state agencies require VITAS to obtain a certificate of need or other similar approvals to expand services at existing hospice programs or to make acquisitions or develop hospice programs in new or existing geographical markets, VITAS’ plans could be adversely affected by a failure to obtain a certificate or approval.  In addition, competitors may seek administratively or judicially to challenge such an approval or proposed approval by the state agency.  Such a challenge, whether or not ultimately successful, as well as a state significantly changing its existing certificate of need rules and regulations, could adversely affect VITAS. Other Federal and State Regulations.  The federal government and all states regulate various aspects of the hospice industry and VITAS’ business.  In particular, VITAS’ operations are subject to federal and state health regulatory laws, including those covering professional services, the dispensing of drugs and certain types of hospice activities.  Certain of VITAS’ employees are subject to state laws and regulations governing professional practice.  VITAS’ operations are subject to periodic survey by governmental authorities and private accrediting entities to assure compliance with applicable state licensing, and Medicare and Medicaid certification and accreditation standards, as the case may be.  From time to time in the ordinary course of business, VITAS receives survey reports noting deficiencies for alleged failure to comply with applicable requirements.  VITAS reviews such reports and takes appropriate corrective action.  The failure to effect such action could result in one of VITAS’ hospice programs being terminated from the Medicare hospice program.  Any termination of one or more of VITAS’ hospice locations from the Medicare hospice program could adversely affect VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profitability and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.   The failure to obtain, renew or maintain any of the required regulatory approvals, certifications or licenses could materially adversely affect VITAS’ business and could prevent the programs involved from offering products and services to patients.  In addition, laws and regulations often are adopted to regulate new products, services and industries.  We cannot assure you that either the states or the federal government will not impose additional regulations on VITAS’ activities, which might materially adversely affect VITAS, including impairing the value of its brand. Claims Review.  The Medicare and Medicaid programs and their Medicare Administrative Contractors and other payors periodically conduct pre-payment or post-payment reviews and other reviews and audits of health care claims, including hospice claims.  As a result of such reviews or audits, payments to VITAS could be delayed, suspended, or VITAS could be required to return any amounts found to be overpaid, or amounts found to be overpaid could be recouped through reductions in future payments.  There is  17pressure from state and federal governments and other payors to scrutinize health care claims to determine their validity and appropriateness including the new TPE program.  VITAS’ claims are periodically subject to review and audit.  We cannot assure you that reviews and/or similar audits of VITAS’ claims will not result in material recoupments, delays, suspensions, denials or other actions that could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business, financial condition and results of operations.   Regulation and Provision of Continuous Home Care.  VITAS provides continuous home care to patients requiring such care.  Continuous home care is provided to allow the patient to remain in their home, during periods of crisis when intensive monitoring and care, primarily nursing care, is required in order to achieve palliation or management of acute medical symptoms.  Continuous home care requires a minimum of 8 hours of care within a 24 hour day, which begins and ends at midnight.  The care must be predominantly nursing care provided by either a registered nurse or licensed practical nurse. Continuous home care can be challenging for a hospice to provide for a number of reasons, including the need to have available sufficient skilled and trained staff to furnish such care, the need to manage the staffing and provision of such care, and a shortage of nurses that can make it particularly difficult to attract and retain nurses that are required to furnish a majority of such care.  Medicare reimbursement for continuous home care has been calculated by multiplying the applicable continuous home care hourly rate by the number of hours of care provided.  If the care was provided for less than 1 hour, Medicare requires reporting in 15 minute increments of care provided, with no rounding. Medicare reimbursement for continuous home care is subject to a number of requirements posing further challenges for a hospice providing such care.  For example, if a patient requires skilled interventions for palliation or symptom management that can be accomplished in less than 8 aggregate hours within the 24 hour period, if the majority of care can be accomplished by someone other than a registered nurse or a licensed practical nurse (e.g., if a majority of care is furnished by a home health aide or homemaker), or if for any reason less than 8 hours of direct care are provided (such as when a patient dies before 8 AM even if 7 or more hours of care has been provided), the care rendered cannot be reimbursed by Medicare at the continuous home care rate (although the care instead may be eligible for Medicare reimbursement at the reduced routine home care day rate).  As a result of such requirements, VITAS may incur the costs of providing services intended to be continuous home care services yet be unable to bill or be reimbursed for such services at the continuous home care rate.  We cannot assure you that challenges in providing continuous home care will not cause VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profits to materially decline or that reviews and/or similar audits of VITAS’ claims will not result in material recoupments, denials or other actions that could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business, financial condition and results of operations. Compliance.  VITAS maintains an internal regulatory compliance review program and from time to time retains regulatory counsel for guidance on compliance matters.  We cannot assure you, however, that VITAS’ practices, if reviewed, would be found to be in compliance with applicable health regulatory laws, as such laws ultimately may be interpreted, or that any non-compliance with such laws would not have a material adverse effect on VITAS. Federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives could require VITAS to expend substantial sums on acquiring, implementing and supporting new information systems, which could negatively impact its profitability. There are currently numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives at both the state and federal levels that address patient privacy concerns.  We cannot predict the total financial or other impact of the regulations on VITAS’ operations.  In addition, although VITAS’ management believes it is in compliance with the requirement of patient privacy regulations, we cannot assure you that VITAS will not be found to have violated state and federal laws, rules or guidelines surrounding patient privacy.  Compliance with current and future HIPAA and HITECH requirements or any other federal or state privacy initiatives could require VITAS to make substantial investments, which could negatively impact its profitability and cash flows. VITAS’ growth strategies may not be successful, which could adversely affect its business. A significant element of VITAS’ growth strategy is expected to include expansion of its business in new and existing markets.  This aspect of VITAS’ growth strategy may not be successful, which could adversely impact its growth and profitability.  We cannot assure you that VITAS will be able to: Identify markets that meet its selection criteria for new hospice locations; Hire and retain qualified management teams to operate each of its new hospice locations; Manage a large and geographically diverse group of hospice locations; Become Medicare and Medicaid certified in new markets;  18  Generate sufficient hospice admissions to operate profitably in these new markets; Compete effectively with existing hospices in new markets; or Obtain state licensure and/or a certificate of need from appropriate state agencies in new markets. VITAS’ loss of key management personnel or its inability to hire and retain skilled employees could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. VITAS’ future success significantly depends upon the continued service of its senior management personnel.  The loss of one or more of VITAS’ key senior management personnel or its inability to hire and retain new skilled employees could negatively impact VITAS’ ability to maintain or increase patient referrals, a key aspect of its growth strategy, and could adversely affect its future operating results.  Competition for skilled employees is intense, and the process of locating and recruiting skilled employees with the combination of qualifications and attributes required to care effectively for terminally ill patients and their families can be difficult and lengthy.  We cannot assure you that VITAS will be successful in attracting, retaining or training highly skilled nursing, management, community education, operations, admissions and other personnel.  VITAS’ business could be disrupted and its growth and profitability negatively impacted if it is unable to attract and retain skilled employees. A nationwide shortage of qualified nurses could adversely affect VITAS’ profitability, growth and ability to continue to provide quality, responsive hospice services to its patients as nursing wages and benefits increase.  A significant portion of VITAS’ workforce is licensed nurses.  VITAS depends on qualified nurses to provide quality, responsive hospice services to its patients.  The current nationwide shortage of qualified nurses impacts some of the markets in which VITAS provides hospice services.  In response to this shortage, VITAS has adjusted its wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and to engage contract nurses.  VITAS’ inability to attract and retain qualified nurses could adversely affect its ability to provide quality, responsive hospice services to its patients and its ability to increase or maintain patient census in those markets.  Increases in the wages and benefits required to attract and retain qualified nurses or an increase in reliance on contract nurses could negatively impact profitability. VITAS may not be able to compete successfully against other hospice providers, and competitive pressures may limit its ability to maintain or increase its market position and adversely affect its profitability, financial condition and results of operations. Hospice care in the United States is highly competitive.  In many areas in which VITAS’ hospices are located, they compete with a large number of organizations, including: Community-based hospice providers; National and regional companies; Hospital-based hospice and palliative care programs; Physician groups; Nursing homes; Home health agencies; Infusion therapy companies; and Nursing agencies. Various health care companies have diversified into the hospice industry and there is an increasing consolidation across hospice industry.  Other companies, including hospitals and health care organizations that are not currently providing hospice care, may enter the markets VITAS serves and expand the variety of services offered to include hospice care.  We cannot assure you that VITAS will not encounter increased competition in the future that could limit its ability to maintain or increase its market position, including competition from parties in a position to impact referrals to VITAS.  Such increased competition could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business, financial condition and results of operations. 19  If VITAS fails to comply with the terms of the CIA, it could be subject to substantial monetary penalties or suspension or exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.   VITAS and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a CIA with the Office of the OIG on October 30, 2017 in connection with the settlement of a False Claims Act case.  The CIA formalizes various aspects of VITAS’ already existing compliance program and contains requirements designed to document compliance with federal healthcare program requirements. It has a term of five years during which it imposes monitoring, reporting, certification, oversight, screening and training obligations, certain of which had previously been implemented by VITAS.  It also required VITAS to engage an Independent Review Organization to perform auditing and review functions and to prepare reports regarding compliance with federal healthcare programs.  In the event of breach of the CIA, VITAS could become liable for payment of stipulated penalties or could be excluded from participation in federal healthcare programs.  Changes in rates or methods of payment for VITAS’ services could adversely affect its revenues and profits.  Managed care organizations have grown substantially in terms of the percentage of the population they cover and their control over an increasing portion of the health care economy.  Managed care organizations have continued to consolidate to enhance their ability to influence the delivery of health care services and to exert pressure to control health care costs.  VITAS has a number of contractual arrangements with managed care organizations and other similar parties. VITAS provides hospice care to many Medicare beneficiaries who have elected Medicare managed care.  Under such contracts between HMOs and the federal Department of Health and Human Services, the Medicare payments for hospice services are excluded from the per-member, per-month payment from Medicare to HMOs and instead are paid directly by Medicare to the hospices.  As a result, VITAS’ payments for Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare risk HMOs are processed in the same way with the same rates as other Medicare beneficiaries.  We cannot assure, however, that payment for hospice services will continue to be excluded from HMO payment under Medicare risk contracts and similar Medicare managed care plans or that if not excluded, managed care organizations or other large third-party payors would not use their power to influence and exert pressure on health care providers to reduce costs in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business, financial condition and results of operations.  Liability claims may have an adverse effect on VITAS, and its insurance coverage may be inadequate. Participants in the hospice industry are subject to lawsuits alleging negligence, professional liability, wage and hour or other similar legal theories, many of which involve large claims and significant defense costs.  Additionally, the pandemic may lead to different claims or a higher volume of claims than we typically face.  We are also subject to the risk of lawsuits under the False Claims Act and comparable state laws for allegedly submitting fraudulent bills for services to the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other federal and state healthcare programs.  These lawsuits, which may be initiated by “whistleblowers”, subpoenas or Civil Investigative Demands can involve significant monetary damages, fines, attorneys’ fees and the award of bounties to private qui tam plaintiffs. From time to time, VITAS is subject to such claims and other types of lawsuits.  See the description below under Legal Proceedings in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.  The ultimate liability for claims, if any, could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or operating results.  Although VITAS currently maintains liability insurance intended to cover certain claims, we cannot assure you that the coverage limits of such insurance policies will be adequate or that all such claims will be covered by the insurance.  In addition, VITAS’ insurance policies must be renewed annually and may be subject to cancellation during the policy period.  While VITAS has been able to obtain liability insurance in the past, such insurance varies in cost, and may not be available in the future on terms acceptable to VITAS, if at all. A successful claim in excess of the insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on VITAS.  Claims, regardless of their merit or eventual outcome, also may have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business and reputation due to the costs of litigation, diversion of management’s time and related publicity. VITAS procures professional liability coverage on a claims-made basis.  The insurance contracts specify that coverage is available only during the term of each insurance contract.  VITAS’ management intends to renew or replace the existing claims-made policy annually but such coverage is difficult to obtain, may be subject to cancellation and may be written by carriers that are unable, or unwilling to pay claims. Additionally, some risks and liabilities, including claims for punitive damages, are not covered by insurance.  Cybersecurity  In the normal course of business, our information technology systems hold sensitive patient information including patient demographic data, eligibility for various medical plans including Medicare and Medicaid and protected health information.  Additionally, we utilize those same systems to perform our day-to-day activities, such as receiving referrals, assigning medical teams to patients, documenting medical information and maintaining an accurate record of all transactions.  Recently healthcare organizations have been the focus of increased cybersecurity attacks.  We have not experienced any known attacks on our information technology  20systems that have compromised patient data or the Company’s proprietary data.  We maintain our information technology systems with safeguard protection against cyber-attacks including active intrusion protection, firewalls and virus detection software.  As discussed previously, we are subject to and comply with HIPAA and HITECH regulations.  We have developed and tested a response plan in the event of a successful attack and we maintain commercial insurance related to a cyber-attack. Additionally, we obtain internal control reports from key vendors that maintain company data or process company transactions on a yearly basis.  We review these reports to detect any potential cybersecurity issues.  However, these safeguards do not ensure that a significant cyber-attack could not occur.  Increases in working from home and the provision of telehealth services due to the pandemic have significantly increased our usage of information technology systems and heightened the need for security of those systems.  A successful attack on our information technology systems could have significant consequences to the business including liability for compromised patient information and business interruption. We are regularly the target of attempted cyber and other security threats and must continuously monitor and develop our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent, detect, address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact.  Insider or employee cyber and security threats are increasingly a concern for all large companies, including ours. VITAS’ success is highly dependent on its brand reputation VITAS’ reputation for performing quality routine and high acuity patient hospice care within the regulations mandated by Medicare, Medicaid and commercial payors is critical to our success.  Failure to provide quality patient care within the regulations mandated by our third-party payors, or the perception of inappropriate care resulting in adverse publicity, litigation or a campaign of negative on-line reviews are some of the factors that could negatively impact VITAS’ national reputation.  VITAS maintains a reputation management risk program however, a loss of brand reputation at VITAS could adversely affect referral sources’ willingness to refer our service and thus, adversely affect our future operating performance. VITAS’ headquarters and a significant portion of its operations are in south Florida The occurrence of a natural disaster in any region that VITAS has significant operations could have a negative impact on the business.  VITAS’ headquarters are located in Miami, Florida.  In addition, two of our largest programs and an office complex are in south Florida.  The location of our headquarters and these large programs increases our exposure to hurricanes.  A major hurricane in south Florida could impede our ability to bill for our services, operate our businesses and serve our patients in the affected area.  VITAS maintains a disaster recovery program to mitigate this risk; however, natural disasters could have an adverse effect on our future operating performance"
9,CHE,CHEMED CORP,2020-02-26,"Risk Factors
 You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in evaluating us and our Capital Stock.  They are not the only ones facing the Company.  Other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. GENERAL We have incurred debt to finance the operations of the Company.   The Company has debt service obligations that may restrict our operating flexibility.  We cannot assure you that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to service our debt, which may require us to borrow additional funds, or restructure or otherwise refinance our debt.  In addition, the Company has the ability to expand its debt and borrowing capacity subject to various restrictions  11 and covenants defined by its creditors.  The interest rate the Company pays will fluctuate from time to time based upon a number of factors including current LIBOR rates and Company operating performance.  Significant changes in these factors could result in a material change in the Company’s interest expense. Our ability to repay or to refinance our indebtedness and to pay interest on our indebtedness will depend on our operating performance, which may be affected by factors beyond our control.  These factors could include operating difficulties, increased operating costs, our competitors’ actions and regulatory developments.  Our ability to meet our debt service and other obligations may depend in significant part on the extent to which we successfully implement our business strategy.  We cannot assure you that we will be able to implement our strategy fully or that the anticipated results of our strategy will be realized.  Credit market conditions may make it difficult for us to obtain new financing or refinance our current debt on terms and conditions acceptable to us. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional equity capital or restructure our debt.  We cannot assure you that our cash flows and capital resources will be sufficient to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness in the future or that alternative measures would successfully meet our debt service obligations. The agreements and instruments governing our outstanding debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business and adversely affect the price of our Capital Stock. The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our instruments of indebtedness restrict our ability to incur additional debt; issue and sell capital stock of subsidiaries; sell assets; engage in transactions with affiliates; restrict distributions from subsidiaries; incur liens; engage in business other than permitted businesses; engage in sale/leaseback transactions; engage in mergers or consolidations; make capital expenditures; make guarantees; make investments and acquisitions; enter into operating leases; hedge interest rates; and prepay other debt. Moreover, if we are unable to meet the terms of the financial covenants or if we breach any of these covenants, a default could result under one or more of these agreements.  A default, if not waived by our lenders, could accelerate repayment of our outstanding indebtedness.  If acceleration occurs, we may not be able to repay our debt and it is unlikely that we would be able to borrow sufficient additional funds to refinance such debt on acceptable terms.  In the event of any default under our credit facilities, the lenders thereunder could elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, to be due and payable, and to require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings, any of which would be an event of default. We depend on our management team and the loss of their service could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of our executive management team.  The loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract or retain other skilled personnel in the future.  Environmental and safety compliance costs and liabilities could increase our expenses and adversely affect our financial condition. Our operations are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that prohibit or restrict the discharge of pollutants into the environment and regulate employee exposure to hazardous substance in the workplace.  Failure to comply with these laws could subject us to material costs and liabilities, including civil and criminal fines, costs to cleanup contamination we cause and, in some circumstances, costs to cleanup contamination we discover on our own property but did not cause. Because we use and generate hazardous materials in some of our operations, we are potentially subject to material liabilities relating to the cleanup of contamination and personal injury claims.  In addition, we have retained certain environmental liabilities in connection with the sale of former businesses.  We are currently funding the cleanup of historical contamination at one of our former properties and contributing to the cleanup of third-party sites as a result of our sale of our former subsidiary DuBois Chemicals Inc.  Although we have established a reserve for these liabilities, actual cleanup costs may exceed our current estimates due to factors beyond our control, such as the discovery of additional contamination or the enforcement of more stringent cleanup requirements.  New laws and regulations or their stricter enforcement, the discovery of presently unknown conditions or the receipt of additional claims for indemnification could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities including impairment of our brand that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  12  We are subject to certain anti-takeover statutes that might make it more difficult to effect a change in control of the Company. We are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits us from engaging in a “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.  The application of Section 203 could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control that could be advantageous to stockholders. An adverse ruling against us in certain litigation could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We are involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of our business currently and from time to time.  The damages claimed against us in some of these cases can be substantial.  See the “Legal Proceedings” sections of this 10-K for discussion of particular matters. We cannot assure you that we will prevail in pending cases.  Regardless of the outcome, such litigation is costly to manage, investigate and defend, and the related defense costs, diversion of management’s time and related publicity may adversely affect the conduct of our business and the results of our operations. ROTO-ROOTER We face intense competition from numerous, fragmented competitors.  If we do not compete effectively, our business may suffer. We face intense competition from numerous competitors.  The sewer, drain and pipe cleaning, excavation, plumbing repair and water restoration businesses are highly fragmented, with the bulk of the industries consisting of local and regional competitors.  We compete primarily on the basis of advertising, range of services provided, name recognition, availability of emergency service, speed and quality of customer service, service guarantees and pricing.  Our competitors may succeed in developing new or enhanced products and services more successful than ours and in marketing and selling existing and new products and services better than we do.  In addition, new competitors may emerge.  We cannot make any assurances that we will continue to be able to compete successfully with any of these companies.   Our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations, exposing us to potential claims and compliance costs that could adversely affect our business. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to franchising, insurance and other aspects of our business.  These are discussed in greater detail under “Government Regulations” in the Description of Business section hereof.  If we fail to comply with existing or future laws and regulations, we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines and sanctions.  Our franchising activities are subject to various federal and state franchising laws and regulations, including the rules and regulations of the FTC regarding the offering or sale of franchises.  These rules and regulations require us to provide all of our prospective franchisees with specific information regarding us and our franchise program in the form of a detailed franchise offering circular.  In addition, a number of states require us to register our franchise offering prior to offering or selling franchises in such states.  Various state laws also provide for certain rights in favor of franchisees, including (i) limitations on the franchisor’s ability to terminate a franchise except for good cause, (ii) restrictions on the franchisor’s ability to deny renewal of a franchise, (iii) circumstances under which the franchisor may be required to purchase certain inventory of franchisees when a franchise is terminated or not renewed in violation of such laws and (iv) provisions relating to arbitration.  The ability to engage in the plumbing repair business is also subject to certain limitations and restrictions imposed by the state and local licensing laws and regulations.   We cannot predict what legislation or regulations affecting our business will be enacted in the future, how existing or future laws or regulations will be enforced, administered and interpreted, or the amount of future expenditures that may be required to comply with these laws or regulations.  Compliance costs associated with governmental regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Roto-Rooter’s loss of key management personnel or its inability to hire and retain skilled employees could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. Roto-Rooter’s future success significantly depends upon the continued service of its senior management personnel.  The loss of one or more of Roto-Rooter’s key senior management personnel or its inability to hire and retain new skilled employees could negatively impact its ability to maintain or increase customer calls and jobs, a key aspect of its growth strategy, and could adversely affect its future operating results. Competition for skilled employees, particularly licensed plumbers, is intense, and the process of locating and recruiting skilled employees with the combination of qualifications and attributes required to adequately perform plumbing duties can be difficult and lengthy.  We cannot assure you that Roto-Rooter will be successful in attracting, retaining or training highly skilled personnel.  Roto- 13 Rooter’s business could be disrupted and its growth and profitability negatively impacted if it is unable to attract and retain skilled employees.   Cybersecurity In the normal course of business, our information technology systems hold sensitive customer information including names, addresses and partial credit card information.  Additionally, we utilize those same systems to perform our day-to-day activities, such as receiving customer calls, dispatching technicians to jobs and maintaining an accurate record of all transactions.  We have not experienced any known system/data breaches on our information technology systems that compromised customer data or the company’s proprietary data.  We maintain our information technology systems with safeguard protection against cyber-attacks including intrusion detection and protection services, firewalls and virus detection software.  Additionally, on a quarterly basis, we test our information technology systems by using cyber-scanning software and other methods to learn how a successful system/data breach may occur. If a deficiency is detected, our IT staff will log and remediate the deficiency as prescribed by the vendor or manufacturer.  Roto-Rooter has developed and tested a response plan in the event of a successful system/data breach and maintains commercial insurance related to cyber-security.  However, these safeguards do not ensure that a significant system/data breach could not occur.  A successful attack on our information technology systems could have significant consequences to the business including liability for compromised customer information and business interruption. Roto-Rooter’s success is highly dependent on its brand reputation Roto-Rooter’s national reputation and brand image for performing necessary, high quality services in a timely manner is critical to Roto-Rooter’s continued success.  Adverse publicity, litigation or on-line negative reviews focused on the Roto-Rooter brand could negatively impact Roto-Rooter’s national reputation resulting in decreased future demand for Roto-Rooter branded services.  Roto-Rooter maintains a reputation management risk program, however, a loss of brand reputation at Roto-Rooter could adversely affect consumer willingness to use our service and thus, adversely affect our future operating performance. VITAS  VITAS is highly dependent on payments from Medicare and Medicaid.  If there are changes in the rate or methods governing these payments, VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profits could materially decline. In excess of 95% of VITAS’ net patient service revenue consists of payments from the Medicare and Medicaid programs.  Such payments are made primarily on a “per diem” basis, subject to annual reimbursement caps.  Because VITAS receives a per diem fee to provide eligible services to all patients, VITAS’ profitability is largely dependent upon its ability to manage the costs of providing hospice services to patients.  Increases in operating costs, such as labor and supply costs that are subject to inflation, without a compensating increase in Medicare and Medicaid rates, could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business in the future.  Additionally, regulators are increasing scrutiny of claims, including through the new TPE program, which may require additional resources to respond to audits, and which may cause additional delays or denials in receiving payments.  Medicare and Medicaid currently adjust the various hospice payment rates annually based primarily on the increase or decrease of the hospital wage index basket, regionally adjusted.  However, the increases may be less than actual inflation.  VITAS’ profitability could be negatively impacted if this adjustment were eliminated or reduced, or if VITAS’ costs of providing hospice services increased more than the annual adjustment.  In addition, cost pressures resulting from shorter patient lengths of stay and the use of more expensive forms of palliative care, including drugs and drug delivery systems, could negatively impact VITAS’ profitability.  Many payors are increasing pressure to control health care costs.  The U.S. federal budget remains in flux, which could, among other things, cut Medicare payments to providers.  The Medicare program is frequently mentioned as a target for spending cuts.  The full impact on our business of any future cuts in Medicare or other programs is uncertain.  In addition, both public and private payors are increasing pressure to decrease, or limit increases in, reimbursement rates for health care services.  VITAS’ levels of revenue and profitability will be subject to the effect of possible reductions in coverage or payment rates by third-party payors, including payment rates from Medicare and Medicaid. Each state that maintains a Medicaid program has the option to provide reimbursement for hospice services at reimbursement rates generally required to be at least as much as Medicare rates.  All states in which VITAS operates cover Medicaid hospice services; however, we cannot assure you that the states in which VITAS is presently operating or states into which VITAS could expand operations will continue to cover Medicaid hospice services.  In addition, the Medicare and Medicaid programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive and prospective rate and payment adjustments, administrative rulings, freezes and funding reductions, all of which may adversely affect the level of program payments and could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business.  We cannot assure that Medicare and/or Medicaid payments to hospices will not decrease.  Reductions in amounts paid by government programs for services or changes in methods or regulations governing payments could cause VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profits to materially decline.  14  Approximately 20% of VITAS’ days of care are provided to patients who reside in nursing homes. Changes in the laws and regulations regarding payments for hospice services and “room and board” provided to VITAS’ hospice patients residing in nursing homes could reduce its net patient service revenue and profitability. For VITAS’ hospice patients receiving nursing home care under certain state Medicaid programs who elect hospice care under Medicare and Medicaid, the state generally must pay VITAS, in addition to the applicable Medicare or Medicaid hospice per diem rate, an amount equal to at least 95% of the Medicaid per diem nursing home rate for “room and board” furnished to the patient by the nursing home.  VITAS contracts with various nursing homes for the nursing homes’ provision of certain “room and board” services that the nursing homes would otherwise provide Medicaid nursing home patients.  VITAS bills and collects from the applicable state Medicaid program an amount equal to approximately 95% of the amount that would otherwise have been paid directly to the nursing home under the state’s Medicaid plan.  Under VITAS’ standard nursing home contracts, it pays the nursing home for these “room and board” services at approximately 100% of the Medicaid per diem nursing home rate. The reduction or elimination of Medicare and Medicaid payments for hospice patients residing in nursing homes would reduce VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profitability.  In addition, changes in the way nursing homes are reimbursed for “room and board” services provided to hospice patients residing in nursing homes could affect VITAS’ ability to serve patients in nursing homes.  If VITAS is unable to maintain relationships with existing patient referral sources or to establish new referral sources, VITAS’ growth and profitability could be adversely affected.  VITAS’ success is heavily dependent on referrals from physicians, long-term care facilities, hospitals and other institutional health care providers, managed care companies, insurance companies and other patient referral sources in the communities that its hospice locations serve, as well as on its ability to maintain good relations with these referral sources.  VITAS’ referral sources may refer their patients to other hospice care providers or not to a hospice provider at all.  VITAS’ growth and profitability depend significantly on its ability to establish and maintain close working relationships with these patient referral sources and to increase awareness and acceptance of hospice care by its referral sources and their patients.  We cannot assure that VITAS will be able to maintain its existing relationships or that it will be able to develop and maintain new relationships in existing or new markets.  VITAS’ loss of existing relationships or its failure to develop new relationships could adversely affect its ability to expand or maintain its operations and operate profitably.  Moreover, we cannot assure you that awareness or acceptance of hospice care will increase or remain at current levels.  VITAS operates in an industry that is subject to extensive government regulation and claims reviews, and changes in law and regulatory interpretations could reduce its net patient service revenue and profitability and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. The healthcare industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations relating to, among others: Payment for services;Conduct of operations, including fraud and abuse, anti-kickback prohibitions, self-referral prohibitions and false claims;Privacy and security of medical records;Employment practices; andVarious state approval requirements, such as facility and professional licensure, certificate of need, compliance surveys and other certification or recertification requirements.  Changes in these laws, rules and regulations or their interpretations or methods of enforcement could reduce VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profitability.  VITAS’ ability to comply with such regulations is a key factor in determining the success of its business.  See the “Government Regulations” section of this 10-K for a greater description of these matters.  Fraud and Abuse Laws.  VITAS contracts with a significant number of health care providers and practitioners, including physicians, hospitals and nursing homes and arranges for these entities to provide services to VITAS’ patients.  Some of these health care providers and practitioners may refer, or be in a position to refer, patients to VITAS (or VITAS may refer patients to them).  These arrangements may not qualify for a safe harbor.  VITAS from time to time seeks guidance from regulatory counsel as to the changing and evolving interpretations and the potential applicability of the Anti-Kickback Law to its programs, and in response thereto, takes such actions as it deems appropriate.  VITAS generally believes that its contracts and arrangements with providers, practitioners and suppliers should not be found to violate the Anti-Kickback Law.  However, we cannot assure you that such laws will ultimately be interpreted in a manner consistent with VITAS’ practices.  15  Several health care reform proposals have included an expansion of the Anti-Kickback Law to include referrals of any patients regardless of payor source, which is similar to the scope of certain laws that have been enacted at the state level.  In addition, a number of states in which VITAS operates have laws, which vary from state to state, prohibiting certain direct or indirect remuneration or fee-splitting arrangements between health care providers, regardless of payor source, for the referral of patients to a particular provider. The federal Ethics in Patient Referral Act, Section 1877 of the Social Security Act (commonly known as the “Stark Law”) prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients for “designated health services” to entities in which they hold an ownership or investment interest or with whom they have a compensation arrangement, subject to certain statutory or regulatory exceptions.  We cannot assure you that future statutory or regulatory changes will not result in hospice services being subject to the Stark Law’s ownership, investment, compensation or referral prohibitions.  Several states in which VITAS operates have similar laws which likewise are subject to change.  Any such changes could adversely affect the business, financial condition and operating results of VITAS. Further, under separate statutes, submission of claims for items or services that are “not provided as claimed” may lead to civil money penalties, criminal fines and imprisonment and/or exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federally funded state health care programs.  These false claims statutes include the federal False Claims Act, which allows any person to bring suit on behalf of the federal government, known as a qui tam action, alleging false or fraudulent Medicare or Medicaid claims or other violations of the statute and to share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement.   Certificate of Need Laws.  Many states, including Florida, have certificate of need laws or other similar health planning laws that apply to hospice care providers.  These states may require some form of state agency review or approval prior to opening a new hospice program, to adding or expanding hospice services, to undertaking significant capital expenditures or under other specified circumstances.  Approval under these certificate of need laws is generally conditioned on the showing of a demonstrable need for services in the community.  VITAS may seek to develop, acquire or expand hospice programs in states having certificate of need laws.  To the extent that state agencies require VITAS to obtain a certificate of need or other similar approvals to expand services at existing hospice programs or to make acquisitions or develop hospice programs in new or existing geographical markets, VITAS’ plans could be adversely affected by a failure to obtain a certificate or approval.  In addition, competitors may seek administratively or judicially to challenge such an approval or proposed approval by the state agency.  Such a challenge, whether or not ultimately successful, as well as a state significantly changing its existing certificate of need rules and regulations, could adversely affect VITAS. Other Federal and State Regulations.  The federal government and all states regulate various aspects of the hospice industry and VITAS’ business.  In particular, VITAS’ operations are subject to federal and state health regulatory laws, including those covering professional services, the dispensing of drugs and certain types of hospice activities.  Certain of VITAS’ employees are subject to state laws and regulations governing professional practice.  VITAS’ operations are subject to periodic survey by governmental authorities and private accrediting entities to assure compliance with applicable state licensing, and Medicare and Medicaid certification and accreditation standards, as the case may be.  From time to time in the ordinary course of business, VITAS receives survey reports noting deficiencies for alleged failure to comply with applicable requirements.  VITAS reviews such reports and takes appropriate corrective action.  The failure to effect such action could result in one of VITAS’ hospice programs being terminated from the Medicare hospice program.  Any termination of one or more of VITAS’ hospice locations from the Medicare hospice program could adversely affect VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profitability and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.   The failure to obtain, renew or maintain any of the required regulatory approvals, certifications or licenses could materially adversely affect VITAS’ business and could prevent the programs involved from offering products and services to patients.  In addition, laws and regulations often are adopted to regulate new products, services and industries.  We cannot assure you that either the states or the federal government will not impose additional regulations on VITAS’ activities, which might materially adversely affect VITAS, including impairing the value of its brand. Claims Review.  The Medicare and Medicaid programs and their Medicare Administrative Contractors and other payors periodically conduct pre-payment or post-payment reviews and other reviews and audits of health care claims, including hospice claims.  As a result of such reviews or audits, payments to VITAS could be delayed, suspended, or VITAS could be required to return any amounts found to be overpaid, or amounts found to be overpaid could be recouped through reductions in future payments.  There is pressure from state and federal governments and other payors to scrutinize health care claims to determine their validity and appropriateness including the new TPE program.  VITAS’ claims are periodically subject to review and audit.  We cannot assure you that reviews and/or similar audits of VITAS’ claims will not result in material recoupments, delays, suspensions, denials or other actions that could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business, financial condition and results of operations.   Regulation and Provision of Continuous Home Care.  VITAS provides continuous home care to patients requiring such care.  Continuous home care is provided to allow the patient to remain in their home, during periods of crisis when intensive monitoring and care, primarily nursing care, is required in order to achieve palliation or management of acute medical symptoms.  Continuous home  16 care requires a minimum of 8 hours of care within a 24 hour day, which begins and ends at midnight.  The care must be predominantly nursing care provided by either a registered nurse or licensed practical nurse. Continuous home care can be challenging for a hospice to provide for a number of reasons, including the need to have available sufficient skilled and trained staff to furnish such care, the need to manage the staffing and provision of such care, and a shortage of nurses that can make it particularly difficult to attract and retain nurses that are required to furnish a majority of such care.  Medicare reimbursement for continuous home care has been calculated by multiplying the applicable continuous home care hourly rate by the number of hours of care provided.  If the care was provided for less than 1 hour, Medicare requires reporting in 15 minute increments of care provided, with no rounding. Medicare reimbursement for continuous home care is subject to a number of requirements posing further challenges for a hospice providing such care.  For example, if a patient requires skilled interventions for palliation or symptom management that can be accomplished in less than 8 aggregate hours within the 24 hour period, if the majority of care can be accomplished by someone other than a registered nurse or a licensed practical nurse (e.g., if a majority of care is furnished by a home health aide or homemaker), or if for any reason less than 8 hours of direct care are provided (such as when a patient dies before 8 AM even if 7 or more hours of care has been provided), the care rendered cannot be reimbursed by Medicare at the continuous home care rate (although the care instead may be eligible for Medicare reimbursement at the reduced routine home care day rate).  As a result of such requirements, VITAS may incur the costs of providing services intended to be continuous home care services yet be unable to bill or be reimbursed for such services at the continuous home care rate.  We cannot assure you that challenges in providing continuous home care will not cause VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profits to materially decline or that reviews and/or similar audits of VITAS’ claims will not result in material recoupments, denials or other actions that could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business, financial condition and results of operations. Compliance.  VITAS maintains an internal regulatory compliance review program and from time to time retains regulatory counsel for guidance on compliance matters.  We cannot assure you, however, that VITAS’ practices, if reviewed, would be found to be in compliance with applicable health regulatory laws, as such laws ultimately may be interpreted, or that any non-compliance with such laws would not have a material adverse effect on VITAS. Federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives could require VITAS to expend substantial sums on acquiring, implementing and supporting new information systems, which could negatively impact its profitability. There are currently numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives at both the state and federal levels that address patient privacy concerns.  We cannot predict the total financial or other impact of the regulations on VITAS’ operations.  In addition, although VITAS’ management believes it is in compliance with the requirement of patient privacy regulations, we cannot assure you that VITAS will not be found to have violated state and federal laws, rules or guidelines surrounding patient privacy.  Compliance with current and future HIPAA and HITECH requirements or any other federal or state privacy initiatives could require VITAS to make substantial investments, which could negatively impact its profitability and cash flows. VITAS’ growth strategies may not be successful, which could adversely affect its business. A significant element of VITAS’ growth strategy is expected to include expansion of its business in new and existing markets.  This aspect of VITAS’ growth strategy may not be successful, which could adversely impact its growth and profitability.  We cannot assure you that VITAS will be able to: Identify markets that meet its selection criteria for new hospice locations; Hire and retain qualified management teams to operate each of its new hospice locations; Manage a large and geographically diverse group of hospice locations; Become Medicare and Medicaid certified in new markets; Generate sufficient hospice admissions to operate profitably in these new markets; Compete effectively with existing hospices in new markets; or Obtain state licensure and/or a certificate of need from appropriate state agencies in new markets.  17  VITAS’ loss of key management personnel or its inability to hire and retain skilled employees could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. VITAS’ future success significantly depends upon the continued service of its senior management personnel.  The loss of one or more of VITAS’ key senior management personnel or its inability to hire and retain new skilled employees could negatively impact VITAS’ ability to maintain or increase patient referrals, a key aspect of its growth strategy, and could adversely affect its future operating results.  Competition for skilled employees is intense, and the process of locating and recruiting skilled employees with the combination of qualifications and attributes required to care effectively for terminally ill patients and their families can be difficult and lengthy.  We cannot assure you that VITAS will be successful in attracting, retaining or training highly skilled nursing, management, community education, operations, admissions and other personnel.  VITAS’ business could be disrupted and its growth and profitability negatively impacted if it is unable to attract and retain skilled employees. A nationwide shortage of qualified nurses could adversely affect VITAS’ profitability, growth and ability to continue to provide quality, responsive hospice services to its patients as nursing wages and benefits increase.  A significant portion of VITAS’ workforce is licensed nurses.  VITAS depends on qualified nurses to provide quality, responsive hospice services to its patients.  The current nationwide shortage of qualified nurses impacts some of the markets in which VITAS provides hospice services.  In response to this shortage, VITAS has adjusted its wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and to engage contract nurses.  VITAS’ inability to attract and retain qualified nurses could adversely affect its ability to provide quality, responsive hospice services to its patients and its ability to increase or maintain patient census in those markets.  Increases in the wages and benefits required to attract and retain qualified nurses or an increase in reliance on contract nurses could negatively impact profitability. VITAS may not be able to compete successfully against other hospice providers, and competitive pressures may limit its ability to maintain or increase its market position and adversely affect its profitability, financial condition and results of operations. Hospice care in the United States is highly competitive.  In many areas in which VITAS’ hospices are located, they compete with a large number of organizations, including: Community-based hospice providers; National and regional companies; Hospital-based hospice and palliative care programs; Physician groups; Nursing homes; Home health agencies; Infusion therapy companies; and Nursing agencies. Various health care companies have diversified into the hospice industry.  Other companies, including hospitals and health care organizations that are not currently providing hospice care, may enter the markets VITAS serves and expand the variety of services offered to include hospice care.  We cannot assure you that VITAS will not encounter increased competition in the future that could limit its ability to maintain or increase its market position, including competition from parties in a position to impact referrals to VITAS.  Such increased competition could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business, financial condition and results of operations. If VITAS fails to comply with the terms of the CIA, it could be subject to substantial monetary penalties or suspension or exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.   VITAS and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a CIA with the Office of the OIG on October 30, 2017 in connection with the settlement of a False Claims Act Case.  The CIA formalizes various aspects of VITAS’ already existing Compliance Program and contains requirements designed to document compliance with federal healthcare program requirements. It has a term of five years during  18 which it imposes monitoring, reporting, certification, oversight, screening and training obligations, certain of which had previously been implemented by VITAS.  It also required VITAS to engage an Independent Review Organization to perform auditing and review functions and to prepare reports regarding compliance with federal healthcare programs.  In the event of breach of the CIA, VITAS could become liable for payment of stipulated penalties or could be excluded from participation in federal healthcare programs.  Changes in rates or methods of payment for VITAS’ services could adversely affect its revenues and profits.  Managed care organizations have grown substantially in terms of the percentage of the population they cover and their control over an increasing portion of the health care economy.  Managed care organizations have continued to consolidate to enhance their ability to influence the delivery of health care services and to exert pressure to control health care costs.  VITAS has a number of contractual arrangements with managed care organizations and other similar parties. VITAS provides hospice care to many Medicare beneficiaries who have elected Medicare managed care.  Under such contracts between HMOs and the federal Department of Health and Human Services, the Medicare payments for hospice services are excluded from the per-member, per-month payment from Medicare to HMOs and instead are paid directly by Medicare to the hospices.  As a result, VITAS’ payments for Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare risk HMOs are processed in the same way with the same rates as other Medicare beneficiaries.  We cannot assure, however, that payment for hospice services will continue to be excluded from HMO payment under Medicare risk contracts and similar Medicare managed care plans or that if not excluded, managed care organizations or other large third-party payors would not use their power to influence and exert pressure on health care providers to reduce costs in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business, financial condition and results of operations.  Liability claims may have an adverse effect on VITAS, and its insurance coverage may be inadequate. Participants in the hospice industry are subject to lawsuits alleging negligence, professional liability, wage and hour or other similar legal theories, many of which involve large claims and significant defense costs.  We are also subject to the risk of lawsuits under the False Claims Act and comparable state laws for allegedly submitting fraudulent bills for services to the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other federal and state healthcare programs.  These lawsuits, which may be initiated by “whistleblowers” can involve significant monetary damages, fines, attorneys’ fees and the award of bounties to private qui tam plaintiffs. From time to time, VITAS is subject to such claims and other types of lawsuits.  See the description below under Legal Proceedings.  The ultimate liability for claims, if any, could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or operating results.  Although VITAS currently maintains liability insurance intended to cover certain claims, we cannot assure you that the coverage limits of such insurance policies will be adequate or that all such claims will be covered by the insurance.  In addition, VITAS’ insurance policies must be renewed annually and may be subject to cancellation during the policy period.  While VITAS has been able to obtain liability insurance in the past, such insurance varies in cost, and may not be available in the future on terms acceptable to VITAS, if at all. A successful claim in excess of the insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on VITAS.  Claims, regardless of their merit or eventual outcome, also may have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business and reputation due to the costs of litigation, diversion of management’s time and related publicity. VITAS procures professional liability coverage on a claims-made basis.  The insurance contracts specify that coverage is available only during the term of each insurance contract.  VITAS’ management intends to renew or replace the existing claims-made policy annually but such coverage is difficult to obtain, may be subject to cancellation and may be written by carriers that are unable, or unwilling to pay claims. Additionally, some risks and liabilities, including claims for punitive damages, are not covered by insurance.  Cybersecurity  In the normal course of business, our information technology systems hold sensitive patient information including patient demographic data, eligibility for various medical plans including Medicare and Medicaid and protected health information.  Additionally, we utilize those same systems to perform our day-to-day activities, such as receiving referrals, assigning medical teams to patients, documenting medical information and maintaining an accurate record of all transactions.  We have not experienced any known attacks on our information technology systems that have compromised patient data or the Company’s proprietary data.  We maintain our information technology systems with safeguard protection against cyber-attacks including active intrusion protection, firewalls and virus detection software.  As discussed previously, we are subject to and comply with HIPAA and HITECH regulations.  We have developed and tested a response plan in the event of a successful attack and we maintain commercial insurance related to a cyber-attack. However, these safeguards do not ensure that a significant cyber-attack could not occur.  A successful attack on our information technology systems could have significant consequences to the business including liability for compromised patient information and business interruption.  19  We are regularly the target of attempted cyber and other security threats and must continuously monitor and develop our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent, detect, address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact.  Insider or employee cyber and security threats are increasingly a concern for all large companies, including ours. VITAS’ success is highly dependent on its brand reputation VITAS’ reputation for performing quality routine and high acuity patient hospice care within the regulations mandated by Medicare, Medicaid and commercial payors is critical to our success.  Failure to provide quality patient care within the regulations mandated by our third-party payors, or the perception of inappropriate care resulting in adverse publicity, litigation or a campaign of negative on-line reviews are some of the factors that could negatively impact VITAS’ national reputation.  VITAS maintains a reputation management risk program however, a loss of brand reputation at VITAS could adversely affect referral sources’ willingness to refer our service and thus, adversely affect our future operating performance. VITAS’ headquarters and a significant portion of its operations are in south Florida The occurrence of a natural disaster in any region that VITAS has significant operations could have a negative impact on the business.  VITAS’ headquarters are located in Miami, Florida.  In addition, two of our largest programs and an office complex are in south Florida.  The location of our headquarters and these large programs increases our exposure to hurricanes.  A major hurricane in south Florida could impede our ability to bill for our services, operate our businesses and serve our patients in the affected area.  VITAS maintains a disaster recovery program to mitigate this risk; however, natural disasters could have an adverse effect on our future operating performance"
12,CHE,CHEMED CORP,2019-02-27,"  Risk Factors
You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the information included in this        Annual Report on Form 10-K, in evaluating us and our Capital Stock.  They are not the only ones facing the Company.  Other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect        our business, financial condition, or results of operations.GENERALWe have incurred debt to finance the operations of the Company.The Company has debt service obligations that may restrict our operating flexibility.  We cannot assure you that        our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to service our debt, which may require us to borrow additional funds, or restructure or otherwise refinance our debt.  In addition, the Company has the ability to expand its debt and borrowing        capacity subject to various restrictions and covenants defined by its creditors.  The interest rate the Company pays will fluctuate from time to time based upon a number of factors including current LIBOR rates and Company operating performance.         Significant changes in these factors could result in a material change in the Company’s interest expense.Our ability to repay or to refinance our indebtedness and to pay interest on our indebtedness will depend on our        operating performance, which may be affected by factors beyond our control.  These factors could include operating difficulties, increased operating costs, our competitors’ actions and regulatory developments.  Our ability to meet our debt service        and other obligations may depend in significant part on the extent to which we successfully implement our business strategy.  We cannot assure you that we will be able to implement our strategy fully or that the anticipated results of our strategy        will be realized.  Credit market conditions may make it difficult for us to obtain new financing or refinance our current debt on terms and conditions acceptable to us.If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to        reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional equity capital or restructure our debt.  We cannot assure you that our cash flows and capital resources will be sufficient to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on        our indebtedness in the future or that alternative measures would successfully meet our debt service obligations.The agreements and instruments governing our outstanding debt contain restrictions and limitations that could        significantly impact our ability to operate our business and adversely affect the price of our Capital Stock.The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our instruments of indebtedness restrict our ability to        incur additional debt; issue and sell capital stock of subsidiaries; sell assets; engage in transactions with affiliates; restrict distributions from subsidiaries; incur liens; engage in business other than permitted businesses; engage in        sale/leaseback transactions; engage in mergers or consolidations; make capital expenditures; make guarantees; make investments and acquisitions; enter into operating leases; hedge interest rates; and prepay other debt.Moreover, if we are unable to meet the terms of the financial covenants or if we breach any of these covenants, a        default could result under one or more of these agreements.  A default, if not waived by our lenders, could accelerate repayment of our outstanding indebtedness.  If acceleration occurs, we may not be able to repay our debt and it is unlikely that        we would be able to borrow sufficient additional funds to refinance such debt on acceptable terms.  In the event of any default under our credit facilities, the lenders thereunder could elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with        accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, to be due and payable, and to require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings, any of which would be an event of default.We depend on our management team and the loss of their service could have a material adverse effect on our        business, financial condition and results of operations.Our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of our executive management team.  The loss of        key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract or retain other skilled personnel in the future.12Environmental and safety compliance costs and liabilities could increase our expenses and adversely affect our        financial condition.Our operations are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that prohibit or        restrict the discharge of pollutants into the environment and regulate employee exposure to hazardous substance in the workplace.  Failure to comply with these laws could subject us to material costs and liabilities, including civil and criminal        fines, costs to cleanup contamination we cause and, in some circumstances, costs to cleanup contamination we discover on our own property but did not cause.Because we use and generate hazardous materials in some of our operations, we are potentially subject to material        liabilities relating to the cleanup of contamination and personal injury claims.  In addition, we have retained certain environmental liabilities in connection with the sale of former businesses.  We are currently funding the cleanup of historical        contamination at one of our former properties and contributing to the cleanup of third-party sites as a result of our sale of our former subsidiary DuBois Chemicals Inc.  Although we have established a reserve for these liabilities, actual cleanup        costs may exceed our current estimates due to factors beyond our control, such as the discovery of additional contamination or the enforcement of more stringent cleanup requirements.  New laws and regulations or their stricter enforcement, the        discovery of presently unknown conditions or the receipt of additional claims for indemnification could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities including impairment of our brand that could have a material        adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to certain anti-takeover statutes that might make it more difficult to effect a change in control        of the Company.We are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which        prohibits us from engaging in a “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved        in a prescribed manner.  The application of Section 203 could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control that could be advantageous to stockholders.An adverse ruling against us in certain litigation could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and        results of operations.We are involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of our business currently and from time to time.  The        damages claimed against us in some of these cases can be substantial.  See the “Legal Proceedings” sections of this 10-K for discussion of particular matters. We cannot assure you that we will prevail in pending cases.  Regardless of the outcome,        such litigation is costly to manage, investigate and defend, and the related defense costs, diversion of management’s time and related publicity may adversely affect the conduct of our business and the results of our operations.ROTO-ROOTERWe face intense competition from numerous, fragmented competitors.  If we do not compete effectively, our business        may suffer.We face intense competition from numerous competitors.  The sewer, drain and pipe cleaning, excavation, plumbing        repair and water restoration businesses are highly fragmented, with the bulk of the industries consisting of local and regional competitors.  We compete primarily on the basis of advertising, range of services provided, name recognition,        availability of emergency service, speed and quality of customer service, service guarantees and pricing.  Our competitors may succeed in developing new or enhanced products and services more successful than ours and in marketing and selling        existing and new products and services better than we do.  In addition, new competitors may emerge.  We cannot make any assurances that we will continue to be able to compete successfully with any of these companies.Our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations, exposing us to potential claims and compliance costs        that could adversely affect our business.We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to franchising, insurance and other        aspects of our business.  These are discussed in greater detail under “Government Regulations” in the Description of Business section hereof.  If we fail to comply with existing or future laws and regulations, we may be subject to governmental or        judicial fines and sanctions.  Our franchising activities are subject to various federal and state franchising laws and regulations, including the rules and regulations of the FTC regarding the offering or sale of franchises.  These rules and        regulations require us to provide all of our prospective franchisees with specific information regarding us and our franchise program in the form of a detailed franchise offering circular.  In addition, a number of states require us to register our        franchise offering prior to offering or selling franchises in such states.  Various state laws also provide for certain rights in favor of franchisees, including (i) limitations on the franchisor’s ability to terminate a franchise except for good        cause, (ii) restrictions on the franchisor’s ability to deny renewal of a franchise, (iii) circumstances under which the franchisor may be required to purchase certain inventory of franchisees when a franchise is terminated or not renewed in        violation of such laws and (iv) provisions relating to arbitration.  The ability to engage in the plumbing repair business is also subject to certain limitations and restrictions imposed by the state and local licensing laws and regulations.   We        cannot predict what legislation or regulations affecting our business will be enacted in the future, how existing or future laws or regulations will be enforced, administered and interpreted, or the amount of future expenditures that may be        required to comply with these laws or regulations.  Compliance costs associated with governmental regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.13Roto-Rooter’s loss of key management personnel or its inability to hire and retain skilled employees could        adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.Roto-Rooter’s future success significantly depends upon the continued service of its senior management personnel.         The loss of one or more of Roto-Rooter’s key senior management personnel or its inability to hire and retain new skilled employees could negatively impact its ability to maintain or increase customer calls and jobs, a key aspect of its growth        strategy, and could adversely affect its future operating results.Competition for skilled employees, particularly licensed plumbers, is intense, and the process of locating and        recruiting skilled employees with the combination of qualifications and attributes required to adequately perform plumbing duties can be difficult and lengthy.  We cannot assure you that Roto-Rooter will be successful in attracting, retaining or        training highly skilled personnel.  Roto-Rooter’s business could be disrupted and its growth and profitability negatively impacted if it is unable to attract and retain skilled employees.CybersecurityIn the normal course of business, our information technology systems hold sensitive customer information including        names, addresses and partial credit card information.  Additionally, we utilize those same systems to perform our day-to-day activities, such as receiving customer calls, dispatching technicians to jobs and maintaining an accurate record of all        transactions.  We have not experienced any known attacks on our information technology systems that compromised customer data or the Company’s proprietary data.  We maintain our information technology systems with safeguard protection against        cyber-attacks including intrusion detection and protection services, firewalls and virus detection software.  Additionally, on a quarterly basis, we test our information technology systems by using cyber-scanning software and other methods to learn        how a successful attack may be made.  We remedy any issues encountered during these tests.  We have developed and tested a response plan in the event of a successful attack and we maintain commercial insurance related to a cyber-attack.  However,        these safeguards do not ensure that a significant cyber-attack could not occur.  A successful attack on our information technology systems could have significant consequences to the business including liability for compromised customer information        and business interruption.We are regularly the target of attempted cyber and other security threats and must continuously monitor and        develop our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent, detect, address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact.  Insider or employee cyber and        security threats are increasingly a concern for all large companies, including ours.Roto-Rooter’s success is highly dependent on its brand reputationRoto-Rooter’s national reputation and brand image for performing necessary, high quality services in a timely        manner is critical to Roto-Rooter’s continued success.  Adverse publicity, litigation or on-line negative reviews focused on the Roto-Rooter brand could negatively impact Roto-Rooter’s national reputation resulting in decreased future demand for        Roto-Rooter branded services.  Roto-Rooter maintains a reputation management risk program, however, a loss of brand reputation at Roto-Rooter could adversely affect consumer willingness to use our service and thus, adversely affect our future        operating performance.14VITASVITAS is highly dependent on payments from Medicare and Medicaid.  If there are changes in the rate or methods        governing these payments, VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profits could materially decline.In excess of 95% of VITAS’ net patient service revenue consists of payments from the Medicare and Medicaid        programs.  Such payments are made primarily on a “per diem” basis, subject to annual reimbursement caps.  Because VITAS receives a per diem fee to provide eligible services to all patients, VITAS’ profitability is largely dependent upon its ability        to manage the costs of providing hospice services to patients.  Increases in operating costs, such as labor and supply costs that are subject to inflation, without a compensating increase in Medicare and Medicaid rates, could have a material        adverse effect on VITAS’ business in the future.  Medicare and Medicaid currently adjust the various hospice payment rates annually based primarily on the increase or decrease of the hospital wage index basket, regionally adjusted.  However, the        increases may be less than actual inflation.  VITAS’ profitability could be negatively impacted if this adjustment were eliminated or reduced, or if VITAS’ costs of providing hospice services increased more than the annual adjustment.  In addition,        cost pressures resulting from shorter patient lengths of stay and the use of more expensive forms of palliative care, including drugs and drug delivery systems, could negatively impact VITAS’ profitability.  Many payors are increasing pressure to        control health care costs.  The U.S. federal budget remains in flux, which could, among other things, cut Medicare payments to providers.  The Medicare program is frequently mentioned as a target for spending cuts.  The full impact on our business        of any future cuts in Medicare or other programs is uncertain.  In addition, both public and private payors are increasing pressure to decrease, or limit increases in, reimbursement rates for health care services.  VITAS’ levels of revenue and        profitability will be subject to the effect of possible reductions in coverage or payment rates by third-party payors, including payment rates from Medicare and Medicaid.Each state that maintains a Medicaid program has the option to provide reimbursement for hospice services at        reimbursement rates generally required to be at least as much as Medicare rates.  All states in which VITAS operates cover Medicaid hospice services; however, we cannot assure you that the states in which VITAS is presently operating or states into        which VITAS could expand operations will continue to cover Medicaid hospice services.  In addition, the Medicare and Medicaid programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive and prospective rate and payment adjustments,        administrative rulings, freezes and funding reductions, all of which may adversely affect the level of program payments and could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business.  We cannot assure that Medicare and/or Medicaid payments to        hospices will not decrease.  Reductions in amounts paid by government programs for services or changes in methods or regulations governing payments could cause VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profits to materially decline.Approximately 20% of VITAS’ days of care are provided to patients who reside in nursing homes. Changes in the laws        and regulations regarding payments for hospice services and “room and board” provided to VITAS’ hospice patients residing in nursing homes could reduce its net patient service revenue and profitability.For VITAS’ hospice patients receiving nursing home care under certain state Medicaid programs who elect hospice        care under Medicare and Medicaid, the state generally must pay VITAS, in addition to the applicable Medicare or Medicaid hospice per diem rate, an amount equal to at least 95% of the Medicaid per diem nursing home rate for “room and board”        furnished to the patient by the nursing home.  VITAS contracts with various nursing homes for the nursing homes’ provision of certain “room and board” services that the nursing homes would otherwise provide Medicaid nursing home patients.  VITAS        bills and collects from the applicable state Medicaid program an amount equal to approximately 95% of the amount that would otherwise have been paid directly to the nursing home under the state’s Medicaid plan.  Under VITAS’ standard nursing home        contracts, it pays the nursing home for these “room and board” services at approximately 100% of the Medicaid per diem nursing home rate.The reduction or elimination of Medicare and Medicaid payments for hospice patients residing in nursing homes        would reduce VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profitability.  In addition, changes in the way nursing homes are reimbursed for “room and board” services provided to hospice patients residing in nursing homes could affect VITAS’ ability to        serve patients in nursing homes.If VITAS is unable to maintain relationships with existing patient referral sources or to establish new referral        sources, VITAS’ growth and profitability could be adversely affected.VITAS’ success is heavily dependent on referrals from physicians, long-term care facilities, hospitals and other        institutional health care providers, managed care companies, insurance companies and other patient referral sources in the communities that its hospice locations serve, as well as on its ability to maintain good relations with these referral        sources.  VITAS’ referral sources may refer their patients to other hospice care providers or not to a hospice provider at all.  VITAS’ growth and profitability depend significantly on its ability to establish and maintain close working        relationships with these patient referral sources and to increase awareness and acceptance of hospice care by its referral sources and their patients.  We cannot assure that VITAS will be able to maintain its existing relationships or that it will        be able to develop and maintain new relationships in existing or new markets.  VITAS’ loss of existing relationships or its failure to develop new relationships could adversely affect its ability to expand or maintain its operations and operate        profitably.  Moreover, we cannot assure you that awareness or acceptance of hospice care will increase or remain at current levels.15VITAS operates in an industry that is subject to extensive government regulation and claims reviews, and changes        in law and regulatory interpretations could reduce its net patient service revenue and profitability and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.The healthcare industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations relating to,        among others:•Payment for services;•Conduct of                        operations, including fraud and abuse, anti-kickback prohibitions, self-referral prohibitions and false claims;•Privacy and security of medical records;•Employment practices; and•Various state approval requirements, such as facility and professional licensure, certificate                            of need, compliance surveys and other certification or recertification requirements.Changes in these laws, rules and regulations or their interpretations could reduce VITAS’ net patient service        revenue and profitability.  VITAS’ ability to comply with such regulations is a key factor in determining the success of its business.  See the “Government Regulations” section of this 10-K for a greater description of these matters.Fraud and          Abuse Laws.  VITAS contracts with a significant number of health care providers and practitioners, including physicians, hospitals and nursing homes and arranges for these entities to provide services to VITAS’ patients.  Some of these        health care providers and practitioners may refer, or be in a position to refer, patients to VITAS (or VITAS may refer patients to them).  These arrangements may not qualify for a safe harbor.  VITAS from time to time seeks guidance from regulatory        counsel as to the changing and evolving interpretations and the potential applicability of the Anti-Kickback Law to its programs, and in response thereto, takes such actions as it deems appropriate.  VITAS generally believes that its contracts and        arrangements with providers, practitioners and suppliers should not be found to violate the Anti-Kickback Law.  However, we cannot assure you that such laws will ultimately be interpreted in a manner consistent with VITAS’ practices.Several health care reform proposals have included an expansion of the Anti-Kickback Law to include referrals of        any patients regardless of payor source, which is similar to the scope of certain laws that have been enacted at the state level.  In addition, a number of states in which VITAS operates have laws, which vary from state to state, prohibiting        certain direct or indirect remuneration or fee-splitting arrangements between health care providers, regardless of payor source, for the referral of patients to a particular provider.The federal Ethics in Patient Referral Act, Section 1877 of the Social Security Act (commonly known as the “Stark        Law”) prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients for “designated health services” to entities in which they hold an ownership or investment interest or with whom they have a compensation arrangement, subject to certain        statutory or regulatory exceptions.  We cannot assure you that future statutory or regulatory changes will not result in hospice services being subject to the Stark Law’s ownership, investment, compensation or referral prohibitions.  Several states        in which VITAS operates have similar laws which likewise are subject to change.  Any such changes could adversely affect the business, financial condition and operating results of VITAS.Further, under separate statutes, submission of claims for items or services that are “not provided as claimed”        may lead to civil money penalties, criminal fines and imprisonment and/or exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federally funded state health care programs.  These false claims statutes include the federal False Claims Act,        which allows any person to bring suit on behalf of the federal government, known as a qui tam action, alleging false or fraudulent        Medicare or Medicaid claims or other violations of the statute and to share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement.Certificate          of Need Laws.  Many states, including Florida, have certificate of need laws or other similar health planning laws that apply to hospice care providers.  These states may require some form of state agency review or approval prior to        opening a new hospice program, to adding or expanding hospice services, to undertaking significant capital expenditures or under other specified circumstances.  Approval under these certificate of need laws is generally conditioned on the showing        of a demonstrable need for services in the community.  VITAS may seek to develop, acquire or expand hospice programs in states having certificate of need laws.  To the extent that state agencies require VITAS to obtain a certificate of need or        other similar approvals to expand services at existing hospice programs or to make acquisitions or develop hospice programs in new or existing geographical markets, VITAS’ plans could be adversely affected by a failure to obtain a certificate or        approval.  In addition, competitors may seek administratively or judicially to challenge such an approval or proposed approval by the state agency.  Such a challenge, whether or not ultimately successful, as well as a state significantly changing        its existing certificate of need rules and regulations, could adversely affect VITAS.16Other          Federal and State Regulations.  The federal government and all states regulate various aspects of the hospice industry and VITAS’ business.  In particular, VITAS’ operations are subject to federal and state health regulatory laws,        including those covering professional services, the dispensing of drugs and certain types of hospice activities.  Certain of VITAS’ employees are subject to state laws and regulations governing professional practice.  VITAS’ operations are subject        to periodic survey by governmental authorities and private accrediting entities to assure compliance with applicable state licensing, and Medicare and Medicaid certification and accreditation standards, as the case may be.  From time to time in the        ordinary course of business, VITAS receives survey reports noting deficiencies for alleged failure to comply with applicable requirements.  VITAS reviews such reports and takes appropriate corrective action.  The failure to effect such action could        result in one of VITAS’ hospice programs being terminated from the Medicare hospice program.  Any termination of one or more of VITAS’ hospice locations from the Medicare hospice program could adversely affect VITAS’ net patient service revenue and        profitability and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.   The failure to obtain, renew or maintain any of the required regulatory approvals, certifications or licenses could materially adversely affect VITAS’ business        and could prevent the programs involved from offering products and services to patients.  In addition, laws and regulations often are adopted to regulate new products, services and industries.  We cannot assure you that either the states or the        federal government will not impose additional regulations on VITAS’ activities, which might materially adversely affect VITAS, including impairing the value of its brand.Claims          Review.  The Medicare and Medicaid programs and their Medicare Administrative Contractors and other payors periodically conduct pre-payment or post-payment reviews and other reviews and audits of health care claims, including hospice        claims.  As a result of such reviews or audits, VITAS could be required to return any amounts found to be overpaid, or amounts found to be overpaid could be recouped through reductions in future payments.  There is pressure from state and federal        governments and other payors to scrutinize health care claims to determine their validity and appropriateness.  VITAS’ claims have been subject to review and audit.  We cannot assure you that reviews and/or similar audits of VITAS’ claims will not        result in material recoupments, denials or other actions that could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business, financial condition and results of operations.Regulation          and Provision of Continuous Home Care.  VITAS provides continuous home care to patients requiring such care.  Continuous home care is provided to allow the patient to remain in their home, during periods of crisis when intensive monitoring        and care, primarily nursing care, is required in order to achieve palliation or management of acute medical symptoms.  Continuous home care requires a minimum of 8 hours of care within a 24-hour day, which begins and ends at midnight.  The care        must be predominantly nursing care provided by either a registered nurse or licensed practical nurse.Continuous home care can be challenging for a hospice to provide for a number of reasons, including the need to        have available sufficient skilled and trained staff to furnish such care, the need to manage the staffing and provision of such care, and a shortage of nurses that can make it particularly difficult to attract and retain nurses that are required to        furnish a majority of such care.  Medicare reimbursement for continuous home care has been calculated by multiplying the applicable continuous home care hourly rate by the number of hours of care provided.  If the care was provided for less than        one hour, Medicare requires reporting in 15-minute increments of care provided, with no rounding.Medicare reimbursement for continuous home care is subject to a number of requirements posing further challenges        for a hospice providing such care.  For example, if a patient requires skilled interventions for palliation or symptom management that can be accomplished in less than 8 aggregate hours within the 24-hour period, if the majority of care can be        accomplished by someone other than a registered nurse or a licensed practical nurse (e.g., if a majority of care is furnished by a home health aide or homemaker), or if for any reason less than 8 hours of direct care are provided (such as when a        patient dies before 8 AM even if 7 or more hours of care has been provided), the care rendered cannot be reimbursed by Medicare at the continuous home care rate (although the care instead may be eligible for Medicare reimbursement at the reduced        routine home care day rate).  As a result of such requirements, VITAS may incur the costs of providing services intended to be continuous home care services yet be unable to bill or be reimbursed for such services at the continuous home care rate.         We cannot assure you that challenges in providing continuous home care will not cause VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profits to materially decline or that reviews and/or similar audits of VITAS’ claims will not result in material        recoupments, denials or other actions that could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business, financial condition and results of operations.17Compliance.         VITAS maintains an internal regulatory compliance review program and from time to time retains regulatory counsel for guidance on compliance matters.  We cannot assure you, however, that VITAS’ practices, if reviewed, would be found to be in        compliance with applicable health regulatory laws, as such laws ultimately may be interpreted, or that any non-compliance with such laws would not have a material adverse effect on VITAS.Federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives could require VITAS to expend substantial sums on        acquiring, implementing and supporting new information systems, which could negatively impact its profitability.There are currently numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives at both the state and federal levels that        address patient privacy concerns.  We cannot predict the total financial or other impact of the regulations on VITAS’ operations.  In addition, although VITAS’ management believes it is in compliance with the requirement of patient privacy        regulations, we cannot assure you that VITAS will not be found to have violated state and federal laws, rules or guidelines surrounding patient privacy.  Compliance with current and future HIPAA and HITECH requirements or any other federal or state        privacy initiatives could require VITAS to make substantial investments, which could negatively impact its profitability and cash flows.VITAS’ growth strategies may not be successful, which could adversely affect its business.A significant element of VITAS’ growth strategy is expected to include expansion of its business in new and        existing markets.  This aspect of VITAS’ growth strategy may not be successful, which could adversely impact its growth and profitability.  We cannot assure you that VITAS will be able to:•Identify markets that meet its selection criteria for new hospice locations;•Hire and retain qualified management teams to operate each of its new hospice locations;•Manage a large and geographically diverse group of hospice locations;•Become Medicare and Medicaid certified in new markets;•Generate sufficient hospice admissions to operate profitably in these new markets;•Compete effectively with existing hospices in new markets; or•Obtain state licensure and/or a certificate of need from appropriate state agencies in new markets.VITAS’ loss of key management personnel or its inability to hire and retain skilled employees could adversely        affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.VITAS’ future success significantly depends upon the continued service of its senior management personnel.  The        loss of one or more of VITAS’ key senior management personnel or its inability to hire and retain new skilled employees could negatively impact VITAS’ ability to maintain or increase patient referrals, a key aspect of its growth strategy, and could        adversely affect its future operating results.Competition for skilled employees is intense, and the process of locating and recruiting skilled employees with        the combination of qualifications and attributes required to care effectively for terminally ill patients and their families can be difficult and lengthy.  We cannot assure you that VITAS will be successful in attracting, retaining or training        highly skilled nursing, management, community education, operations, admissions and other personnel.  VITAS’ business could be disrupted and its growth and profitability negatively impacted if it is unable to attract and retain skilled employees.A nationwide shortage of qualified nurses could adversely affect VITAS’          profitability, growth and ability to continue to provide quality, responsive hospice services to its patients as nursing wages and benefits increase.A significant portion of VITAS’ workforce is licensed nurses.  VITAS depends on qualified nurses to provide        quality, responsive hospice services to its patients.  The current nationwide shortage of qualified nurses impacts some of the markets in which VITAS provides hospice services.  In response to this shortage, VITAS has adjusted its wages and        benefits to recruit and retain nurses and to engage contract nurses.  VITAS’ inability to attract and retain qualified nurses could adversely affect its ability to provide quality, responsive hospice services to its patients and its ability to        increase or maintain patient census in those markets.  Increases in the wages and benefits required to attract and retain qualified nurses or an increase in reliance on contract nurses could negatively impact profitability. 18 VITAS may not be able to compete successfully against other hospice providers, and competitive pressures may limit        its ability to maintain or increase its market position and adversely affect its profitability, financial condition and results of operations.Hospice care in the United States is highly competitive.  In many areas in which VITAS’ hospices are located, they        compete with a large number of organizations, including:•Community-based hospice providers;•National and regional companies;•Hospital-based hospice and palliative care programs;•Physician groups;•Nursing homes;•Home health agencies;•Infusion therapy companies; and•Nursing agencies.Various health care companies have diversified into the hospice industry.  Other companies, including hospitals        and health care organizations that are not currently providing hospice care, may enter the markets VITAS serves and expand the variety of services offered to include hospice care.  We cannot assure you that VITAS will not encounter increased        competition in the future that could limit its ability to maintain or increase its market position, including competition from parties in a position to impact referrals to VITAS.  Such increased competition could have a material adverse effect on        VITAS’ business, financial condition and results of operations.If VITAS fails to comply with          the terms of the CIA, it could be subject to substantial monetary penalties or suspension or exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.VITAS and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a CIA with the Office of the OIG on October 30, 2017 in        connection with the settlement of a False Claims Act Case.  The CIA formalizes various aspects of VITAS’ already existing Compliance Program and contains requirements designed to document compliance with federal healthcare program requirements. It        has a term of five years during which it imposes monitoring, reporting, certification, oversight, screening and training obligations, certain of which have previously been implemented by VITAS.  It also requires VITAS to engage an Independent        Review Organization to perform auditing and review functions and to prepare reports regarding compliance with federal healthcare programs.  In the event of breach of the CIA, VITAS could become liable for payment of stipulated penalties or could be        excluded from participation in federal healthcare programs.Changes in rates or methods of payment for VITAS’ services could adversely affect its revenues and profits.Managed care organizations have grown substantially in terms of the percentage of the population they cover and        their control over an increasing portion of the health care economy.  Managed care organizations have continued to consolidate to enhance their ability to influence the delivery of health care services and to exert pressure to control health care        costs.  VITAS has a number of contractual arrangements with managed care organizations and other similar parties.VITAS provides hospice care to many Medicare beneficiaries who have elected Medicare managed care.  Under such        contracts between HMOs and the federal Department of Health and Human Services, the Medicare payments for hospice services are excluded from the per-member, per-month payment from Medicare to HMOs and instead are paid directly by Medicare to the        hospices.  As a result, VITAS’ payments for Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare risk HMOs are processed in the same way with the same rates as other Medicare beneficiaries.  We cannot assure, however, that payment for hospice services will        continue to be excluded from HMO payment under Medicare risk contracts and similar Medicare managed care plans or that if not excluded, managed care organizations or other large third-party payors would not use their power to influence and exert        pressure on health care providers to reduce costs in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business, financial condition and results of operations.19Liability claims may have an adverse effect on VITAS, and its insurance coverage may be inadequate.Participants in the hospice industry are subject to lawsuits alleging negligence, product liability, wage and hour        or other similar legal theories, many of which involve large claims and significant defense costs.  We are also subject to the risk of lawsuits under the False Claims Act and comparable state laws for allegedly submitting fraudulent bills for        services to the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other federal and state healthcare programs.  These lawsuits, which may be initiated by “whistleblowers” can involve significant monetary damages, fines, attorneys’ fees and the award of bounties        to private qui tam plaintiffs. From time to time, VITAS is subject to such and other types of lawsuits.  See the description below under Legal        Proceedings.  The ultimate liability for claims, if any, could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or operating results.  Although VITAS currently maintains liability insurance intended to cover the claims, we cannot assure        you that the coverage limits of such insurance policies will be adequate or that all such claims will be covered by the insurance.  In addition, VITAS’ insurance policies must be renewed annually and may be subject to cancellation during the policy        period.  While VITAS has been able to obtain liability insurance in the past, such insurance varies in cost, and may not be available in the future on terms acceptable to VITAS, if at all.A successful claim in excess of the insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on VITAS.  Claims,        regardless of their merit or eventual outcome, also may have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business and reputation due to the costs of litigation, diversion of management’s time and related publicity.VITAS procures professional liability coverage on a claims-made basis.  The insurance contracts specify that        coverage is available only during the term of each insurance contract.  VITAS’ management intends to renew or replace the existing claims-made policy annually but such coverage is difficult to obtain, may be subject to cancellation and may be        written by carriers that are unable, or unwilling to pay claims. Additionally, some risks and liabilities, including claims for punitive damages, are not covered by insurance.CybersecurityIn the normal course of business, our information technology systems hold sensitive patient information including        patient demographic data, eligibility for various medical plans including Medicare and Medicaid and protected health information.  Additionally, we utilize those same systems to perform our day-to-day activities, such as receiving referrals,        assigning medical teams to patients, documenting medical information and maintaining an accurate record of all transactions.  We have not experienced any known attacks on our information technology systems that have compromised patient data or the        Company’s proprietary data.  We maintain our information technology systems with safeguard protection against cyber-attacks including active intrusion protection, firewalls and virus detection software.  As discussed previously, we are subject to        and comply with HIPAA and HITECH regulations.  We have developed and tested a response plan in the event of a successful attack and we maintain commercial insurance related to a cyber-attack. However, these safeguards do not ensure that a        significant cyber-attack could not occur.  A successful attack on our information technology systems could have significant consequences to the business including liability for compromised patient information and business interruption.We are regularly the target of attempted cyber and other security threats and must continuously monitor and        develop our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent, detect, address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact.  Insider or employee cyber and        security threats are increasingly a concern for all large companies, including ours.VITAS’ success is highly dependent on its brand reputationVITAS’ reputation for performing quality routine and high acuity patient hospice care within the regulations        mandated by Medicare, Medicaid and commercial payors is critical to our success.  Failure to provide quality patient care within the regulations mandated by our third-party payors, or the perception of inappropriate care resulting in adverse        publicity, litigation or a campaign of negative on-line reviews are some of the factors that could negatively impact VITAS’ national reputation.  VITAS maintains a reputation management risk program however, a loss of brand reputation at VITAS        could adversely affect referral sources’ willingness to refer our service and thus, adversely affect our future operating performance.VITAS’ headquarters and a significant portion of its operations are in south FloridaThe occurrence of a natural disaster in any region that VITAS has significant operations could have a negative        impact on the business.  VITAS’ headquarters are located in Miami, Florida.  In addition, two of our largest programs are in south Florida.  The location of our headquarters and these large programs increases our exposure to hurricanes.  A major        hurricane in south Florida could impede our ability to bill for our services, operate our businesses and serve our patients in the affected area.  VITAS maintains a disaster recovery program to mitigate this risk however, natural disasters could        have an adverse effect on our future operating performance.20"
3,CHE,CHEMED CORP,2018-02-26,"  Risk Factors
You should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all of the information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, in evaluating us and our Capital Stock  They are not the only ones facing the Company.  Other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.GENERALWe have incurred debt to finance the operations of the Company.The Company has debt service obligations that may restrict our operating flexibility.  We cannot assure you that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to service our debt, which may require us to borrow additional funds, or restructure or otherwise refinance our debt.  In addition, the Company has the ability to expand its debt and borrowing capacity subject to various restrictions and covenants defined by its creditors.  The interest rate the Company pays will fluctuate from time to time based upon a number of factors including current LIBOR rates and Company operating performance.  Significant changes in these factors could result in a material change in the Company’s interest expense.Our ability to repay or to refinance our indebtedness and to pay interest on our indebtedness will depend on our operating performance, which may be affected by factors beyond our control.  These factors could include operating difficulties, increased operating costs, our competitors’ actions and regulatory developments.  Our ability to meet our debt service and other obligations may depend in significant part on the extent to which we successfully implement our business strategy.  We cannot assure you that we will be able to implement our strategy fully or that the anticipated results of our strategy will be realized.  Credit market conditions may make it difficult for us to obtain new financing or refinance our current debt on terms and conditions acceptable to us.If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional equity capital or restructure our debt.  We cannot assure you that our cash flows and capital resources will be sufficient to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness in the future or that alternative measures would successfully meet our debt service obligations.The agreements and instruments governing our outstanding debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business and adversely affect the price of our Capital Stock.The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our instruments of indebtedness restrict our ability to incur additional debt; issue and sell capital stock of subsidiaries; sell assets; engage in transactions with affiliates; restrict distributions from subsidiaries; incur liens; engage in business other than permitted businesses; engage in sale/leaseback transactions; engage in mergers or consolidations; make capital expenditures; make guarantees; make investments and acquisitions; enter into operating leases; hedge interest rates; and prepay other debt.Moreover, if we are unable to meet the terms of the financial covenants or if we breach any of these covenants, a default could result under one or more of these agreements.  A default, if not waived by our lenders, could accelerate repayment of our outstanding indebtedness.  If acceleration occurs, we may not be able to repay our debt and it is unlikely that we would be able to borrow sufficient additional funds to refinance such debt on acceptable terms.  In the event of any default under our credit facilities, the lenders thereunder could elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, to be due and payable, and to require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings, any of which would be an event of default.12We depend on our management team and the loss of their service could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of our executive management team.  The loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract or retain other skilled personnel in the future.Environmental compliance costs and liabilities could increase our expenses and adversely affect our financial condition.Our operations are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that prohibit or restrict the discharge of pollutants into the environment and regulate employee exposure to hazardous substance in the workplace.  Failure to comply with these laws could subject us to material costs and liabilities, including civil and criminal fines, costs to cleanup contamination we cause and, in some circumstances, costs to cleanup contamination we discover on our own property but did not cause.Because we use and generate hazardous materials in some of our operations, we are potentially subject to material liabilities relating to the cleanup of contamination and personal injury claims.  In addition, we have retained certain environmental liabilities in connection with the sale of former businesses.  We are currently funding the cleanup of historical contamination at one of our former properties and contributing to the cleanup of third-party sites as a result of our sale of our former subsidiary DuBois Chemicals Inc.  Although we have established a reserve for these liabilities, actual cleanup costs may exceed our current estimates due to factors beyond our control, such as the discovery of additional contamination or the enforcement of more stringent cleanup requirements.  New laws and regulations or their stricter enforcement, the discovery of presently unknown conditions or the receipt of additional claims for indemnification could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities including impairment of our brand that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to certain anti-takeover statutes that might make it more difficult to effect a change in control of the Company.We are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits us from engaging in a “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.  The application of Section 203 could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control that could be advantageous to stockholders.An adverse ruling against us in certain litigation could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.We are involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of our business currently and from time to time.  The damages claimed against us in some of these cases can be substantial.  See the “Legal Proceedings” sections of this 10-K for discussion of particular matters. We cannot assure you that we will prevail in pending cases.  Regardless of the outcome, such litigation is costly to manage, investigate and defend, and the related defense costs, diversion of management’s time and related publicity may adversely affect the conduct of our business and the results of our operations.ROTO-ROOTERWe face intense competition from numerous, fragmented competitors.  If we do not compete effectively, our business may suffer.We face intense competition from numerous competitors.  The sewer, drain and pipe cleaning, excavation, plumbing repair and water restoration businesses are highly fragmented, with the bulk of the industries consisting of local and regional competitors.  We compete primarily on the basis of advertising, range of services provided, name recognition, availability of emergency service, speed and quality of customer service, service guarantees and pricing.  Our competitors may succeed in developing new or enhanced products and services more successful than ours and in marketing and selling existing and new products and services better than we do.  In addition, new competitors may emerge.  We cannot make any assurances that we will continue to be able to compete successfully with any of these companies.13Our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations, exposing us to potential claims and compliance costs that could adversely affect our business.We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to franchising, insurance and other aspects of our business.  These are discussed in greater detail under “Government Regulations” in the Description of Business section hereof.  If we fail to comply with existing or future laws and regulations, we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines and sanctions.  Our franchising activities are subject to various federal and state franchising laws and regulations, including the rules and regulations of the FTC regarding the offering or sale of franchises.  These rules and regulations require us to provide all of our prospective franchisees with specific information regarding us and our franchise program in the form of a detailed franchise offering circular.  In addition, a number of states require us to register our franchise offering prior to offering or selling franchises in such states.  Various state laws also provide for certain rights in favor of franchisees, including (i) limitations on the franchisor’s ability to terminate a franchise except for good cause, (ii) restrictions on the franchisor’s ability to deny renewal of a franchise, (iii) circumstances under which the franchisor may be required to purchase certain inventory of franchisees when a franchise is terminated or not renewed in violation of such laws and (iv) provisions relating to arbitration.  The ability to engage in the plumbing repair business is also subject to certain limitations and restrictions imposed by the state and local licensing laws and regulations.   We cannot predict what legislation or regulations affecting our business will be enacted in the future, how existing or future laws or regulations will be enforced, administered and interpreted, or the amount of future expenditures that may be required to comply with these laws or regulations.  Compliance costs associated with governmental regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Roto-Rooter’s loss of key management personnel or its inability to hire and retain skilled employees could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.Roto-Rooter’s future success significantly depends upon the continued service of its senior management personnel.  The loss of one or more of Roto-Rooter’s key senior management personnel or its inability to hire and retain new skilled employees could negatively impact its ability to maintain or increase customer calls and jobs, a key aspect of its growth strategy, and could adversely affect its future operating results.Competition for skilled employees, particularly licensed plumbers, is intense, and the process of locating and recruiting skilled employees with the combination of qualifications and attributes required to adequately perform plumbing duties can be difficult and lengthy.  We cannot assure you that Roto-Rooter will be successful in attracting, retaining or training highly skilled personnel.  Roto-Rooter’s business could be disrupted and its growth and profitability negatively impacted if it is unable to attract and retain skilled employees.CybersecurityIn the normal course of business, our information technology systems hold sensitive customer information including names, addresses and partial credit card information.  Additionally, we utilize those same systems to perform our day-to-day activities, such as receiving customer calls, dispatching technicians to jobs and maintaining an accurate record of all transactions.  We have not experienced any known attacks on our information technology systems that compromised customer data or the Company’s proprietary data.  We maintain our information technology systems with safeguard protection against cyber-attacks including intrusion detection and protection services, firewalls and virus detection software.  Additionally, on a quarterly basis, we test our information technology systems by using cyber-scanning software and other methods to learn how a successful attack may be made.  We remedy any issues encountered during these tests.  We have developed and tested a response plan in the event of a successful attack and we maintain commercial insurance related to a cyber-attack.  However, these safeguards do not ensure that a significant cyber-attack could not occur.  A successful attack on our information technology systems could have significant consequences to the business including liability for compromised customer information and business interruption.We are regularly the target of attempted cyber and other security threats and must continuously monitor and develop our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent, detect, address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact.  Insider or employee cyber and security threats are increasingly a concern for all large companies, including ours.14Roto-Rooter’s success is highly dependent on its brand reputationRoto-Rooter’s national reputation and brand image for performing necessary, high quality services in a timely manner is critical to Roto-Rooter’s continued success.  Adverse publicity, litigation or on-line negative reviews focused on the Roto-Rooter brand could negatively impact Roto-Rooter’s national reputation resulting in decreased future demand for Roto-Rooter branded services.  Roto-Rooter maintains a reputation management risk program, however, a loss of brand reputation at Roto-Rooter could adversely affect consumer willingness to use our service and thus, adversely affect our future operating performance.VITASVITAS is highly dependent on payments from Medicare and Medicaid.  If there are changes in the rate or methods governing these payments, VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profits could materially decline.In excess of 95% of VITAS’ net patient service revenue consists of payments from the Medicare and Medicaid programs.  Such payments are made primarily on a “per diem” basis, subject to annual reimbursement caps.  Because VITAS receives a per diem fee to provide eligible services to all patients, VITAS’ profitability is largely dependent upon its ability to manage the costs of providing hospice services to patients.  Increases in operating costs, such as labor and supply costs that are subject to inflation, without a compensating increase in Medicare and Medicaid rates, could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business in the future.  Medicare and Medicaid currently adjust the various hospice payment rates annually based primarily on the increase or decrease of the hospital wage index basket, regionally adjusted.  However, the increases may be less than actual inflation.  VITAS’ profitability could be negatively impacted if this adjustment were eliminated or reduced, or if VITAS’ costs of providing hospice services increased more than the annual adjustment.  In addition, cost pressures resulting from shorter patient lengths of stay and the use of more expensive forms of palliative care, including drugs and drug delivery systems, could negatively impact VITAS’ profitability.  Many payors are increasing pressure to control health care costs.  In addition, both public and private payors are increasing pressure to decrease, or limit increases in, reimbursement rates for health care services.  VITAS’ levels of revenue and profitability will be subject to the effect of possible reductions in coverage or payment rates by third-party payors, including payment rates from Medicare and Medicaid.Each state that maintains a Medicaid program has the option to provide reimbursement for hospice services at reimbursement rates generally required to be at least as much as Medicare rates.  All states in which VITAS operates cover Medicaid hospice services; however, we cannot assure you that the states in which VITAS is presently operating or states into which VITAS could expand operations will continue to cover Medicaid hospice services.  In addition, the Medicare and Medicaid programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive and prospective rate and payment adjustments, administrative rulings, freezes and funding reductions, all of which may adversely affect the level of program payments and could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business.  We cannot assure that Medicare and/or Medicaid payments to hospices will not decrease.  Reductions in amounts paid by government programs for services or changes in methods or regulations governing payments could cause VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profits to materially decline.Approximately 20% of VITAS’ days of care are provided to patients who reside in nursing homes. Changes in the laws and regulations regarding payments for hospice services and “room and board” provided to VITAS’ hospice patients residing in nursing homes could reduce its net patient service revenue and profitability.For VITAS’ hospice patients receiving nursing home care under certain state Medicaid programs who elect hospice care under Medicare and Medicaid, the state generally must pay VITAS, in addition to the applicable Medicare or Medicaid hospice per diem rate, an amount equal to at least 95% of the Medicaid per diem nursing home rate for “room and board” furnished to the patient by the nursing home.  VITAS contracts with various nursing homes for the nursing homes’ provision of certain “room and board” services that the nursing homes would otherwise provide Medicaid nursing home patients.  VITAS bills and collects from the applicable state Medicaid program an amount equal to approximately 95% of the amount that would otherwise have been paid directly to the nursing home under the state’s Medicaid plan.  Under VITAS’ standard nursing home contracts, it pays the nursing home for these “room and board” services at approximately 100% of the Medicaid per diem nursing home rate.The reduction or elimination of Medicare and Medicaid payments for hospice patients residing in nursing homes would reduce VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profitability.  In addition, changes in the way nursing homes are reimbursed for “room and board” services provided to hospice patients residing in nursing homes could affect VITAS’ ability to serve patients in nursing homes.15If VITAS is unable to maintain relationships with existing patient referral sources or to establish new referral sources, VITAS’ growth and profitability could be adversely affected.VITAS’ success is heavily dependent on referrals from physicians, long-term care facilities, hospitals and other institutional health care providers, managed care companies, insurance companies and other patient referral sources in the communities that its hospice locations serve, as well as on its ability to maintain good relations with these referral sources.  VITAS’ referral sources may refer their patients to other hospice care providers or not to a hospice provider at all.  VITAS’ growth and profitability depend significantly on its ability to establish and maintain close working relationships with these patient referral sources and to increase awareness and acceptance of hospice care by its referral sources and their patients.  We cannot assure that VITAS will be able to maintain its existing relationships or that it will be able to develop and maintain new relationships in existing or new markets.  VITAS’ loss of existing relationships or its failure to develop new relationships could adversely affect its ability to expand or maintain its operations and operate profitably.  Moreover, we cannot assure you that awareness or acceptance of hospice care will increase or remain at current levels.VITAS operates in an industry that is subject to extensive government regulation and claims reviews, and changes in law and regulatory interpretations could reduce its net patient service revenue and profitability and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.The healthcare industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations relating to, among others: ·Payment for services;·Conduct of operations, including fraud and abuse, anti-kickback prohibitions, self-referral prohibitions and false claims;·Privacy and security of medical records;·Employment practices; and·Various state approval requirements, such as facility and professional licensure, certificate of need, compliance surveys and other certification or recertification requirements.Changes in these laws, rules and regulations or their interpretations could reduce VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profitability.  VITAS’ ability to comply with such regulations is a key factor in determining the success of its business.  See the “Government Regulations” section of this 10-K for a greater description of these matters.Fraud and Abuse Laws.  VITAS contracts with a significant number of health care providers and practitioners, including physicians, hospitals and nursing homes and arranges for these entities to provide services to VITAS’ patients.  Some of these health care providers and practitioners may refer, or be in a position to refer, patients to VITAS (or VITAS may refer patients to them).  These arrangements may not qualify for a safe harbor.  VITAS from time to time seeks guidance from regulatory counsel as to the changing and evolving interpretations and the potential applicability of the Anti-Kickback Law to its programs, and in response thereto, takes such actions as it deems appropriate.  VITAS generally believes that its contracts and arrangements with providers, practitioners and suppliers should not be found to violate the Anti-Kickback Law.  However, we cannot assure you that such laws will ultimately be interpreted in a manner consistent with VITAS’ practices.Several health care reform proposals have included an expansion of the Anti-Kickback Law to include referrals of any patients regardless of payor source, which is similar to the scope of certain laws that have been enacted at the state level.  In addition, a number of states in which VITAS operates have laws, which vary from state to state, prohibiting certain direct or indirect remuneration or fee-splitting arrangements between health care providers, regardless of payor source, for the referral of patients to a particular provider.The federal Ethics in Patient Referral Act, Section 1877 of the Social Security Act (commonly known as the “Stark Law”) prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients for “designated health services” to entities in which they hold an ownership or investment interest or with whom they have a compensation arrangement, subject to certain statutory or regulatory exceptions.  We cannot assure you that future statutory or regulatory changes will not result in hospice services being subject to the Stark Law’s ownership, investment, compensation or referral prohibitions.  Several states in which VITAS operates have similar laws which likewise are subject to change.  Any such changes could adversely affect the business, financial condition and operating results of VITAS.Further, under separate statutes, submission of claims for items or services that are “not provided as claimed” may lead to civil money penalties, criminal fines and imprisonment and/or exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federally funded state health care programs.  These false claims statutes include the federal False Claims Act, which allows any person to bring suit on behalf of the federal government, known as a qui tam action, alleging false or fraudulent Medicare or Medicaid claims or other violations of the statute and to share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement.16Certificate of Need Laws.  Many states, including Florida, have certificate of need laws or other similar health planning laws that apply to hospice care providers.  These states may require some form of state agency review or approval prior to opening a new hospice program, to adding or expanding hospice services, to undertaking significant capital expenditures or under other specified circumstances.  Approval under these certificate of need laws is generally conditioned on the showing of a demonstrable need for services in the community.  VITAS may seek to develop, acquire or expand hospice programs in states having certificate of need laws.  To the extent that state agencies require VITAS to obtain a certificate of need or other similar approvals to expand services at existing hospice programs or to make acquisitions or develop hospice programs in new or existing geographical markets, VITAS’ plans could be adversely affected by a failure to obtain a certificate or approval.  In addition, competitors may seek administratively or judicially to challenge such an approval or proposed approval by the state agency.  Such a challenge, whether or not ultimately successful, as well as a state significantly changing its existing certificate of need rules and regulations, could adversely affect VITAS.Other Federal and State Regulations. The federal government and all states regulate various aspects of the hospice industry and VITAS’ business.  In particular, VITAS’ operations are subject to federal and state health regulatory laws, including those covering professional services, the dispensing of drugs and certain types of hospice activities.  Certain of VITAS’ employees are subject to state laws and regulations governing professional practice.  VITAS’ operations are subject to periodic survey by governmental authorities and private accrediting entities to assure compliance with applicable state licensing, and Medicare and Medicaid certification and accreditation standards, as the case may be.  From time to time in the ordinary course of business, VITAS receives survey reports noting deficiencies for alleged failure to comply with applicable requirements.  VITAS reviews such reports and takes appropriate corrective action.  The failure to effect such action could result in one of VITAS’ hospice programs being terminated from the Medicare hospice program.  Any termination of one or more of VITAS’ hospice locations from the Medicare hospice program could adversely affect VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profitability and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.   The failure to obtain, renew or maintain any of the required regulatory approvals, certifications or licenses could materially adversely affect VITAS’ business and could prevent the programs involved from offering products and services to patients.  In addition, laws and regulations often are adopted to regulate new products, services and industries.  We cannot assure you that either the states or the federal government will not impose additional regulations on VITAS’ activities, which might materially adversely affect VITAS, including impairing the value of its brand.Claims Review.  The Medicare and Medicaid programs and their Medicare Administrative Contractors and other payors periodically conduct pre-payment or post-payment reviews and other reviews and audits of health care claims, including hospice claims.  As a result of such reviews or audits, VITAS could be required to return any amounts found to be overpaid, or amounts found to be overpaid could be recouped through reductions in future payments.  There is pressure from state and federal governments and other payors to scrutinize health care claims to determine their validity and appropriateness.  VITAS’ claims have been subject to review and audit.  We cannot assure you that reviews and/or similar audits of VITAS’ claims will not result in material recoupments, denials or other actions that could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business, financial condition and results of operations.Regulation and Provision of Continuous Home Care.  VITAS provides continuous home care to patients requiring such care.  Continuous home care is provided to allow the patient to remain in their home, during periods of crisis when intensive monitoring and care, primarily nursing care, is required in order to achieve palliation or management of acute medical symptoms.  Continuous home care requires a minimum of 8 hours of care within a 24-hour day, which begins and ends at midnight.  The care must be predominantly nursing care provided by either a registered nurse or licensed practical nurse.Continuous home care can be challenging for a hospice to provide for a number of reasons, including the need to have available sufficient skilled and trained staff to furnish such care, the need to manage the staffing and provision of such care, and a shortage of nurses that can make it particularly difficult to attract and retain nurses that are required to furnish a majority of such care.  Medicare reimbursement for continuous home care has been calculated by multiplying the applicable continuous home care hourly rate by the number of hours of care provided.  If the care was provided for less than one hour, Medicare requires reporting in 15-minute increments of care provided, with no rounding.Medicare reimbursement for continuous home care is subject to a number of requirements posing further challenges for a hospice providing such care.  For example, if a patient requires skilled interventions for palliation or symptom management that can be accomplished in less than 8 aggregate hours within the 24-hour period, if the majority of care can be accomplished by someone other than a registered nurse or a licensed practical nurse (e.g., if a majority of care is furnished by a home health aide or homemaker), or if for any reason less than 8 hours of direct care are provided (such as when a patient dies before 8 AM even if 7 or more hours of care has been provided), the care rendered cannot be reimbursed by Medicare at the continuous home care rate (although the care instead may be eligible for Medicare reimbursement at the reduced routine home care day rate).  As a result of such requirements, VITAS may incur the costs of providing services intended to be continuous home care services yet be unable to bill or be reimbursed for such services at the continuous home care rate.  We cannot assure you that challenges in providing continuous home care will not cause VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profits to materially decline or that reviews and/or similar audits of VITAS’ claims will not result in material recoupments, denials or other actions that could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business, financial condition and results of operations.17Compliance.  VITAS maintains an internal regulatory compliance review program and from time to time retains regulatory counsel for guidance on compliance matters.  We cannot assure you, however, that VITAS’ practices, if reviewed, would be found to be in compliance with applicable health regulatory laws, as such laws ultimately may be interpreted, or that any non-compliance with such laws would not have a material adverse effect on VITAS.Federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives could require VITAS to expend substantial sums on acquiring, implementing and supporting new information systems, which could negatively impact its profitability.There are currently numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives at both the state and federal levels that address patient privacy concerns.  We cannot predict the total financial or other impact of the regulations on VITAS’ operations.  In addition, although VITAS’ management believes it is in compliance with the requirement of patient privacy regulations, we cannot assure you that VITAS will not be found to have violated state and federal laws, rules or guidelines surrounding patient privacy.  Compliance with current and future HIPAA and HITECH requirements or any other federal or state privacy initiatives could require VITAS to make substantial investments, which could negatively impact its profitability and cash flows.VITAS’ growth strategies may not be successful, which could adversely affect its business.A significant element of VITAS’ growth strategy is expected to include expansion of its business in new and existing markets.  This aspect of VITAS’ growth strategy may not be successful, which could adversely impact its growth and profitability.  We cannot assure you that VITAS will be able to:·Identify markets that meet its selection criteria for new hospice locations;·Hire and retain qualified management teams to operate each of its new hospice locations;·Manage a large and geographically diverse group of hospice locations;·Become Medicare and Medicaid certified in new markets;·Generate sufficient hospice admissions to operate profitably in these new markets;·Compete effectively with existing hospices in new markets; or·Obtain state licensure and/or a certificate of need from appropriate state agencies in new markets.VITAS’ loss of key management personnel or its inability to hire and retain skilled employees could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.VITAS’ future success significantly depends upon the continued service of its senior management personnel.  The loss of one or more of VITAS’ key senior management personnel or its inability to hire and retain new skilled employees could negatively impact VITAS’ ability to maintain or increase patient referrals, a key aspect of its growth strategy, and could adversely affect its future operating results.Competition for skilled employees is intense, and the process of locating and recruiting skilled employees with the combination of qualifications and attributes required to care effectively for terminally ill patients and their families can be difficult and lengthy.  We cannot assure you that VITAS will be successful in attracting, retaining or training highly skilled nursing, management, community education, operations, admissions and other personnel.  VITAS’ business could be disrupted and its growth and profitability negatively impacted if it is unable to attract and retain skilled employees.18  A nationwide shortage of qualified nurses could adversely affect VITAS’ profitability, growth and ability to continue to provide quality, responsive hospice services to its patients as nursing wages and benefits increase.Approximately 40% of VITAS’ workforce is licensed nurses.  VITAS depends on qualified nurses to provide quality, responsive hospice services to its patients.  The current nationwide shortage of qualified nurses impacts some of the markets in which VITAS provides hospice services.  In response to this shortage, VITAS has adjusted its wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and to engage contract nurses.  VITAS’ inability to attract and retain qualified nurses could adversely affect its ability to provide quality, responsive hospice services to its patients and its ability to increase or maintain patient census in those markets.  Increases in the wages and benefits required to attract and retain qualified nurses or an increase in reliance on contract nurses could negatively impact profitability. VITAS may not be able to compete successfully against other hospice providers, and competitive pressures may limit its ability to maintain or increase its market position and adversely affect its profitability, financial condition and results of operations.Hospice care in the United States is highly competitive.  In many areas in which VITAS’ hospices are located, they compete with a large number of organizations, including:·Community-based hospice providers;·National and regional companies;·Hospital-based hospice and palliative care programs;·Physician groups;·Nursing homes;·Home health agencies;·Infusion therapy companies; and·Nursing agencies.Various health care companies have diversified into the hospice industry.  Other companies, including hospitals and health care organizations that are not currently providing hospice care, may enter the markets VITAS serves and expand the variety of services offered to include hospice care.  We cannot assure you that VITAS will not encounter increased competition in the future that could limit its ability to maintain or increase its market position, including competition from parties in a position to impact referrals to VITAS.  Such increased competition could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business, financial condition and results of operations.If VITAS fails to comply with the terms of the CIA, it could be subject to substantial monetary penalties or suspension or exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.VITAS and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a CIA with the Office of the OIG on October 30, 2017 in connection with the settlement of a False Claims Act Case.  The CIA formalizes various aspects of VITAS’ already existing Compliance Program and contains requirements designed to document compliance with federal healthcare program requirements. It has a term of five years during which it imposes monitoring, reporting, certification, oversight, screening and training obligations, certain of which have previously been implemented by VITAS.  It also requires VITAS to engage an Independent Review Organization to perform auditing and review functions and to prepare reports regarding compliance with federal healthcare programs.  In the event of breach of the CIA, VITAS could become liable for payment of stipulated penalties or could be excluded from participation in federal healthcare programs.Changes in rates or methods of payment for VITAS’ services could adversely affect its revenues and profits.Managed care organizations have grown substantially in terms of the percentage of the population they cover and their control over an increasing portion of the health care economy.  Managed care organizations have continued to consolidate to enhance their ability to influence the delivery of health care services and to exert pressure to control health care costs.  VITAS has a number of contractual arrangements with managed care organizations and other similar parties.19VITAS provides hospice care to many Medicare beneficiaries who have elected Medicare managed care.  Under such contracts between HMOs and the federal Department of Health and Human Services, the Medicare payments for hospice services are excluded from the per-member, per-month payment from Medicare to HMOs and instead are paid directly by Medicare to the hospices.  As a result, VITAS’ payments for Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare risk HMOs are processed in the same way with the same rates as other Medicare beneficiaries.  We cannot assure, however, that payment for hospice services will continue to be excluded from HMO payment under Medicare risk contracts and similar Medicare managed care plans or that if not excluded, managed care organizations or other large third-party payors would not use their power to influence and exert pressure on health care providers to reduce costs in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business, financial condition and results of operations.Liability claims may have an adverse effect on VITAS, and its insurance coverage may be inadequate.Participants in the hospice industry are subject to lawsuits alleging negligence, product liability, wage and hour or other similar legal theories, many of which involve large claims and significant defense costs.  We are also subject to the risk of lawsuits under the False Claims Act and comparable state laws for allegedly submitting fraudulent bills for services to the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other federal and state healthcare programs.  These lawsuits, which may be initiated by “whistleblowers” can involve significant monetary damages, fines, attorneys’ fees and the award of bounties to private qui tam plaintiffs. From time to time, VITAS is subject to such and other types of lawsuits.  See the description below under Legal Proceedings.  The ultimate liability for claims, if any, could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or operating results.  Although VITAS currently maintains liability insurance intended to cover the claims, we cannot assure you that the coverage limits of such insurance policies will be adequate or that all such claims will be covered by the insurance.  In addition, VITAS’ insurance policies must be renewed annually and may be subject to cancellation during the policy period.  While VITAS has been able to obtain liability insurance in the past, such insurance varies in cost, and may not be available in the future on terms acceptable to VITAS, if at all.A successful claim in excess of the insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on VITAS.  Claims, regardless of their merit or eventual outcome, also may have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business and reputation due to the costs of litigation, diversion of management’s time and related publicity.VITAS procures professional liability coverage on a claims-made basis.  The insurance contracts specify that coverage is available only during the term of each insurance contract.  VITAS’ management intends to renew or replace the existing claims-made policy annually but such coverage is difficult to obtain, may be subject to cancellation and may be written by carriers that are unable, or unwilling to pay claims. Additionally, some risks and liabilities, including claims for punitive damages, are not covered by insurance.CybersecurityIn the normal course of business, our information technology systems hold sensitive patient information including patient demographic data, eligibility for various medical plans including Medicare and Medicaid and protected health information.  Additionally, we utilize those same systems to perform our day-to-day activities, such as receiving referrals, assigning medical teams to patients, documenting medical information and maintaining an accurate record of all transactions.  We have not experienced any known attacks on our information technology systems that have compromised patient data or the Company’s proprietary data.  We maintain our information technology systems with safeguard protection against cyber-attacks including active intrusion protection, firewalls and virus detection software.  As discussed previously, we are subject to and comply with HIPPA and HITECH regulations.  We have developed and tested a response plan in the event of a successful attack and we maintain commercial insurance related to a cyber-attack. However, these safeguards do not ensure that a significant cyber-attack could not occur.  A successful attack on our information technology systems could have significant consequences to the business including liability for compromised patient information and business interruption.We are regularly the target of attempted cyber and other security threats and must continuously monitor and develop our information technology networks and infrastructure to prevent, detect, address and mitigate the risk of unauthorized access, misuse, computer viruses and other events that could have a security impact.  Insider or employee cyber and security threats are increasingly a concern for all large companies, including ours.20VITAS’ success is highly dependent on its brand reputationVITAS’ reputation for performing quality routine and high acuity patient hospice care within the regulations mandated by Medicare, Medicaid and commercial payors is critical to our success.  Failure to provide quality patient care within the regulations mandated by our third-party payors, or the perception of inappropriate care resulting in adverse publicity, litigation or a campaign of negative on-line reviews are some of the factors that could negatively impact VITAS’ national reputation.  VITAS maintains a reputation management risk program however, a loss of brand reputation at VITAS could adversely affect referral sources’ willingness to refer our service and thus, adversely affect our future operating performance.VITAS’ headquarters and a significant portion of its operations are in south FloridaThe occurrence of a natural disaster in any region that VITAS has significant operations could have a negative impact on the business.  VITAS’ headquarters are located in Miami, Florida.  In addition, two of our largest programs are in south Florida.  The location of our headquarters and these large programs increases our exposure to hurricanes.  A major hurricane in south Florida could impede our ability to bill for our services, operate our businesses and serve our patients’ in the affected area.  VITAS maintains a disaster recovery program to mitigate this risk however, natural disasters could have an adverse effect on our future operating performance"
7,CHE,CHEMED CORP,2017-02-27,"  Risk Factors
You should carefully consider the risks described below.  They are not the only ones facing the Company.  Other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.GENERALWe have incurred debt to finance the operations of the Company.The Company has debt service obligations that may restrict our operating flexibility.  We cannot assure you that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to service our debt, which may require us to borrow additional funds, or restructure or otherwise refinance our debt.  In addition, the Company has the ability to expand its debt and borrowing capacity subject to various restrictions and covenants defined by its creditors.  The interest rate the Company pays will fluctuate from time to time based upon a number of factors including current LIBOR rates and Company operating performance.  Significant changes in these factors could result in a material change in the Company’s interest expense.Our ability to repay or to refinance our indebtedness and to pay interest on our indebtedness will depend on our operating performance, which may be affected by factors beyond our control.  These factors could include operating difficulties, increased operating costs, our competitors’ actions and regulatory developments.  Our ability to meet our debt service and other obligations may depend in significant part on the extent to which we successfully implement our business strategy.  We cannot assure you that we will be able to implement our strategy fully or that the anticipated results of our strategy will be realized.  Credit market conditions may make it difficult for us to obtain new financing or refinance our current debt on terms and conditions acceptable to us. 11 If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional equity capital or restructure our debt.  We cannot assure you that our cash flows and capital resources will be sufficient to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness in the future or that alternative measures would successfully meet our debt service obligations.The agreements and instruments governing our outstanding debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business and adversely affect the price of our Capital Stock.The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our instruments of indebtedness restrict our ability to incur additional debt; issue and sell capital stock of subsidiaries; sell assets; engage in transactions with affiliates; restrict distributions from subsidiaries; incur liens; engage in business other than permitted businesses; engage in sale/leaseback transactions; engage in mergers or consolidations; make capital expenditures; make guarantees; make investments and acquisitions; enter into operating leases; hedge interest rates; and prepay other debt.Moreover, if we are unable to meet the terms of the financial covenants or if we breach any of these covenants, a default could result under one or more of these agreements.  A default, if not waived by our lenders, could accelerate repayment of our outstanding indebtedness.  If acceleration occurs, we may not be able to repay our debt and it is unlikely that we would be able to borrow sufficient additional funds to refinance such debt on acceptable terms.  In the event of any default under our credit facilities, the lenders thereunder could elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, to be due and payable, and to require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings, any of which would be an event of default.We depend on our management team and the loss of their service could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of our executive management team.  The loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract or retain other skilled personnel in the future.Environmental compliance costs and liabilities could increase our expenses and adversely affect our financial condition.Our operations are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that prohibit or restrict the discharge of pollutants into the environment and regulate employee exposure to hazardous substance in the workplace.  Failure to comply with these laws could subject us to material costs and liabilities, including civil and criminal fines, costs to cleanup contamination we cause and, in some circumstances, costs to cleanup contamination we discover on our own property but did not cause.Because we use and generate hazardous materials in some of our operations, we are potentially subject to material liabilities relating to the cleanup of contamination and personal injury claims.  In addition, we have retained certain environmental liabilities in connection with the sale of former businesses.  We are currently funding the cleanup of historical contamination at one of our former properties and contributing to the cleanup of third-party sites as a result of our sale of our former subsidiary DuBois Chemicals Inc.  Although we have established a reserve for these liabilities, actual cleanup costs may exceed our current estimates due to factors beyond our control, such as the discovery of additional contamination or the enforcement of more stringent cleanup requirements.  New laws and regulations or their stricter enforcement, the discovery of presently unknown conditions or the receipt of additional claims for indemnification could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities including impairment of our brand that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to certain anti-takeover statutes that might make it more difficult to effect a change in control of the Company.We are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits us from engaging in a “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.  The application of Section 203 could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control that could be advantageous to stockholders.12An adverse ruling against us in certain litigation could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.We are involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of our business currently and from time to time.  The damages claimed against us in some of these cases are substantial.  See the “Legal Proceedings” sections of this 10-K for discussion of particular matters. We cannot assure you that we will prevail in pending cases.  Regardless of the outcome, such litigation is costly to manage, investigate and defend, and the related defense costs, diversion of management’s time and related publicity may adversely affect the conduct of our business and the results of our operations.ROTO-ROOTERWe face intense competition from numerous, fragmented competitors.  If we do not compete effectively, our business may suffer.We face intense competition from numerous competitors.  The sewer, drain and pipe cleaning, excavation, plumbing repair and water restoration businesses are highly fragmented, with the bulk of the industries consisting of local and regional competitors.  We compete primarily on the basis of advertising, range of services provided, name recognition, availability of emergency service, speed and quality of customer service, service guarantees and pricing.  Our competitors may succeed in developing new or enhanced products and services more successful than ours and in marketing and selling existing and new products and services better than we do.  In addition, new competitors may emerge.  We cannot make any assurances that we will continue to be able to compete successfully with any of these companies.Our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations, exposing us to potential claims and compliance costs that could adversely affect our business.We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to franchising, insurance and other aspects of our business.  These are discussed in greater detail under “Government Regulations” in the Description of Business section hereof.  If we fail to comply with existing or future laws and regulations, we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines and sanctions.  Our franchising activities are subject to various federal and state franchising laws and regulations, including the rules and regulations of the FTC regarding the offering or sale of franchises.  These rules and regulations require us to provide all of our prospective franchisees with specific information regarding us and our franchise program in the form of a detailed franchise offering circular.  In addition, a number of states require us to register our franchise offering prior to offering or selling franchises in such states.  Various state laws also provide for certain rights in favor of franchisees, including (i) limitations on the franchisor’s ability to terminate a franchise except for good cause, (ii) restrictions on the franchisor’s ability to deny renewal of a franchise, (iii) circumstances under which the franchisor may be required to purchase certain inventory of franchisees when a franchise is terminated or not renewed in violation of such laws and (iv) provisions relating to arbitration.  The ability to engage in the plumbing repair business is also subject to certain limitations and restrictions imposed by the state and local licensing laws and regulations.   We cannot predict what legislation or regulations affecting our business will be enacted in the future, how existing or future laws or regulations will be enforced, administered and interpreted, or the amount of future expenditures that may be required to comply with these laws or regulations.  Compliance costs associated with governmental regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Roto-Rooter’s loss of key management personnel or its inability to hire and retain skilled employees could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.Roto-Rooter’s future success significantly depends upon the continued service of its senior management personnel.  The loss of one or more of Roto-Rooter’s key senior management personnel or its inability to hire and retain new skilled employees could negatively impact its ability to maintain or increase customer calls and jobs, a key aspect of its growth strategy, and could adversely affect its future operating results.Competition for skilled employees, particularly licensed plumbers, is intense, and the process of locating and recruiting skilled employees with the combination of qualifications and attributes required to adequately perform plumbing duties can be difficult and lengthy.  We cannot assure you that Roto-Rooter will be successful in attracting, retaining or training highly skilled personnel.  Roto-Rooter’s business could be disrupted and its growth and profitability negatively impacted if it is unable to attract and retain skilled employees.13 CybersecurityIn the normal course of business, our information technology systems hold sensitive customer information including names, addresses and partial credit card information.  Additionally, we utilize those same systems to perform our day-to-day activities, such as receiving customer calls, dispatching technicians to jobs and maintaining an accurate record of all transactions.  We have not experienced any known attacks on our information technology systems that compromised customer data or the Company’s proprietary data.  We maintain our information technology systems with safeguard protection against cyber-attacks including intrusion detection and protection services, firewalls and virus detection software.  Additionally, on a quarterly basis, we test our information technology systems by using cyber-scanning software and other methods to learn how a successful attack may be made.  We remedy any issues encountered during these tests.  We have developed and tested a response plan in the event of a successful attack and we maintain commercial insurance related to a cyber-attack.  However, these safeguards do not ensure that a significant cyber-attack could not occur.  A successful attack on our information technology systems could have significant consequences to the business including liability for compromised customer information and business interruption.Roto-Rooter’s success is highly dependent on its brand reputationRoto-Rooter’s national reputation and brand image for performing necessary, high quality services in a timely manner is critical to Roto-Rooter’s continued success.  Adverse publicity, litigation or on-line negative reviews focused on the Roto-Rooter brand could negatively impact Roto-Rooter’s national reputation resulting in decreased future demand for Roto-Rooter branded services.  Roto-Rooter maintains a reputation management risk program, however, a loss of brand reputation at Roto-Rooter could adversely affect consumer willingness to use our service and thus, adversely affect our future operating performance.VITASVITAS is highly dependent on payments from Medicare and Medicaid.  If there are changes in the rate or methods governing these payments, VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profits could materially decline.In excess of 95% of VITAS’ net patient service revenue consists of payments from the Medicare and Medicaid programs.  Such payments are made primarily on a “per diem” basis, subject to annual reimbursement caps.  Because VITAS receives a per diem fee to provide eligible services to all patients, VITAS’ profitability is largely dependent upon its ability to manage the costs of providing hospice services to patients.  Increases in operating costs, such as labor and supply costs that are subject to inflation, without a compensating increase in Medicare and Medicaid rates, could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business in the future.  Medicare and Medicaid currently adjust the various hospice payment rates annually based primarily on the increase or decrease of the hospital wage index basket, regionally adjusted.  However, the increases may be less than actual inflation.  VITAS’ profitability could be negatively impacted if this adjustment were eliminated or reduced, or if VITAS’ costs of providing hospice services increased more than the annual adjustment.  In addition, cost pressures resulting from shorter patient lengths of stay and the use of more expensive forms of palliative care, including drugs and drug delivery systems, could negatively impact VITAS’ profitability.  Many payors are increasing pressure to control health care costs.  In addition, both public and private payors are increasing pressure to decrease, or limit increases in, reimbursement rates for health care services.  VITAS’ levels of revenue and profitability will be subject to the effect of possible reductions in coverage or payment rates by third-party payors, including payment rates from Medicare and Medicaid.Each state that maintains a Medicaid program has the option to provide reimbursement for hospice services at reimbursement rates generally required to be at least as much as Medicare rates.  All states in which VITAS operates cover Medicaid hospice services; however, we cannot assure you that the states in which VITAS is presently operating or states into which VITAS could expand operations will continue to cover Medicaid hospice services.  In addition, the Medicare and Medicaid programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive and prospective rate and payment adjustments, administrative rulings, freezes and funding reductions, all of which may adversely affect the level of program payments and could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business.  We cannot assure that Medicare and/or Medicaid payments to hospices will not decrease.  Reductions in amounts paid by government programs for services or changes in methods or regulations governing payments could cause VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profits to materially decline.Approximately 20% of VITAS’ days of care are provided to patients who reside in nursing homes. Changes in the laws and regulations regarding payments for hospice services and “room and board” provided to VITAS’ hospice patients residing in nursing homes could reduce its net patient service revenue and profitability. 14 For VITAS’ hospice patients receiving nursing home care under certain state Medicaid programs who elect hospice care under Medicare and Medicaid, the state generally must pay VITAS, in addition to the applicable Medicare or Medicaid hospice per diem rate, an amount equal to at least 95% of the Medicaid per diem nursing home rate for “room and board” furnished to the patient by the nursing home.  VITAS contracts with various nursing homes for the nursing homes’ provision of certain “room and board” services that the nursing homes would otherwise provide Medicaid nursing home patients.  VITAS bills and collects from the applicable state Medicaid program an amount equal to approximately 95% of the amount that would otherwise have been paid directly to the nursing home under the state’s Medicaid plan.  Under VITAS’ standard nursing home contracts, it pays the nursing home for these “room and board” services at approximately 100% of the Medicaid per diem nursing home rate.The reduction or elimination of Medicare and Medicaid payments for hospice patients residing in nursing homes would reduce VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profitability.  In addition, changes in the way nursing homes are reimbursed for “room and board” services provided to hospice patients residing in nursing homes could affect VITAS’ ability to serve patients in nursing homes.If VITAS is unable to maintain relationships with existing patient referral sources or to establish new referral sources, VITAS’ growth and profitability could be adversely affected.VITAS’ success is heavily dependent on referrals from physicians, long-term care facilities, hospitals and other institutional health care providers, managed care companies, insurance companies and other patient referral sources in the communities that its hospice locations serve, as well as on its ability to maintain good relations with these referral sources.  VITAS’ referral sources may refer their patients to other hospice care providers or not to a hospice provider at all.  VITAS’ growth and profitability depend significantly on its ability to establish and maintain close working relationships with these patient referral sources and to increase awareness and acceptance of hospice care by its referral sources and their patients.  We cannot assure that VITAS will be able to maintain its existing relationships or that it will be able to develop and maintain new relationships in existing or new markets.  VITAS’ loss of existing relationships or its failure to develop new relationships could adversely affect its ability to expand or maintain its operations and operate profitably.  Moreover, we cannot assure you that awareness or acceptance of hospice care will increase or remain at current levels.VITAS operates in an industry that is subject to extensive government regulation and claims reviews, and changes in law and regulatory interpretations could reduce its net patient service revenue and profitability and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.The healthcare industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations relating to, among others: ·Payment for services;·Conduct of operations, including fraud and abuse, anti-kickback prohibitions, self-referral prohibitions and false claims;·Privacy and security of medical records;·Employment practices; and·Various state approval requirements, such as facility and professional licensure, certificate of need, compliance surveys and other certification orrecertification requirements. Changes in these laws, rules and regulations or in interpretations thereof could reduce VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profitability.  VITAS’ ability to comply with such regulations is a key factor in determining the success of its business.  See the “Government Regulations” section of this 10-K for a greater description of these matters.Fraud and Abuse Laws.  VITAS contracts with a significant number of health care providers and practitioners, including physicians, hospitals and nursing homes and arranges for these entities to provide services to VITAS’ patients.  Some of these health care providers and practitioners may refer, or be in a position to refer, patients to VITAS (or VITAS may refer patients to them).  These arrangements may not qualify for a safe harbor.  VITAS from time to time seeks guidance from regulatory counsel as to the changing and evolving interpretations and the potential applicability of the Anti-Kickback Law to its programs, and in response thereto, takes such actions as it deems appropriate.  VITAS generally believes that its contracts and arrangements with providers, practitioners and suppliers should not be found to violate the Anti-Kickback Law.  However, we cannot assure you that such laws will ultimately be interpreted in a manner consistent with VITAS’ practices.Several health care reform proposals have included an expansion of the Anti-Kickback Law to include referrals of any patients regardless of payor source, which is similar to the scope of certain laws that have been enacted at the state level.  In addition, a number of states in which VITAS operates have laws, which vary from state to state, prohibiting certain direct or indirect remuneration or fee-splitting arrangements between health care providers, regardless of payor source, for the referral of patients to a particular provider. 15 The federal Ethics in Patient Referral Act, Section 1877 of the Social Security Act (commonly known as the “Stark Law”) prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients for “designated health services” to entities in which they hold an ownership or investment interest or with whom they have a compensation arrangement, subject to certain statutory or regulatory exceptions.  We cannot assure you that future statutory or regulatory changes will not result in hospice services being subject to the Stark Law’s ownership, investment, compensation or referral prohibitions.  Several states in which VITAS operates have similar laws which likewise are subject to change.  Any such changes could adversely affect the business, financial condition and operating results of VITAS.Further, under separate statutes, submission of claims for items or services that are “not provided as claimed” may lead to civil money penalties, criminal fines and imprisonment and/or exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federally funded state health care programs.  These false claims statutes include the federal False Claims Act, which allows any person to bring suit on behalf of the federal government, known as a qui tam action, alleging false or fraudulent Medicare or Medicaid claims or other violations of the statute and to share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement.  See the discussion of the governmental investigations and litigation pending against VITAS under Other Healthcare Regulations, above and Legal Proceedings, below.Certificate of Need Laws.  Many states, including Florida, have certificate of need laws or other similar health planning laws that apply to hospice care providers.  These states may require some form of state agency review or approval prior to opening a new hospice program, to adding or expanding hospice services, to undertaking significant capital expenditures or under other specified circumstances.  Approval under these certificate of need laws is generally conditioned on the showing of a demonstrable need for services in the community.  VITAS may seek to develop, acquire or expand hospice programs in states having certificate of need laws.  To the extent that state agencies require VITAS to obtain a certificate of need or other similar approvals to expand services at existing hospice programs or to make acquisitions or develop hospice programs in new or existing geographical markets, VITAS’ plans could be adversely affected by a failure to obtain a certificate or approval.  In addition, competitors may seek administratively or judicially to challenge such an approval or proposed approval by the state agency.  Such a challenge, whether or not ultimately successful, as well as a state significantly changing its existing certificate of need rules and regulations, could adversely affect VITAS.Other Federal and State Regulations. The federal government and all states regulate various aspects of the hospice industry and VITAS’ business.  In particular, VITAS’ operations are subject to federal and state health regulatory laws, including those covering professional services, the dispensing of drugs and certain types of hospice activities.  Certain of VITAS’ employees are subject to state laws and regulations governing professional practice.  VITAS’ operations are subject to periodic survey by governmental authorities and private accrediting entities to assure compliance with applicable state licensing, and Medicare and Medicaid certification and accreditation standards, as the case may be.  From time to time in the ordinary course of business, VITAS receives survey reports noting deficiencies for alleged failure to comply with applicable requirements.  VITAS reviews such reports and takes appropriate corrective action.  The failure to effect such action could result in one of VITAS’ hospice programs being terminated from the Medicare hospice program.  Any termination of one or more of VITAS’ hospice locations from the Medicare hospice program could adversely affect VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profitability and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.   The failure to obtain, renew or maintain any of the required regulatory approvals, certifications or licenses could materially adversely affect VITAS’ business and could prevent the programs involved from offering products and services to patients.  In addition, laws and regulations often are adopted to regulate new products, services and industries.  We cannot assure you that either the states or the federal government will not impose additional regulations on VITAS’ activities, which might materially adversely affect VITAS, including impairing the value of its brand.Claims Review.  The Medicare and Medicaid programs and their Medicare Administrative Contractors and other payors periodically conduct pre-payment or post-payment reviews and other reviews and audits of health care claims, including hospice claims.  As a result of such reviews or audits, VITAS could be required to return any amounts found to be overpaid, or amounts found to be overpaid could be recouped through reductions in future payments.  There is pressure from state and federal governments and other payors to scrutinize health care claims to determine their validity and appropriateness.  VITAS’ claims have been subject to review and audit.  We cannot assure you that reviews and/or similar audits of VITAS’ claims will not result in material recoupments, denials or other actions that could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business, financial condition and results of operations.  See the discussion of OIG investigations pending against VITAS under Other Health Care Regulations, above. 16 Regulation and Provision of Continuous Home Care.  VITAS provides continuous home care to patients requiring such care.  Continuous home care is provided to allow the patient to remain in their home, during periods of crisis when intensive monitoring and care, primarily nursing care, is required in order to achieve palliation or management of acute medical symptoms.  Continuous home care requires a minimum of 8 hours of care within a 24-hour day, which begins and ends at midnight.  The care must be predominantly nursing care provided by either a registered nurse or licensed practical nurse.Continuous home care can be challenging for a hospice to provide for a number of reasons, including the need to have available sufficient skilled and trained staff to furnish such care, the need to manage the staffing and provision of such care, and a shortage of nurses that can make it particularly difficult to attract and retain nurses that are required to furnish a majority of such care.  Medicare reimbursement for continuous home care has been calculated by multiplying the applicable continuous home care hourly rate by the number of hours of care provided.  If the care was provided for less than one hour, Medicare requires reporting in 15-minute increments of care provided, with no rounding.Medicare reimbursement for continuous home care is subject to a number of requirements posing further challenges for a hospice providing such care.  For example, if a patient requires skilled interventions for palliation or symptom management that can be accomplished in less than 8 aggregate hours within the 24-hour period, if the majority of care can be accomplished by someone other than a registered nurse or a licensed practical nurse (e.g., if a majority of care is furnished by a home health aide or homemaker), or if for any reason less than 8 hours of direct care are provided (such as when a patient dies before 8 AM even if 7 or more hours of care has been provided), the care rendered cannot be reimbursed by Medicare at the continuous home care rate (although the care instead may be eligible for Medicare reimbursement at the reduced routine home care day rate).  As a result of such requirements, VITAS may incur the costs of providing services intended to be continuous home care services yet be unable to bill or be reimbursed for such services at the continuous home care rate.  We cannot assure you that challenges in providing continuous home care will not cause VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profits to materially decline or that reviews and/or similar audits of VITAS’ claims will not result in material recoupments, denials or other actions that could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business, financial condition and results of operations.Compliance.  VITAS maintains an internal regulatory compliance review program and from time to time retains regulatory counsel for guidance on compliance matters.  We cannot assure you, however, that VITAS’ practices, if reviewed, would be found to be in compliance with applicable health regulatory laws, as such laws ultimately may be interpreted, or that any non-compliance with such laws would not have a material adverse effect on VITAS.Federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives could require VITAS to expend substantial sums on acquiring, implementing and supporting new information systems, which could negatively impact its profitability.There are currently numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives at both the state and federal levels that address patient privacy concerns.  We cannot predict the total financial or other impact of the regulations on VITAS’ operations.  In addition, although VITAS’ management believes it is in compliance with the requirement of patient privacy regulations, we cannot assure you that VITAS will not be found to have violated state and federal laws, rules or guidelines surrounding patient privacy.  Compliance with current and future HIPAA and HITECH requirements or any other federal or state privacy initiatives could require VITAS to make substantial investments, which could negatively impact its profitability and cash flows.VITAS’ growth strategies may not be successful, which could adversely affect its business.A significant element of VITAS’ growth strategy is expected to include expansion of its business in new and existing markets.  This aspect of VITAS’ growth strategy may not be successful, which could adversely impact its growth and profitability.  We cannot assure you that VITAS will be able to:·Identify markets that meet its selection criteria for new hospice locations;·Hire and retain qualified management teams to operate each of its new hospice locations;·Manage a large and geographically diverse group of hospice locations;·Become Medicare and Medicaid certified in new markets;·Generate sufficient hospice admissions to operate profitably in these new markets;·Compete effectively with existing hospices in new markets; or·Obtain state licensure and/or a certificate of need from appropriate state agencies in new markets. 17 VITAS’ loss of key management personnel or its inability to hire and retain skilled employees could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.VITAS’ future success significantly depends upon the continued service of its senior management personnel.  The loss of one or more of VITAS’ key senior management personnel or its inability to hire and retain new skilled employees could negatively impact VITAS’ ability to maintain or increase patient referrals, a key aspect of its growth strategy, and could adversely affect its future operating results.Competition for skilled employees is intense, and the process of locating and recruiting skilled employees with the combination of qualifications and attributes required to care effectively for terminally ill patients and their families can be difficult and lengthy.  We cannot assure you that VITAS will be successful in attracting, retaining or training highly skilled nursing, management, community education, operations, admissions and other personnel.  VITAS’ business could be disrupted and its growth and profitability negatively impacted if it is unable to attract and retain skilled employees.A nationwide shortage of qualified nurses could adversely affect VITAS’ profitability, growth and ability to continue to provide quality, responsive hospice services to its patients as nursing wages and benefits increase.Approximately 40% of VITAS’ workforce is licensed nurses.  VITAS depends on qualified nurses to provide quality, responsive hospice services to its patients.  The current nationwide shortage of qualified nurses impacts some of the markets in which VITAS provides hospice services.  In response to this shortage, VITAS has adjusted its wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and to engage contract nurses.  VITAS’ inability to attract and retain qualified nurses could adversely affect its ability to provide quality, responsive hospice services to its patients and its ability to increase or maintain patient census in those markets.  Increases in the wages and benefits required to attract and retain qualified nurses or an increase in reliance on contract nurses could negatively impact profitability.VITAS may not be able to compete successfully against other hospice providers, and competitive pressures may limit its ability to maintain or increase its market position and adversely affect its profitability, financial condition and results of operations.Hospice care in the United States is highly competitive.  In many areas in which VITAS’ hospices are located, they compete with a large number of organizations, including:·Community-based hospice providers;·National and regional companies;·Hospital-based hospice and palliative care programs;·Physician groups;·Nursing homes;·Home health agencies;·Infusion therapy companies; and·Nursing agencies.Various health care companies have diversified into the hospice industry.  Other companies, including hospitals and health care organizations that are not currently providing hospice care, may enter the markets VITAS serves and expand the variety of services offered to include hospice care.  We cannot assure you that VITAS will not encounter increased competition in the future that could limit its ability to maintain or increase its market position, including competition from parties in a position to impact referrals to VITAS.  Such increased competition could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business, financial condition and results of operations. 18 Changes in rates or methods of payment for VITAS’ services could adversely affect its revenues and profits.Managed care organizations have grown substantially in terms of the percentage of the population they cover and their control over an increasing portion of the health care economy.  Managed care organizations have continued to consolidate to enhance their ability to influence the delivery of health care services and to exert pressure to control health care costs.  VITAS has a number of contractual arrangements with managed care organizations and other similar parties.VITAS provides hospice care to many Medicare beneficiaries who have elected Medicare managed care.  Under such contracts between HMOs and the federal Department of Health and Human Services, the Medicare payments for hospice services are excluded from the per-member, per-month payment from Medicare to HMOs and instead are paid directly by Medicare to the hospices.  As a result, VITAS’ payments for Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare risk HMOs are processed in the same way with the same rates as other Medicare beneficiaries.  We cannot assure, however, that payment for hospice services will continue to be excluded from HMO payment under Medicare risk contracts and similar Medicare managed care plans or that if not excluded, managed care organizations or other large third-party payors would not use their power to influence and exert pressure on health care providers to reduce costs in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business, financial condition and results of operations.Liability claims may have an adverse effect on VITAS, and its insurance coverage may be inadequate.Participants in the hospice industry are subject to lawsuits alleging negligence, product liability or other similar legal theories, many of which involve large claims and significant defense costs.  From time to time, VITAS is subject to such and other types of lawsuits.  See the description below under Legal Proceedings.  The ultimate liability for claims, if any, could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or operating results.  Although VITAS currently maintains liability insurance intended to cover the claims, we cannot assure you that the coverage limits of such insurance policies will be adequate or that all such claims will be covered by the insurance.  In addition, VITAS’ insurance policies must be renewed annually and may be subject to cancellation during the policy period.  While VITAS has been able to obtain liability insurance in the past, such insurance varies in cost, and may not be available in the future on terms acceptable to VITAS, if at all.A successful claim in excess of the insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on VITAS.  Claims, regardless of their merit or eventual outcome, also may have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business and reputation due to the costs of litigation, diversion of management’s time and related publicity.VITAS procures professional liability coverage on a claims-made basis.  The insurance contracts specify that coverage is available only during the term of each insurance contract.  VITAS’ management intends to renew or replace the existing claims-made policy annually but such coverage is difficult to obtain, may be subject to cancellation and may be written by carriers that are unable, or unwilling to pay claims Additionally, some risks and liabilities, including claims for punitive damages, are not covered by insurance.CybersecurityIn the normal course of business, our information technology systems hold sensitive patient information including patient demographic data, eligibility for various medical plans including Medicare and Medicaid and protected health information.  Additionally, we utilize those same systems to perform our day-to-day activities, such as receiving referrals, assigning medical teams to patients, documenting medical information and maintaining an accurate record of all transactions.  We have not experienced any known attacks on our information technology systems that have compromised patient data or the Company’s proprietary data.  We maintain our information technology systems with safeguard protection against cyber-attacks including active intrusion protection, firewalls and virus detection software.  As discussed previously, we are subject to and comply with HIPPA and HITECH regulations.  We have developed and tested a response plan in the event of a successful attack and we maintain commercial insurance related to a cyber-attack. However, these safeguards do not ensure that a significant cyber-attack could not occur.  A successful attack on our information technology systems could have significant consequences to the business including liability for compromised patient information and business interruption.VITAS’ success is highly dependent on its brand reputationVITAS’ reputation for performing quality routine and high acuity patient hospice care within the regulations mandated by Medicare, Medicaid and commercial payors is critical to our success.  Failure to provide quality patient care within the regulations mandated by our third-party payors, or the perception of inappropriate care resulting in adverse publicity, litigation or a campaign of negative on-line reviews are some of the factors that could negatively impact VITAS’ national reputation.  VITAS maintains a reputation management risk program however, a loss of brand reputation at VITAS could adversely affect referral sources’ willingness to refer our service and thus, adversely affect our future operating performance. 19 VITAS’ headquarters and a significant portion of its operations are in south FloridaThe occurrence of a natural disaster in any region that VITAS has significant operations could have a negative impact on the business.  VITAS’ headquarters are located in Miami, Florida.  In addition, two of our largest programs are in south Florida.  The location of our headquarters and these large programs increases our exposure to hurricanes.  A major hurricane in south Florida could impede our ability to bill for our services, operate our businesses and serve our patients’ in the affected area.  VITAS maintains a disaster recovery program to mitigate this risk however, natural disasters could have an adverse effect on our future operating performance"
13,CHE,CHEMED CORP,2016-02-26,"  Risk Factors
You should carefully consider the risks described below.  They are not the only ones facing the Company.  Other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.GENERALWe have incurred debt to finance the operations of the Company. The Company has debt service obligations that may restrict our operating flexibility.  We cannot assure you that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to service our debt, which may require us to borrow additional funds, or restructure or otherwise refinance our debt.  In addition, the Company has the ability to expand its debt and borrowing capacity subject to various restrictions and covenants defined by its creditors.  The interest rate the Company pays will fluctuate from time to time based upon a number of factors including current LIBOR rates and Company operating performance.  Significant changes in these factors could result in a material change in the Company’s interest expense. Our ability to repay or to refinance our indebtedness and to pay interest on our indebtedness will depend on our operating performance, which may be affected by factors beyond our control.  These factors could include operating difficulties, increased operating costs, our competitors’ actions and regulatory developments.  Our ability to meet our debt service and other obligations may depend in significant part on the extent to which we successfully implement our business strategy.  We cannot assure you that we will be able to implement our strategy fully or that the anticipated results of our strategy will be realized.  Credit market conditions may make it difficult for us to obtain new financing or refinance our current debt on terms and conditions acceptable to us. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional equity capital or restructure our debt.  We cannot assure you that our cash flows and capital resources will be sufficient to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness in the future or that alternative measures would successfully meet our debt service obligations.The agreements and instruments governing our outstanding debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business and adversely affect the price of our Capital Stock. The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our instruments of indebtedness restrict our ability to incur additional debt; issue and sell capital stock of subsidiaries; sell assets; engage in transactions with affiliates; restrict distributions from subsidiaries; incur liens; engage in business other than permitted businesses; engage in sale/leaseback transactions; engage in mergers or consolidations; make capital expenditures; make guarantees; make investments and acquisitions; enter into operating leases; hedge interest rates; and prepay other debt.   11   Moreover, if we are unable to meet the terms of the financial covenants or if we breach any of these covenants, a default could result under one or more of these agreements.  A default, if not waived by our lenders, could accelerate repayment of our outstanding indebtedness.  If acceleration occurs, we may not be able to repay our debt and it is unlikely that we would be able to borrow sufficient additional funds to refinance such debt on acceptable terms.  In the event of any default under our credit facilities, the lenders thereunder could elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, to be due and payable, and to require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings, any of which would be an event of default.We depend on our management team and the loss of their service could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of our executive management team.  The loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract or retain other skilled personnel in the future.Environmental compliance costs and liabilities could increase our expenses and adversely affect our financial condition. Our operations are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that prohibit or restrict the discharge of pollutants into the environment and regulate employee exposure to hazardous substance in the workplace.  Failure to comply with these laws could subject us to material costs and liabilities, including civil and criminal fines, costs to cleanup contamination we cause and, in some circumstances, costs to cleanup contamination we discover on our own property but did not cause.Because we use and generate hazardous materials in some of our operations, we are potentially subject to material liabilities relating to the cleanup of contamination and personal injury claims.  In addition, we have retained certain environmental liabilities in connection with the sale of former businesses.  We are currently funding the cleanup of historical contamination at one of our former properties and contributing to the cleanup of third-party sites as a result of our sale of our former subsidiary DuBois Chemicals Inc.  Although we have established a reserve for these liabilities, actual cleanup costs may exceed our current estimates due to factors beyond our control, such as the discovery of additional contamination or the enforcement of more stringent cleanup requirements.  New laws and regulations or their stricter enforcement, the discovery of presently unknown conditions or the receipt of additional claims for indemnification could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities including impairment of our brand that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to certain anti-takeover statutes that might make it more difficult to effect a change in control of the Company. We are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits us from engaging in a “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.  The application of Section 203 could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control that could be advantageous to stockholders.An adverse ruling against us in certain litigation could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We are involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of our business currently and from time to time.  The damages claimed against us in some of these cases are substantial.  See the “Legal Proceedings” sections of this 10-K for discussion of particular matters. We cannot assure you that we will prevail in pending cases.  Regardless of the outcome, such litigation is costly to manage, investigate and defend, and the related defense costs, diversion of management’s time and related publicity may adversely affect the conduct of our business and the results of our operations.  12  ROTO-ROOTERWe face intense competition from numerous, fragmented competitors.  If we do not compete effectively, our business may suffer. We face intense competition from numerous competitors.  The sewer, drain and pipe cleaning, excavation, plumbing repair and water restoration businesses are highly fragmented, with the bulk of the industries consisting of local and regional competitors.  We compete primarily on the basis of advertising, range of services provided, name recognition, availability of emergency service, speed and quality of customer service, service guarantees and pricing.  Our competitors may succeed in developing new or enhanced products and services more successful than ours and in marketing and selling existing and new products and services better than we do.  In addition, new competitors may emerge.  We cannot make any assurances that we will continue to be able to compete successfully with any of these companies.Our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations, exposing us to potential claims and compliance costs that could adversely affect our business. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to franchising, insurance and other aspects of our business.  These are discussed in greater detail under “Government Regulations” in the Description of Business section hereof.  If we fail to comply with existing or future laws and regulations, we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines and sanctions.  Our franchising activities are subject to various federal and state franchising laws and regulations, including the rules and regulations of the FTC regarding the offering or sale of franchises.  These rules and regulations require us to provide all of our prospective franchisees with specific information regarding us and our franchise program in the form of a detailed franchise offering circular.  In addition, a number of states require us to register our franchise offering prior to offering or selling franchises in such states.  Various state laws also provide for certain rights in favor of franchisees, including (i) limitations on the franchisor’s ability to terminate a franchise except for good cause, (ii) restrictions on the franchisor’s ability to deny renewal of a franchise, (iii) circumstances under which the franchisor may be required to purchase certain inventory of franchisees when a franchise is terminated or not renewed in violation of such laws and (iv) provisions relating to arbitration.  The ability to engage in the plumbing repair business is also subject to certain limitations and restrictions imposed by the state and local licensing laws and regulations.   We cannot predict what legislation or regulations affecting our business will be enacted in the future, how existing or future laws or regulations will be enforced, administered and interpreted, or the amount of future expenditures that may be required to comply with these laws or regulations.  Compliance costs associated with governmental regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Roto-Rooter’s loss of key management personnel or its inability to hire and retain skilled employees could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. Roto-Rooter’s future success significantly depends upon the continued service of its senior management personnel.  The loss of one or more of Roto-Rooter’s key senior management personnel or its inability to hire and retain new skilled employees could negatively impact its ability to maintain or increase customer calls and jobs, a key aspect of its growth strategy, and could adversely affect its future operating results. Competition for skilled employees, particularly licensed plumbers, is intense, and the process of locating and recruiting skilled employees with the combination of qualifications and attributes required to adequately perform plumbing duties can be difficult and lengthy.  We cannot assure you that Roto-Rooter will be successful in attracting, retaining or training highly skilled personnel.  Roto-Rooter’s business could be disrupted and its growth and profitability negatively impacted if it is unable to attract and retain skilled employees.Cybersecurity In the normal course of business, our information technology systems hold sensitive customer information including names, addresses and partial credit card information.  Additionally, we utilize those same systems to perform our day-to-day activities, such as receiving customer calls, dispatching technicians to jobs and maintaining an accurate record of all transactions.  We have not experienced any known attacks on our information technology systems that compromised customer data or the Company’s proprietary data.  We maintain our information technology systems with safeguard protection against cyber-attacks including intrusion detection and protection services, firewalls and virus detection software.  Additionally, on a quarterly basis, we test our information technology systems using cyber-attack software and methods to learn how a successful attack may be made.  We remedy any issues encountered during these tests.  However, these safeguards do not ensure that a significant cyber-attack could not occur.  A successful attack on our information technology systems could have significant consequences to the business including liability for compromised customer information and business interruption.  13   Roto-Rooter’s success is highly dependent on its brand reputation Roto-Rooter’s national reputation and brand image for performing necessary, high quality services in a timely manner is critical to Roto-Rooter’s continued success.  Adverse publicity, litigation or on-line negative reviews focused on the Roto-Rooter brand could negatively impact Roto-Rooter’s national reputation resulting in decreased future demand for Roto-Rooter branded services.  Roto-Rooter maintains a reputation management risk program, however, a loss of brand reputation at Roto-Rooter could adversely affect consumer willingness to use our service and thus, adversely affect our future operating performance.VITASVITAS is highly dependent on payments from Medicare and Medicaid.  If there are changes in the rate or methods governing these payments, VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profits could materially decline. In excess of 95% of VITAS’ net patient service revenue consists of payments from the Medicare and Medicaid programs.  Such payments are made primarily on a “per diem” basis, subject to annual reimbursement caps.  Because VITAS receives a per diem fee to provide eligible services to all patients, VITAS’ profitability is largely dependent upon its ability to manage the costs of providing hospice services to patients.  Increases in operating costs, such as labor and supply costs that are subject to inflation, without a compensating increase in Medicare and Medicaid rates, could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business in the future.  Medicare and Medicaid currently adjust the various hospice payment rates annually based primarily on the increase or decrease of the hospital wage index basket, regionally adjusted.  However, the increases may be less than actual inflation.  VITAS’ profitability could be negatively impacted if this adjustment were eliminated or reduced, or if VITAS’ costs of providing hospice services increased more than the annual adjustment.  In addition, cost pressures resulting from shorter patient lengths of stay and the use of more expensive forms of palliative care, including drugs and drug delivery systems, could negatively impact VITAS’ profitability.  Many payors are increasing pressure to control health care costs.  In addition, both public and private payors are increasing pressure to decrease, or limit increases in, reimbursement rates for health care services.  VITAS’ levels of revenue and profitability will be subject to the effect of possible reductions in coverage or payment rates by third-party payors, including payment rates from Medicare and Medicaid. Each state that maintains a Medicaid program has the option to provide reimbursement for hospice services at reimbursement rates generally required to be at least as much as Medicare rates.  All states in which VITAS operates cover Medicaid hospice services; however, we cannot assure you that the states in which VITAS is presently operating or states into which VITAS could expand operations will continue to cover Medicaid hospice services.  In addition, the Medicare and Medicaid programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive and prospective rate and payment adjustments, administrative rulings, freezes and funding reductions, all of which may adversely affect the level of program payments and could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business.  We cannot assure that Medicare and/or Medicaid payments to hospices will not decrease.  Reductions in amounts paid by government programs for services or changes in methods or regulations governing payments could cause VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profits to materially decline.Approximately 20% of VITAS’ days of care are provided to patients who reside in nursing homes. Changes in the laws and regulations regarding payments for hospice services and “room and board” provided to VITAS’ hospice patients residing in nursing homes could reduce its net patient service revenue and profitability.For VITAS’ hospice patients receiving nursing home care under certain state Medicaid programs who elect hospice care under Medicare and Medicaid, the state generally must pay VITAS, in addition to the applicable Medicare or Medicaid hospice per diem rate, an amount equal to at least 95% of the Medicaid per diem nursing home rate for “room and board” furnished to the patient by the nursing home.  VITAS contracts with various nursing homes for the nursing homes’ provision of certain “room and board” services that the nursing homes would otherwise provide Medicaid nursing home patients.  VITAS bills and collects from the applicable state Medicaid program an amount equal to approximately 95% of the amount that would otherwise have been paid directly to the nursing home under the state’s Medicaid plan.  Under VITAS’ standard nursing home contracts, it pays the nursing home for these “room and board” services at approximately 100% of the Medicaid per diem nursing home rate. The reduction or elimination of Medicare and Medicaid payments for hospice patients residing in nursing homes would reduce VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profitability.  In addition, changes in the way nursing homes are reimbursed for “room and board” services provided to hospice patients residing in nursing homes could affect VITAS’ ability to serve patients in nursing homes.   14   If VITAS is unable to maintain relationships with existing patient referral sources or to establish new referral sources, VITAS’ growth and profitability could be adversely affected. VITAS’ success is heavily dependent on referrals from physicians, long-term care facilities, hospitals and other institutional health care providers, managed care companies, insurance companies and other patient referral sources in the communities that its hospice locations serve, as well as on its ability to maintain good relations with these referral sources.  VITAS’ referral sources may refer their patients to other hospice care providers or not to a hospice provider at all.  VITAS’ growth and profitability depend significantly on its ability to establish and maintain close working relationships with these patient referral sources and to increase awareness and acceptance of hospice care by its referral sources and their patients.  We cannot assure that VITAS will be able to maintain its existing relationships or that it will be able to develop and maintain new relationships in existing or new markets.  VITAS’ loss of existing relationships or its failure to develop new relationships could adversely affect its ability to expand or maintain its operations and operate profitably.  Moreover, we cannot assure you that awareness or acceptance of hospice care will increase or remain at current levels.VITAS operates in an industry that is subject to extensive government regulation and claims reviews, and changes in law and regulatory interpretations could reduce its net patient service revenue and profitability and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. The healthcare industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations relating to, among others: ●    Payment for services; ●    Conduct of operations, including fraud and abuse, anti-kickback prohibitions, self-referral prohibitions and false claims; ●    Privacy and security of medical records; ●    Employment practices; and ●    Various state approval requirements, such as facility and professional licensure, certificate of need, compliance surveys and other certification or recertification requirements.Changes in these laws, rules and regulations or in interpretations thereof could reduce VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profitability.  VITAS’ ability to comply with such regulations is a key factor in determining the success of its business.  See the “Government Regulations” section of this 10-K for a greater description of these matters. Fraud and Abuse Laws.  VITAS contracts with a significant number of health care providers and practitioners, including physicians, hospitals and nursing homes and arranges for these entities to provide services to VITAS’ patients.  Some of these health care providers and practitioners may refer, or be in a position to refer, patients to VITAS (or VITAS may refer patients to them).  These arrangements may not qualify for a safe harbor.  VITAS from time to time seeks guidance from regulatory counsel as to the changing and evolving interpretations and the potential applicability of the Anti-Kickback Law to its programs, and in response thereto, takes such actions as it deems appropriate.  VITAS generally believes that its contracts and arrangements with providers, practitioners and suppliers should not be found to violate the Anti-Kickback Law.  However, we cannot assure you that such laws will ultimately be interpreted in a manner consistent with VITAS’ practices. Several health care reform proposals have included an expansion of the Anti-Kickback Law to include referrals of any patients regardless of payor source, which is similar to the scope of certain laws that have been enacted at the state level.  In addition, a number of states in which VITAS operates have laws, which vary from state to state, prohibiting certain direct or indirect remuneration or fee-splitting arrangements between health care providers, regardless of payor source, for the referral of patients to a particular provider. The federal Ethics in Patient Referral Act, Section 1877 of the Social Security Act (commonly known as the “Stark Law”) prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients for “designated health services” to entities in which they hold an ownership or investment interest or with whom they have a compensation arrangement, subject to certain statutory or regulatory exceptions.  We cannot assure you that future statutory or regulatory changes will not result in hospice services being subject to the Stark Law’s ownership, investment, compensation or referral prohibitions.  Several states in which VITAS operates have similar laws which likewise are subject to change.  Any such changes could adversely affect the business, financial condition and operating results of VITAS.  15   Further, under separate statutes, submission of claims for items or services that are “not provided as claimed” may lead to civil money penalties, criminal fines and imprisonment and/or exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federally funded state health care programs.  These false claims statutes include the federal False Claims Act, which allows any person to bring suit on behalf of the federal government, known as a qui tam action, alleging false or fraudulent Medicare or Medicaid claims or other violations of the statute and to share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement.  See the discussion of the governmental investigations and litigation pending against VITAS under Other Healthcare Regulations, above and Legal Proceedings, below.Certificate of Need Laws.  Many states, including Florida, have certificate of need laws or other similar health planning laws that apply to hospice care providers.  These states may require some form of state agency review or approval prior to opening a new hospice program, to adding or expanding hospice services, to undertaking significant capital expenditures or under other specified circumstances.  Approval under these certificate of need laws is generally conditioned on the showing of a demonstrable need for services in the community.  VITAS may seek to develop, acquire or expand hospice programs in states having certificate of need laws.  To the extent that state agencies require VITAS to obtain a certificate of need or other similar approvals to expand services at existing hospice programs or to make acquisitions or develop hospice programs in new or existing geographical markets, VITAS’ plans could be adversely affected by a failure to obtain a certificate or approval.  In addition, competitors may seek administratively or judicially to challenge such an approval or proposed approval by the state agency.  Such a challenge, whether or not ultimately successful, could adversely affect VITAS. Other Federal and State Regulations. The federal government and all states regulate various aspects of the hospice industry and VITAS’ business.  In particular, VITAS’ operations are subject to federal and state health regulatory laws, including those covering professional services, the dispensing of drugs and certain types of hospice activities.  Certain of VITAS’ employees are subject to state laws and regulations governing professional practice.  VITAS’ operations are subject to periodic survey by governmental authorities and private accrediting entities to assure compliance with applicable state licensing, and Medicare and Medicaid certification and accreditation standards, as the case may be.  From time to time in the ordinary course of business, VITAS receives survey reports noting deficiencies for alleged failure to comply with applicable requirements.  VITAS reviews such reports and takes appropriate corrective action.  The failure to effect such action could result in one of VITAS’ hospice programs being terminated from the Medicare hospice program.  Any termination of one or more of VITAS’ hospice locations from the Medicare hospice program could adversely affect VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profitability and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.   The failure to obtain, renew or maintain any of the required regulatory approvals, certifications or licenses could materially adversely affect VITAS’ business and could prevent the programs involved from offering products and services to patients.  In addition, laws and regulations often are adopted to regulate new products, services and industries.  We cannot assure you that either the states or the federal government will not impose additional regulations on VITAS’ activities, which might materially adversely affect VITAS, including impairing the value of its brand. Claims Review.  The Medicare and Medicaid programs and their fiscal intermediaries and other payors periodically conduct pre-payment or post-payment reviews and other reviews and audits of health care claims, including hospice claims.  As a result of such reviews or audits, VITAS could be required to return any amounts found to be overpaid, or amounts found to be overpaid could be recouped through reductions in future payments.  There is pressure from state and federal governments and other payors to scrutinize health care claims to determine their validity and appropriateness.  VITAS’ claims have been subject to review and audit.  We cannot assure you that reviews and/or similar audits of VITAS’ claims will not result in material recoupments, denials or other actions that could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business, financial condition and results of operations.  See the discussion of OIG investigations pending against VITAS under Other Health Care Regulations, above. Regulation and Provision of Continuous Home Care.  VITAS provides continuous home care to patients requiring such care.  Continuous home care is provided to allow the patient to remain in their home, during periods of crisis when intensive monitoring and care, primarily nursing care, is required in order to achieve palliation or management of acute medical symptoms.  Continuous home care requires a minimum of 8 hours of care within a 24-hour day, which begins and ends at midnight.  The care must be predominantly nursing care provided by either a registered nurse or licensed practical nurse. Continuous home care can be challenging for a hospice to provide for a number of reasons, including the need to have available sufficient skilled and trained staff to furnish such care, the need to manage the staffing and provision of such care, and a shortage of nurses that can make it particularly difficult to attract and retain nurses that are required to furnish a majority of such care.  Medicare reimbursement for continuous home care has been calculated by multiplying the applicable continuous home care hourly rate by the number of hours of care provided.  If the care was provided for less than one hour, Medicare requires reporting in 15-minute increments of care provided, with no rounding.   16   Medicare reimbursement for continuous home care is subject to a number of requirements posing further challenges for a hospice providing such care.  For example, if a patient requires skilled interventions for palliation or symptom management that can be accomplished in less than 8 aggregate hours within the 24-hour period, if the majority of care can be accomplished by someone other than a registered nurse or a licensed practical nurse (e.g., if a majority of care is furnished by a home health aide or homemaker), or if for any reason less than 8 hours of direct care are provided (such as when a patient dies before 8 AM even if 7 or more hours of care has been provided), the care rendered cannot be reimbursed by Medicare at the continuous home care rate (although the care instead may be eligible for Medicare reimbursement at the reduced routine home care day rate).  As a result of such requirements, VITAS may incur the costs of providing services intended to be continuous home care services yet be unable to bill or be reimbursed for such services at the continuous home care rate.  We cannot assure you that challenges in providing continuous home care will not cause VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profits to materially decline or that reviews and/or similar audits of VITAS’ claims will not result in material recoupments, denials or other actions that could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business, financial condition and results of operations. Compliance.  VITAS maintains an internal regulatory compliance review program and from time to time retains regulatory counsel for guidance on compliance matters.  We cannot assure you, however, that VITAS’ practices, if reviewed, would be found to be in compliance with applicable health regulatory laws, as such laws ultimately may be interpreted, or that any non-compliance with such laws would not have a material adverse effect on VITAS.Federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives could require VITAS to expend substantial sums on acquiring, implementing and supporting new information systems, which could negatively impact its profitability. There are currently numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives at both the state and federal levels that address patient privacy concerns.  We cannot predict the total financial or other impact of the regulations on VITAS’ operations.  In addition, although VITAS’ management believes it is in compliance with the requirement of patient privacy regulations, we cannot assure you that VITAS will not be found to have violated state and federal laws, rules or guidelines surrounding patient privacy.  Compliance with current and future HIPAA and HITECH requirements or any other federal or state privacy initiatives could require VITAS to make substantial investments, which could negatively impact its profitability and cash flows.VITAS’ growth strategies may not be successful, which could adversely affect its business. A significant element of VITAS’ growth strategy is expected to include expansion of its business in new and existing markets.  This aspect of VITAS’ growth strategy may not be successful, which could adversely impact its growth and profitability.  We cannot assure you that VITAS will be able to: ●     Identify markets that meet its selection criteria for new hospice locations; ●     Hire and retain qualified management teams to operate each of its new hospice locations;●     Manage a large and geographically diverse group of hospice locations;●     Become Medicare and Medicaid certified in new markets;●     Generate sufficient hospice admissions to operate profitably in these new markets;●     Compete effectively with existing hospices in new markets; or●     Obtain state licensure and/or a certificate of need from appropriate state agencies in new markets.VITAS’ loss of key management personnel or its inability to hire and retain skilled employees could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. VITAS’ future success significantly depends upon the continued service of its senior management personnel.  The loss of one or more of VITAS’ key senior management personnel or its inability to hire and retain new skilled employees could negatively impact VITAS’ ability to maintain or increase patient referrals, a key aspect of its growth strategy, and could adversely affect its future operating results.  17   Competition for skilled employees is intense, and the process of locating and recruiting skilled employees with the combination of qualifications and attributes required to care effectively for terminally ill patients and their families can be difficult and lengthy.  We cannot assure you that VITAS will be successful in attracting, retaining or training highly skilled nursing, management, community education, operations, admissions and other personnel.  VITAS’ business could be disrupted and its growth and profitability negatively impacted if it is unable to attract and retain skilled employees.A nationwide shortage of qualified nurses could adversely affect VITAS’ profitability, growth and ability to continue to provide quality, responsive hospice services to its patients as nursing wages and benefits increase. Approximately 40% of VITAS’ workforce is licensed nurses.  VITAS depends on qualified nurses to provide quality, responsive hospice services to its patients.  The current nationwide shortage of qualified nurses impacts some of the markets in which VITAS provides hospice services.  In response to this shortage, VITAS has adjusted its wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and to engage contract nurses.  VITAS’ inability to attract and retain qualified nurses could adversely affect its ability to provide quality, responsive hospice services to its patients and its ability to increase or maintain patient census in those markets.  Increases in the wages and benefits required to attract and retain qualified nurses or an increase in reliance on contract nurses could negatively impact profitability.VITAS may not be able to compete successfully against other hospice providers, and competitive pressures may limit its ability to maintain or increase its market position and adversely affect its profitability, financial condition and results of operations. Hospice care in the United States is highly competitive.  In many areas in which VITAS’ hospices are located, they compete with a large number of organizations, including: ●   Community-based hospice providers;●   National and regional companies; ●   Hospital-based hospice and palliative care programs;●   Physician groups;●   Nursing homes;●   Home health agencies; ●   Infusion therapy companies; and ●  Nursing agencies. Various health care companies have diversified into the hospice industry.  Other companies, including hospitals and health care organizations that are not currently providing hospice care, may enter the markets VITAS serves and expand the variety of services offered to include hospice care.  We cannot assure you that VITAS will not encounter increased competition in the future that could limit its ability to maintain or increase its market position, including competition from parties in a position to impact referrals to VITAS.  Such increased competition could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business, financial condition and results of operations.Changes in rates or methods of payment for VITAS’ services could adversely affect its revenues and profits. Managed care organizations have grown substantially in terms of the percentage of the population they cover and their control over an increasing portion of the health care economy.  Managed care organizations have continued to consolidate to enhance their ability to influence the delivery of health care services and to exert pressure to control health care costs.  VITAS has a number of contractual arrangements with managed care organizations and other similar parties. VITAS provides hospice care to many Medicare beneficiaries who receive their non-hospice health care services from health maintenance organizations (“HMOs”) under Medicare risk contracts.  Under such contracts between HMOs and the federal Department of Health and Human Services, the Medicare payments for hospice services are excluded from the per-member, per-month payment from Medicare to HMOs and instead are paid directly by Medicare to the hospices.  As a result, VITAS’ payments for Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare risk HMOs are processed in the same way with the same rates as other Medicare beneficiaries.  We cannot assure, however, that payment for hospice services will continue to be excluded from HMO payment under Medicare risk contracts and similar Medicare managed care plans or that if not excluded, managed care organizations or other large third-party payors would not use their power to influence and exert pressure on health care providers to reduce costs in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business, financial condition and results of operations.  18   Liability claims may have an adverse effect on VITAS, and its insurance coverage may be inadequate. Participants in the hospice industry are subject to lawsuits alleging negligence, product liability or other similar legal theories, many of which involve large claims and significant defense costs.  From time to time, VITAS is subject to such and other types of lawsuits.  See the description below under Legal Proceedings.  The ultimate liability for claims, if any, could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or operating results.  Although VITAS currently maintains liability insurance intended to cover the claims, we cannot assure you that the coverage limits of such insurance policies will be adequate or that all such claims will be covered by the insurance.  In addition, VITAS’ insurance policies must be renewed annually and may be subject to cancellation during the policy period.  While VITAS has been able to obtain liability insurance in the past, such insurance varies in cost,  and may not be available in the future on terms acceptable to VITAS, if at all. A successful claim in excess of the insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on VITAS.  Claims, regardless of their merit or eventual outcome, also may have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business and reputation due to the costs of litigation, diversion of management’s time and related publicity. VITAS procures professional liability coverage on a claims-made basis.  The insurance contracts specify that coverage is available only during the term of each insurance contract.  VITAS’ management intends to renew or replace the existing claims-made policy annually but such coverage is difficult to obtain, may be subject to cancellation and may be written by carriers that are unable, or unwilling to pay claims Certain claims have been asserted where the coverage would be the responsibility of this prior carrier and/or other carriers that may not have the financial wherewithal to satisfy the claims.  Additionally, some risks and liabilities, including claims for punitive damages, are not covered by insurance.CybersecurityIn the normal course of business, our information technology systems hold sensitive patient information including patient demographic data, eligibility for various medical plans including Medicare and Medicaid and protected health information.  Additionally, we utilize those same systems to perform our day-to-day activities, such as receiving referrals, assigning medical teams to patients, documenting medical information and maintaining an accurate record of all transactions.  We have not experienced any known attacks on our information technology systems that have compromised patient data or the Company’s proprietary data.  We maintain our information technology systems with safeguard protection against cyber-attacks including active intrusion protection, firewalls and virus detection software.  As discussed previously, we are subject to and comply with HIPPA and HITECH regulations.  However, these safeguards do not ensure that a significant cyber-attack could not occur.  A successful attack on our information technology systems could have significant consequences to the business including liability for compromised patient information and business interruption.VITAS’ success is highly dependent on its brand reputationVITAS’ reputation for performing quality routine and high acuity patient hospice care within the regulations mandated by Medicare, Medicaid and commercial payors is critical to our success.  Failure to provide quality patient care within the regulations mandated by our third-party payors, or the perception of inappropriate care resulting in adverse publicity, litigation or a campaign of negative on-line reviews are some of the factors that could negatively impact VITAS’ national reputation.  VITAS maintains a reputation management risk program however, a loss of brand reputation at VITAS could adversely affect referral sources’ willingness to refer our service and thus, adversely affect our future operating performance.VITAS’ headquarters and a significant portion of its operations are in south Florida The occurrence of a natural disaster in any region that VITAS has significant operations could have a negative impact on the business.  VITAS’ headquarters are located in Miami, Florida.  In addition, two of our largest programs are in south Florida.  The location of our headquarters and these large programs increases our exposure to hurricanes.  A major hurricane in south Florida could impede our ability to bill for our services, operate our businesses and serve our patients’ in the affected area.  VITAS maintains a disaster recovery program to mitigate this risk however, natural disasters could have an adverse affect on our future operating performance.   19

15,CHE,CHEMED CORP,2015-02-27,"  Risk Factors
You should carefully consider the risks described below.  They are not the only ones facing the Company.  Other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.GENERALWe have incurred debt to finance the operations of the Company.The Company has debt service obligations that may restrict our operating flexibility.  We cannot assure you that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to service our debt, which may require us to borrow additional funds, or restructure or otherwise refinance our debt.  In addition, the Company has the ability to expand its debt and borrowing capacity subject to various restrictions and covenants defined by its creditors.  The interest rate the Company pays will fluctuate from time to time based upon a number of factors including current LIBOR rates and Company operating performance.  Significant changes in these factors could result in a material change in the Company’s interest expense.Our ability to repay or to refinance our indebtedness and to pay interest on our indebtedness will depend on our operating performance, which may be affected by factors beyond our control.  These factors could include operating difficulties, increased operating costs, our competitors’ actions and regulatory developments.  Our ability to meet our debt service and other obligations may depend in significant part on the extent to which we successfully implement our business strategy.  We cannot assure you that we will be able to implement our strategy fully or that the anticipated results of our strategy will be realized.  Credit market conditions may make it difficult for us to obtain new financing or refinance our current debt on terms and conditions acceptable to us.If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional equity capital or restructure our debt.  We cannot assure you that our cash flows and capital resources will be sufficient to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness in the future or that alternative measures would successfully meet our debt service obligations.The agreements and instruments governing our outstanding debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business and adversely affect the price of our Capital Stock.The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our instruments of indebtedness restrict our ability to incur additional debt; issue and sell capital stock of subsidiaries; sell assets; engage in transactions with affiliates; restrict distributions from subsidiaries; incur liens; engage in business other than permitted businesses; engage in sale/leaseback transactions; engage in mergers or consolidations; make capital expenditures; make guarantees; make investments and acquisitions; enter into operating leases; hedge interest rates; and prepay other debt.Moreover, if we are unable to meet the terms of the financial covenants or if we breach any of these covenants, a default could result under one or more of these agreements.  A default, if not waived by our lenders, could accelerate repayment of our outstanding indebtedness.  If acceleration occurs, we may not be able to repay our debt and it is unlikely that we would be able to borrow sufficient additional funds to refinance such debt on acceptable terms.  In the event of any default under our credit facilities, the lenders thereunder could elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, to be due and payable, and to require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings, any of which would be an event of default.   12   We depend on our management team and the loss of their service could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of our executive management team.  The loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract or retain other skilled personnel in the future.Environmental compliance costs and liabilities could increase our expenses and adversely affect our financial condition.Our operations are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that prohibit or restrict the discharge of pollutants into the environment and regulate employee exposure to hazardous substance in the workplace.  Failure to comply with these laws could subject us to material costs and liabilities, including civil and criminal fines, costs to cleanup contamination we cause and, in some circumstances, costs to cleanup contamination we discover on our own property but did not cause.Because we use and generate hazardous materials in some of our operations, we are potentially subject to material liabilities relating to the cleanup of contamination and personal injury claims.  In addition, we have retained certain environmental liabilities in connection with the sale of former businesses.  We are currently funding the cleanup of historical contamination at one of our former properties and contributing to the cleanup of third-party sites as a result of our sale of our former subsidiary DuBois Chemicals Inc.  Although we have established a reserve for these liabilities, actual cleanup costs may exceed our current estimates due to factors beyond our control, such as the discovery of additional contamination or the enforcement of more stringent cleanup requirements.  New laws and regulations or their stricter enforcement, the discovery of presently unknown conditions or the receipt of additional claims for indemnification could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities including impairment of our brand that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to certain anti-takeover statutes that might make it more difficult to effect a change in control of the Company.We are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits us from engaging in a “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.  The application of Section 203 could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control that could be advantageous to stockholders.An adverse ruling against us in certain litigation could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.We are involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of our business currently and from time to time.  The damages claimed against us in some of these cases are substantial.  See the “Legal Proceedings” sections of this 10-K for discussion of particular matters. We cannot assure you that we will prevail in pending cases.  Regardless of the outcome, such litigation is costly to manage, investigate and defend, and the related defense costs, diversion of management’s time and related publicity may adversely affect the conduct of our business and the results of our operations.ROTO-ROOTERWe face intense competition from numerous, fragmented competitors.  If we do not compete effectively, our business may suffer.We face intense competition from numerous competitors.  The sewer, drain and pipe cleaning, excavation and plumbing repair businesses are highly fragmented, with the bulk of the industries consisting of local and regional competitors.  We compete primarily on the basis of advertising, range of services provided, name recognition, availability of emergency service, speed and quality of customer service, service guarantees and pricing.  Our competitors may succeed in developing new or enhanced products and services more successful than ours and in marketing and selling existing and new products and services better than we do.  In addition, new competitors may emerge.  We cannot make any assurances that we will continue to be able to compete successfully with any of these companies.   13   Our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations, exposing us to potential claims and compliance costs that could adversely affect our business.We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to franchising, insurance and other aspects of our business.  These are discussed in greater detail under “Government Regulations” in the Description of Business section hereof.  If we fail to comply with existing or future laws and regulations, we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines and sanctions.  Our franchising activities are subject to various federal and state franchising laws and regulations, including the rules and regulations of the FTC regarding the offering or sale of franchises.  These rules and regulations require us to provide all of our prospective franchisees with specific information regarding us and our franchise program in the form of a detailed franchise offering circular.  In addition, a number of states require us to register our franchise offering prior to offering or selling franchises in such states.  Various state laws also provide for certain rights in favor of franchisees, including (i) limitations on the franchisor’s ability to terminate a franchise except for good cause, (ii) restrictions on the franchisor’s ability to deny renewal of a franchise, (iii) circumstances under which the franchisor may be required to purchase certain inventory of franchisees when a franchise is terminated or not renewed in violation of such laws and (iv) provisions relating to arbitration.  The ability to engage in the plumbing repair business is also subject to certain limitations and restrictions imposed by the state and local licensing laws and regulations.   We cannot predict what legislation or regulations affecting our business will be enacted in the future, how existing or future laws or regulations will be enforced, administered and interpreted, or the amount of future expenditures that may be required to comply with these laws or regulations.  Compliance costs associated with governmental regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Roto-Rooter’s loss of key management personnel or its inability to hire and retain skilled employees could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.Roto-Rooter’s future success significantly depends upon the continued service of its senior management personnel.  The loss of one or more of Roto-Rooter’s key senior management personnel or its inability to hire and retain new skilled employees could negatively impact its ability to maintain or increase customer calls and jobs, a key aspect of its growth strategy, and could adversely affect its future operating results.Competition for skilled employees, particularly licensed plumbers, is intense, and the process of locating and recruiting skilled employees with the combination of qualifications and attributes required to adequately perform plumbing duties can be difficult and lengthy.  We cannot assure you that Roto-Rooter will be successful in attracting, retaining or training highly skilled personnel.  Roto-Rooter’s business could be disrupted and its growth and profitability negatively impacted if it is unable to attract and retain skilled employees.CybersecurityIn the normal course of business, our information technology systems hold sensitive customer information including names, addresses and partial credit card information.  Additionally, we utilize those same systems to perform our day-to-day activities, such as receiving customer calls, dispatching technicians to jobs and maintaining an accurate record of all transactions.  We have not experienced any known attacks on our information technology systems that compromised customer data or the Company’s proprietary data.  We maintain our information technology systems with safeguard protection against cyber-attacks including intrusion detection and protection services, firewalls and virus detection software.  Additionally, on a quarterly basis, we test our information technology systems using cyber-attack software and methods to learn how a successful attack may be made.  We remedy any issues encountered during these tests.  However, these safeguards do not ensure that a significant cyber-attack could not occur.  A successful attack on our information technology systems could have significant consequences to the business including liability for compromised customer information and business interruption.Roto-Rooter’s success is highly dependent on its brand reputationRoto-Rooter’s national reputation and brand image for performing necessary, high quality services in a timely manner is critical to Roto-Rooter’s continued success.  Adverse publicity, litigation or on-line negative reviews focused on the Roto-Rooter brand could negatively impact Roto-Rooter’s national reputation resulting in decreased future demand for Roto-Rooter branded services.  Roto-Rooter maintains a reputation management risk program, however, a loss of brand reputation at Roto-Rooter could adversely affect consumer willingness to use our service and thus, adversely affect our future operating performance. 14   VITASVITAS is highly dependent on payments from Medicare and Medicaid.  If there are changes in the rate or methods governing these payments, VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profits could materially decline.In excess of 90% of VITAS’ net patient service revenue consists of payments from the Medicare and Medicaid programs.  Such payments are made primarily on a “per diem” basis, subject to annual reimbursement caps.  Because VITAS receives a per diem fee to provide eligible services to all patients, VITAS’ profitability is largely dependent upon its ability to manage the costs of providing hospice services to patients.  Increases in operating costs, such as labor and supply costs that are subject to inflation, without a compensating increase in Medicare and Medicaid rates, could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business in the future.  Medicare and Medicaid currently adjust the various hospice payment rates annually based primarily on the increase or decrease of the hospital wage index basket, regionally adjusted.  However, the increases may be less than actual inflation.  VITAS’ profitability could be negatively impacted if this adjustment were eliminated or reduced, or if VITAS’ costs of providing hospice services increased more than the annual adjustment.  In addition, cost pressures resulting from shorter patient lengths of stay and the use of more expensive forms of palliative care, including drugs and drug delivery systems, could negatively impact VITAS’ profitability.  Many payors are increasing pressure to control health care costs.  In addition, both public and private payors are increasing pressure to decrease, or limit increases in, reimbursement rates for health care services.  VITAS’ levels of revenue and profitability will be subject to the effect of possible reductions in coverage or payment rates by third-party payors, including payment rates from Medicare and Medicaid.Each state that maintains a Medicaid program has the option to provide reimbursement for hospice services at reimbursement rates generally required to be at least as much as Medicare rates.  All states in which VITAS operates cover Medicaid hospice services; however, we cannot assure you that the states in which VITAS is presently operating or states into which VITAS could expand operations will continue to cover Medicaid hospice services.  In addition, the Medicare and Medicaid programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive and prospective rate and payment adjustments, administrative rulings, freezes and funding reductions, all of which may adversely affect the level of program payments and could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business.  We cannot assure that Medicare and/or Medicaid payments to hospices will not decrease.  Reductions in amounts paid by government programs for services or changes in methods or regulations governing payments could cause VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profits to materially decline.Approximately 20% of VITAS’ days of care are provided to patients who reside in nursing homes. Changes in the laws and regulations regarding payments for hospice services and “room and board” provided to VITAS’ hospice patients residing in nursing homes could reduce its net patient service revenue and profitability.For VITAS’ hospice patients receiving nursing home care under certain state Medicaid programs who elect hospice care under Medicare and Medicaid, the state generally must pay VITAS, in addition to the applicable Medicare or Medicaid hospice per diem rate, an amount equal to at least 95% of the Medicaid per diem nursing home rate for “room and board” furnished to the patient by the nursing home.  VITAS contracts with various nursing homes for the nursing homes’ provision of certain “room and board” services that the nursing homes would otherwise provide Medicaid nursing home patients.  VITAS bills and collects from the applicable state Medicaid program an amount equal to approximately 95% of the amount that would otherwise have been paid directly to the nursing home under the state’s Medicaid plan.  Under VITAS’ standard nursing home contracts, it pays the nursing home for these “room and board” services at approximately 100% of the Medicaid per diem nursing home rate.The reduction or elimination of Medicare and Medicaid payments for hospice patients residing in nursing homes would reduce VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profitability.  In addition, changes in the way nursing homes are reimbursed for “room and board” services provided to hospice patients residing in nursing homes could affect VITAS’ ability to serve patients in nursing homes.If VITAS is unable to maintain relationships with existing patient referral sources or to establish new referral sources, VITAS’ growth and profitability could be adversely affected.VITAS’ success is heavily dependent on referrals from physicians, long-term care facilities, hospitals and other institutional health care providers, managed care companies, insurance companies and other patient referral sources in the communities that its hospice locations serve, as well as on its ability to maintain good relations with these referral sources.  VITAS’ referral sources may refer their patients to other hospice care providers or not to a hospice provider at all.  VITAS’ growth and profitability depend significantly on its ability to establish and maintain close working relationships with these patient referral sources and to increase awareness and acceptance of hospice care by its referral sources and their patients.  We cannot assure that VITAS will be able to maintain its existing relationships or that it will be able to develop and maintain new relationships in existing or new markets.  VITAS’ loss of existing relationships or its failure to develop new relationships could adversely affect its ability to expand or maintain its operations and operate profitably.  Moreover, we cannot assure you that awareness or acceptance of hospice care will increase or remain at current levels.   15   VITAS operates in an industry that is subject to extensive government regulation and claims reviews, and changes in law and regulatory interpretations could reduce its net patient service revenue and profitability and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.The healthcare industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations relating to, among others:  ●Payment for services;      ●Conduct of operations, including fraud and abuse, anti-kickback prohibitions, self-referral prohibitions and false claims;      ●Privacy and security of medical records;      ●Employment practices; and      ●Various state approval requirements, such as facility and professional licensure, certificate of need, compliance surveys and other certification or recertification requirements.Changes in these laws, rules and regulations or in interpretations thereof could reduce VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profitability.  VITAS’ ability to comply with such regulations is a key factor in determining the success of its business.  See the “Government Regulations” section of this 10-K for a greater description of these matters.Fraud and Abuse Laws.  VITAS contracts with a significant number of health care providers and practitioners, including physicians, hospitals and nursing homes and arranges for these entities to provide services to VITAS’ patients.  Some of these health care providers and practitioners may refer, or be in a position to refer, patients to VITAS (or VITAS may refer patients to them).  These arrangements may not qualify for a safe harbor.  VITAS from time to time seeks guidance from regulatory counsel as to the changing and evolving interpretations and the potential applicability of the Anti-Kickback Law to its programs, and in response thereto, takes such actions as it deems appropriate.  VITAS generally believes that its contracts and arrangements with providers, practitioners and suppliers should not be found to violate the Anti-Kickback Law.  However, we cannot assure you that such laws will ultimately be interpreted in a manner consistent with VITAS’ practices.Several health care reform proposals have included an expansion of the Anti-Kickback Law to include referrals of any patients regardless of payor source, which is similar to the scope of certain laws that have been enacted at the state level.  In addition, a number of states in which VITAS operates have laws, which vary from state to state, prohibiting certain direct or indirect remuneration or fee-splitting arrangements between health care providers, regardless of payor source, for the referral of patients to a particular provider.The federal Ethics in Patient Referral Act, Section 1877 of the Social Security Act (commonly known as the “Stark Law”) prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients for “designated health services” to entities in which they hold an ownership or investment interest or with whom they have a compensation arrangement, subject to certain statutory or regulatory exceptions.  We cannot assure you that future statutory or regulatory changes will not result in hospice services being subject to the Stark Law’s ownership, investment, compensation or referral prohibitions.  Several states in which VITAS operates have similar laws which likewise are subject to change.  Any such changes could adversely affect the business, financial condition and operating results of VITAS.Further, under separate statutes, submission of claims for items or services that are “not provided as claimed” may lead to civil money penalties, criminal fines and imprisonment and/or exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federally funded state health care programs.  These false claims statutes include the federal False Claims Act, which allows any person to bring suit on behalf of the federal government, known as a qui tam action, alleging false or fraudulent Medicare or Medicaid claims or other violations of the statute and to share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement.  See the discussion of the governmental investigations and litigation pending against VITAS under Other Healthcare Regulations, above and Legal Proceedings, below.   16   Certificate of Need Laws.  Many states, including Florida, have certificate of need laws or other similar health planning laws that apply to hospice care providers.  These states may require some form of state agency review or approval prior to opening a new hospice program, to adding or expanding hospice services, to undertaking significant capital expenditures or under other specified circumstances.  Approval under these certificate of need laws is generally conditioned on the showing of a demonstrable need for services in the community.  VITAS may seek to develop, acquire or expand hospice programs in states having certificate of need laws.  To the extent that state agencies require VITAS to obtain a certificate of need or other similar approvals to expand services at existing hospice programs or to make acquisitions or develop hospice programs in new or existing geographical markets, VITAS’ plans could be adversely affected by a failure to obtain a certificate or approval.  In addition, competitors may seek administratively or judicially to challenge such an approval or proposed approval by the state agency.  Such a challenge, whether or not ultimately successful, could adversely affect VITAS.Other Federal and State Regulations. The federal government and all states regulate various aspects of the hospice industry and VITAS’ business.  In particular, VITAS’ operations are subject to federal and state health regulatory laws, including those covering professional services, the dispensing of drugs and certain types of hospice activities.  Certain of VITAS’ employees are subject to state laws and regulations governing professional practice.  VITAS’ operations are subject to periodic survey by governmental authorities and private accrediting entities to assure compliance with applicable state licensing, and Medicare and Medicaid certification and accreditation standards, as the case may be.  From time to time in the ordinary course of business, VITAS receives survey reports noting deficiencies for alleged failure to comply with applicable requirements.  VITAS reviews such reports and takes appropriate corrective action.  The failure to effect such action could result in one of VITAS’ hospice programs being terminated from the Medicare hospice program.  Any termination of one or more of VITAS’ hospice locations from the Medicare hospice program could adversely affect VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profitability and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.   The failure to obtain, renew or maintain any of the required regulatory approvals, certifications or licenses could materially adversely affect VITAS’ business and could prevent the programs involved from offering products and services to patients.  In addition, laws and regulations often are adopted to regulate new products, services and industries.  We cannot assure you that either the states or the federal government will not impose additional regulations on VITAS’ activities, which might materially adversely affect VITAS, including impairing the value of its brand.Claims Review.  The Medicare and Medicaid programs and their fiscal intermediaries and other payors periodically conduct pre-payment or post-payment reviews and other reviews and audits of health care claims, including hospice claims.  As a result of such reviews or audits, VITAS could be required to return any amounts found to be overpaid, or amounts found to be overpaid could be recouped through reductions in future payments.  There is pressure from state and federal governments and other payors to scrutinize health care claims to determine their validity and appropriateness.  VITAS’ claims have been subject to review and audit.  We cannot assure you that reviews and/or similar audits of VITAS’ claims will not result in material recoupments, denials or other actions that could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business, financial condition and results of operations.  See the discussion of OIG investigations pending against VITAS under Other Health Care Regulations, above.Regulation and Provision of Continuous Home Care.  VITAS provides continuous home care to patients requiring such care.  Continuous home care is provided to patients while at home, during periods of crisis when intensive monitoring and care, primarily nursing care, is required in order to achieve palliation or management of acute medical symptoms.  Continuous home care requires a minimum of 8 hours of care within a 24-hour day, which begins and ends at midnight.  The care must be predominantly nursing care provided by either a registered nurse or licensed practical nurse.Continuous home care can be challenging for a hospice to provide for a number of reasons, including the need to have available sufficient skilled and trained staff to furnish such care, the need to manage the staffing and provision of such care, and a shortage of nurses that can make it particularly difficult to attract and retain nurses that are required to furnish a majority of such care.  Medicare reimbursement for continuous home care has been calculated by multiplying the applicable continuous home care hourly rate by the number of hours of care provided.  If the care was provided for less than one hour, Medicare requires reporting in 15-minute increments of care provided, with no rounding.Medicare reimbursement for continuous home care is subject to a number of requirements posing further challenges for a hospice providing such care.  For example, if a patient requires skilled interventions for palliation or symptom management that can be accomplished in less than 8 aggregate hours within the 24-hour period, if the majority of care can be accomplished by someone other than a registered nurse or a licensed practical nurse (e.g., if a majority of care is furnished by a home health aide or homemaker), or if for any reason less than 8 hours of direct care are provided (such as when a patient dies before 8 AM even if 7 or more hours of care has been provided), the care rendered cannot be reimbursed by Medicare at the continuous home care rate (although the care instead may be eligible for Medicare reimbursement at the reduced routine home care day rate).  As a result of such requirements, VITAS may incur the costs of providing services intended to be continuous home care services yet be unable to bill or be reimbursed for such services at the continuous home care rate.  We cannot assure you that challenges in providing continuous home care will not cause VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profits to materially decline or that reviews and/or similar audits of VITAS’ claims will not result in material recoupments, denials or other actions that could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business, financial condition and results of operations.   17   Compliance.  VITAS maintains an internal regulatory compliance review program and from time to time retains regulatory counsel for guidance on compliance matters.  We cannot assure you, however, that VITAS’ practices, if reviewed, would be found to be in compliance with applicable health regulatory laws, as such laws ultimately may be interpreted, or that any non-compliance with such laws would not have a material adverse effect on VITAS.Federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives could require VITAS to expend substantial sums on acquiring, implementing and supporting new information systems, which could negatively impact its profitability.There are currently numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives at both the state and federal levels that address patient privacy concerns.  We cannot predict the total financial or other impact of the regulations on VITAS’ operations.  In addition, although VITAS’ management believes it is in compliance with the requirement of patient privacy regulations, we cannot assure you that VITAS will not be found to have violated state and federal laws, rules or guidelines surrounding patient privacy.  Compliance with current and future HIPAA and HITECH requirements or any other federal or state privacy initiatives could require VITAS to make substantial investments, which could negatively impact its profitability and cash flows.VITAS’ growth strategies may not be successful, which could adversely affect its business.A significant element of VITAS’ growth strategy is expected to include expansion of its business in new and existing markets.  This aspect of VITAS’ growth strategy may not be successful, which could adversely impact its growth and profitability.  We cannot assure you that VITAS will be able to:  ●Identify markets that meet its selection criteria for new hospice locations;  ●Hire and retain qualified management teams to operate each of its new hospice locations;  ●Manage a large and geographically diverse group of hospice locations;  ●Become Medicare and Medicaid certified in new markets;  ●Generate sufficient hospice admissions to operate profitably in these new markets;  ●Compete effectively with existing hospices in new markets; or  ●Obtain state licensure and/or a certificate of need from appropriate state agencies in new markets.VITAS’ loss of key management personnel or its inability to hire and retain skilled employees could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.VITAS’ future success significantly depends upon the continued service of its senior management personnel.  The loss of one or more of VITAS’ key senior management personnel or its inability to hire and retain new skilled employees could negatively impact VITAS’ ability to maintain or increase patient referrals, a key aspect of its growth strategy, and could adversely affect its future operating results.Competition for skilled employees is intense, and the process of locating and recruiting skilled employees with the combination of qualifications and attributes required to care effectively for terminally ill patients and their families can be difficult and lengthy.  We cannot assure you that VITAS will be successful in attracting, retaining or training highly skilled nursing, management, community education, operations, admissions and other personnel.  VITAS’ business could be disrupted and its growth and profitability negatively impacted if it is unable to attract and retain skilled employees.   18   A nationwide shortage of qualified nurses could adversely affect VITAS’ profitability, growth and ability to continue to provide quality, responsive hospice services to its patients as nursing wages and benefits increase. Approximately 40% of VITAS’ workforce is licensed nurses.  VITAS depends on qualified nurses to provide quality, responsive hospice services to its patients.  The current nationwide shortage of qualified nurses impacts some of the markets in which VITAS provides hospice services.  In response to this shortage, VITAS has adjusted its wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and to engage contract nurses.  VITAS’ inability to attract and retain qualified nurses could adversely affect its ability to provide quality, responsive hospice services to its patients and its ability to increase or maintain patient census in those markets.  Increases in the wages and benefits required to attract and retain qualified nurses or an increase in reliance on contract nurses could negatively impact profitability.VITAS may not be able to compete successfully against other hospice providers, and competitive pressures may limit its ability to maintain or increase its market position and adversely affect its profitability, financial condition and results of operations.Hospice care in the United States is highly competitive.  In many areas in which VITAS’ hospices are located, they compete with a large number of organizations, including:●      Community-based hospice providers;●      National and regional companies;●      Hospital-based hospice and palliative care programs;●      Physician groups;●      Nursing homes;●      Home health agencies;●      Infusion therapy companies; and●      Nursing agencies.Various health care companies have diversified into the hospice industry.  Other companies, including hospitals and health care organizations that are not currently providing hospice care, may enter the markets VITAS serves and expand the variety of services offered to include hospice care.  We cannot assure you that VITAS will not encounter increased competition in the future that could limit its ability to maintain or increase its market position, including competition from parties in a position to impact referrals to VITAS.  Such increased competition could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business, financial condition and results of operations.Changes in rates or methods of payment for VITAS’ services could adversely affect its revenues and profits.Managed care organizations have grown substantially in terms of the percentage of the population they cover and their control over an increasing portion of the health care economy.  Managed care organizations have continued to consolidate to enhance their ability to influence the delivery of health care services and to exert pressure to control health care costs.  VITAS has a number of contractual arrangements with managed care organizations and other similar parties.VITAS provides hospice care to many Medicare beneficiaries who receive their non-hospice health care services from health maintenance organizations (“HMOs”) under Medicare risk contracts.  Under such contracts between HMOs and the federal Department of Health and Human Services, the Medicare payments for hospice services are excluded from the per-member, per-month payment from Medicare to HMOs and instead are paid directly by Medicare to the hospices.  As a result, VITAS’ payments for Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare risk HMOs are processed in the same way with the same rates as other Medicare beneficiaries.  We cannot assure, however, that payment for hospice services will continue to be excluded from HMO payment under Medicare risk contracts and similar Medicare managed care plans or that if not excluded, managed care organizations or other large third-party payors would not use their power to influence and exert pressure on health care providers to reduce costs in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business, financial condition and results of operations.   19   Liability claims may have an adverse effect on VITAS, and its insurance coverage may be inadequate.Participants in the hospice industry are subject to lawsuits alleging negligence, product liability or other similar legal theories, many of which involve large claims and significant defense costs.  From time to time, VITAS is subject to such and other types of lawsuits.  See the description below under Legal Proceedings.  The ultimate liability for claims, if any, could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or operating results.  Although VITAS currently maintains liability insurance intended to cover the claims, we cannot assure you that the coverage limits of such insurance policies will be adequate or that all such claims will be covered by the insurance.  In addition, VITAS’ insurance policies must be renewed annually and may be subject to cancellation during the policy period.  While VITAS has been able to obtain liability insurance in the past, such insurance varies in cost,  and may not be available in the future on terms acceptable to VITAS, if at all.A successful claim in excess of the insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on VITAS.  Claims, regardless of their merit or eventual outcome, also may have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business and reputation due to the costs of litigation, diversion of management’s time and related publicity.VITAS procures professional liability coverage on a claims-made basis.  The insurance contracts specify that coverage is available only during the term of each insurance contract.  VITAS’ management intends to renew or replace the existing claims-made policy annually but such coverage is difficult to obtain, may be subject to cancellation and may be written by carriers that are unable, or unwilling to pay claims Certain claims have been asserted where the coverage would be the responsibility of this prior carrier and/or other carriers that may not have the financial wherewithal to satisfy the claims.  Additionally, some risks and liabilities, including claims for punitive damages, are not covered by insurance.CybersecurityIn the normal course of business, our information technology systems hold sensitive patient information including patient demographic data, eligibility for various medical plans including Medicare and Medicaid and protected health information.  Additionally, we utilize those same systems to perform our day-to-day activities, such as receiving referrals, assigning medical teams to patients, documenting medical information and maintaining an accurate record of all transactions.  We have not experienced any known attacks on our information technology systems that have compromised patient data or the Company’s proprietary data.  We maintain our information technology systems with safeguard protection against cyber-attacks including active intrusion protection, firewalls and virus detection software.  As discussed previously, we are subject to and comply with HIPPA and HITECH regulations.  However, these safeguards do not ensure that a significant cyber-attack could not occur.  A successful attack on our information technology systems could have significant consequences to the business including liability for compromised patient information and business interruption.VITAS’ success is highly dependent on its brand reputationVITAS’ reputation for performing quality routine and high acuity patient hospice care within the regulations mandated by Medicare, Medicaid and commercial payors is critical to our success.  Failure to provide quality patient care within the regulations mandated by our third-party payors, or the perception of inappropriate care resulting in adverse publicity, litigation or a campaign of negative on-line reviews are some of the factors that could negatively impact VITAS’ national reputation.  VITAS maintains a reputation management risk program however, a loss of brand reputation at VITAS could adversely affect referral sources’ willingness to refer our service and thus, adversely affect our future operating performance.VITAS’ headquarters and a significant portion of its operations are in south FloridaThe occurrence of a natural disaster in any region that VITAS has significant operations could have a negative impact on the business.  VITAS’ headquarters are located in Miami, Florida.  In addition, two of our largest programs are in south Florida.  The location of our headquarters and these large programs increases our exposure to hurricanes.  A major hurricane in south Florida could impede our ability to bill for our services, operate our businesses and serve our patients’ in the affected area.  VITAS maintains a disaster recovery program to mitigate this risk however, natural disasters could have an adverse affect on our future operating performance"
18,CHE,CHEMED CORP,2014-02-27,"  Risk Factors
You should carefully consider the risks described below.  They are not the only ones facing the Company.  Other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.GENERALWe have incurred debt to finance the operations of the Company.We have debt which is due in May 2014 that is convertible into shares based on the Company’s stock price.  This could significantly dilute the ownership percentage of current stockholders.The Company has debt service obligations that may restrict our operating flexibility.  We cannot assure you that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to service our debt, which may require us to borrow additional funds, or restructure or otherwise refinance our debt.  In addition, the Company has the ability to expand its debt and borrowing capacity subject to various restrictions and covenants defined by its creditors.  The interest rate the Company pays will fluctuate from time to time based upon a number of factors including current LIBOR rates and Company operating performance.  Significant changes in these factors could result in a material change in the Company’s interest expense.Our ability to repay or to refinance our indebtedness and to pay interest on our indebtedness will depend on our operating performance, which may be affected by factors beyond our control.  These factors could include operating difficulties, increased operating costs, our competitors’ actions and regulatory developments.  Our ability to meet our debt service and other obligations may depend in significant part on the extent to which we successfully implement our business strategy.  We cannot assure you that we will be able to implement our strategy fully or that the anticipated results of our strategy will be realized.  Credit market conditions may make it difficult for us to obtain new financing or refinance our current debt on terms and conditions acceptable to us.If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional equity capital or restructure our debt.  We cannot assure you that our cash flows and capital resources will be sufficient to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness in the future or that alternative measures would successfully meet our debt service obligations.The agreements and instruments governing our outstanding debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business and adversely affect the price of our Capital Stock.The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our instruments of indebtedness restrict our ability to incur additional debt; issue and sell capital stock of subsidiaries; sell assets; engage in transactions with affiliates; restrict distributions from subsidiaries; incur liens; engage in business other than permitted businesses; engage in sale/leaseback transactions; engage in mergers or consolidations; make capital expenditures; make guarantees; make investments and acquisitions; enter into operating leases; hedge interest rates; and prepay other debt.Moreover, if we are unable to meet the terms of the financial covenants or if we breach any of these covenants, a default could result under one or more of these agreements.  A default, if not waived by our lenders, could accelerate repayment of our outstanding indebtedness.  If acceleration occurs, we may not be able to repay our debt and it is unlikely that we would be able to borrow sufficient additional funds to refinance such debt on acceptable terms.  In the event of any default under our credit facilities, the lenders thereunder could elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, to be due and payable, and to require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings, any of which would be an event of default. We depend on our management team and the loss of their service could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of our executive management team.  The loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract or retain other skilled personnel in the future.   12   Environmental compliance costs and liabilities could increase our expenses and adversely affect our financial condition.Our operations are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that prohibit or restrict the discharge of pollutants into the environment and regulate employee exposure to hazardous substance in the workplace.  Failure to comply with these laws could subject us to material costs and liabilities, including civil and criminal fines, costs to cleanup contamination we cause and, in some circumstances, costs to cleanup contamination we discover on our own property but did not cause.Because we use and generate hazardous materials in some of our operations, we are potentially subject to material liabilities relating to the cleanup of contamination and personal injury claims.  In addition, we have retained certain environmental liabilities in connection with the sale of former businesses.  We are currently funding the cleanup of historical contamination at one of our former properties and contributing to the cleanup of third-party sites as a result of our sale of our former subsidiary DuBois Chemicals Inc.  Although we have established a reserve for these liabilities, actual cleanup costs may exceed our current estimates due to factors beyond our control, such as the discovery of additional contamination or the enforcement of more stringent cleanup requirements.  New laws and regulations or their stricter enforcement, the discovery of presently unknown conditions or the receipt of additional claims for indemnification could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities including impairment of our brand that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to certain anti-takeover statutes that might make it more difficult to effect a change in control of the Company.We are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits us from engaging in a “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.  The application of Section 203 could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control that could be advantageous to stockholders.An adverse ruling against us in certain litigation could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.We are involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of our business currently and from time to time.  The damages claimed against us in some of these cases are substantial.  See the “Legal Proceedings” sections of this 10-K for discussion of particular matters. We cannot assure you that we will prevail in pending cases.  Regardless of the outcome, such litigation is costly to manage, investigate and defend, and the related defense costs, diversion of management’s time and related publicity may adversely affect the conduct of our business and the results of our operations.ROTO-ROOTERWe face intense competition from numerous, fragmented competitors.  If we do not compete effectively, our business may suffer.We face intense competition from numerous competitors.  The sewer, drain and pipe cleaning, excavation and plumbing repair businesses are highly fragmented, with the bulk of the industries consisting of local and regional competitors.  We compete primarily on the basis of advertising, range of services provided, name recognition, availability of emergency service, speed and quality of customer service, service guarantees and pricing.  Our competitors may succeed in developing new or enhanced products and services more successful than ours and in marketing and selling existing and new products and services better than we do.  In addition, new competitors may emerge.  We cannot make any assurances that we will continue to be able to compete successfully with any of these companies.Our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations, exposing us to potential claims and compliance costs that could adversely affect our business.We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to franchising, insurance and other aspects of our business.  These are discussed in greater detail under “Government Regulations” in the Description of Business section hereof.  If we fail to comply with existing or future laws and regulations, we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines and sanctions.  Our franchising activities are subject to various federal and state franchising laws and regulations, including the rules and regulations of the FTC regarding the offering or sale of franchises.  These rules and regulations require us to provide all of our prospective franchisees with specific information regarding us and our franchise program in the form of a detailed franchise offering circular.  In addition, a number of states require us to register our franchise offering prior to offering or selling franchises in such states.  Various state laws also provide for certain rights in favor of franchisees, including (i) limitations on the franchisor’s ability to terminate a franchise except for good cause, (ii) restrictions on the franchisor’s ability to deny renewal of a franchise, (iii) circumstances under which the franchisor may be required to purchase certain inventory of franchisees when a franchise is terminated or not renewed in violation of such laws and (iv) provisions relating to arbitration.  The ability to engage in the plumbing repair business is also subject to certain limitations and restrictions imposed by the state and local licensing laws and regulations.   We cannot predict what legislation or regulations affecting our business will be enacted in the future, how existing or future laws or regulations will be enforced, administered and interpreted, or the amount of future expenditures that may be required to comply with these laws or regulations.  Compliance costs associated with governmental regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.   13  Roto-Rooter’s loss of key management personnel or its inability to hire and retain skilled employees could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.Roto-Rooter’s future success significantly depends upon the continued service of its senior management personnel.  The loss of one or more of Roto-Rooter’s key senior management personnel or its inability to hire and retain new skilled employees could negatively impact its ability to maintain or increase customer calls and jobs, a key aspect of its growth strategy, and could adversely affect its future operating results.Competition for skilled employees, particularly licensed plumbers, is intense, and the process of locating and recruiting skilled employees with the combination of qualifications and attributes required to adequately perform plumbing duties can be difficult and lengthy.  We cannot assure you that Roto-Rooter will be successful in attracting, retaining or training highly skilled personnel.  Roto-Rooter’s business could be disrupted and its growth and profitability negatively impacted if it is unable to attract and retain skilled employees.CybersecurityIn the normal course of business, our information technology systems hold sensitive customer information including names, addresses and partial credit card information.  Additionally, we utilize those same systems to perform our day-to-day activities, such as receiving customer calls, dispatching technicians to jobs and maintaining an accurate record of all transactions.  We have not experienced any known attacks on our information technology systems that compromised customer data or the Company’s proprietary data.  We maintain our information technology systems with safeguard protection against cyber-attacks including passive intrusion protection, firewalls and virus detection software.  Additionally, on a quarterly basis, we test our information technology systems using cyber-attack software and methods to learn how a successful attack may be made.  We remedy any issues encountered during these tests.  However, these safeguards do not ensure that a significant cyber-attack could not occur.  A successful attack on our information technology systems could have significant consequences to the business including liability for compromised customer information and business interruption.Roto-Rooter’s success is highly dependent on its brand reputationRoto-Rooter's national reputation and brand image for performing necessary, high quality services in a timely manner is critical to Roto-Rooter's continued success. Adverse publicity, litigation or on-line negative reviews focused on the Roto-Rooter brand could negatively impact Roto-Rooter's national reputation resulting in decreased future demand for Roto-Rooter branded services. Roto-Rooter maintains a reputation management risk program however, a loss of brand reputation at Roto-Rooter could adversely affect consumer willingness to use our service and thus, adversely affect our future operating performance.VITASVITAS is highly dependent on payments from Medicare and Medicaid.  If there are changes in the rate or methods governing these payments, VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profits could materially decline.In excess of 90% of VITAS’ net patient service revenue consists of payments from the Medicare and Medicaid programs.  Such payments are made primarily on a “per diem” basis, subject to annual reimbursement caps.  Because VITAS receives a per diem fee to provide eligible services to all patients, VITAS’ profitability is largely dependent upon its ability to manage the costs of providing hospice services to patients.  Increases in operating costs, such as labor and supply costs that are subject to inflation, without a compensating increase in Medicare and Medicaid rates, could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business in the future.  Medicare and Medicaid currently adjust the various hospice payment rates annually based primarily on the increase or decrease of the hospital wage index basket, regionally adjusted.  However, the increases may be less than actual inflation.  VITAS’ profitability could be negatively impacted if this adjustment were eliminated or reduced, or if VITAS’ costs of providing hospice services increased more than the annual adjustment.  In addition, cost pressures resulting from shorter patient lengths of stay and the use of more expensive forms of palliative care, including drugs and drug delivery systems, could negatively impact VITAS’ profitability.  Many payors are increasing pressure to control health care costs.  In addition, both public and private payors are increasing pressure to decrease, or limit increases in, reimbursement rates for health care services.  VITAS’ levels of revenue and profitability will be subject to the effect of possible reductions in coverage or payment rates by third-party payors, including payment rates from Medicare and Medicaid.   14  Each state that maintains a Medicaid program has the option to provide reimbursement for hospice services at reimbursement rates generally required to be at least as much as Medicare rates.  All states in which VITAS operates cover Medicaid hospice services; however, we cannot assure you that the states in which VITAS is presently operating or states into which VITAS could expand operations will continue to cover Medicaid hospice services.  In addition, the Medicare and Medicaid programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive and prospective rate and payment adjustments, administrative rulings, freezes and funding reductions, all of which may adversely affect the level of program payments and could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business.  We cannot assure that Medicare and/or Medicaid payments to hospices will not decrease.  Reductions in amounts paid by government programs for services or changes in methods or regulations governing payments could cause VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profits to materially decline.Approximately 20% of VITAS’ days of care are provided to patients who reside in nursing homes. Changes in the laws and regulations regarding payments for hospice services and “room and board” provided to VITAS’ hospice patients residing in nursing homes could reduce its net patient service revenue and profitability.For VITAS’ hospice patients receiving nursing home care under certain state Medicaid programs who elect hospice care under Medicare and Medicaid, the state generally must pay VITAS, in addition to the applicable Medicare or Medicaid hospice per diem rate, an amount equal to at least 95% of the Medicaid per diem nursing home rate for “room and board” furnished to the patient by the nursing home.  VITAS contracts with various nursing homes for the nursing homes’ provision of certain “room and board” services that the nursing homes would otherwise provide Medicaid nursing home patients.  VITAS bills and collects from the applicable state Medicaid program an amount equal to approximately 95% of the amount that would otherwise have been paid directly to the nursing home under the state’s Medicaid plan.  Under VITAS’ standard nursing home contracts, it pays the nursing home for these “room and board” services at approximately 100% of the Medicaid per diem nursing home rate.The reduction or elimination of Medicare and Medicaid payments for hospice patients residing in nursing homes would reduce VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profitability.  In addition, changes in the way nursing homes are reimbursed for “room and board” services provided to hospice patients residing in nursing homes could affect VITAS’ ability to serve patients in nursing homes.If VITAS is unable to maintain relationships with existing patient referral sources or to establish new referral sources, VITAS’ growth and profitability could be adversely affected.VITAS’ success is heavily dependent on referrals from physicians, long-term care facilities, hospitals and other institutional health care providers, managed care companies, insurance companies and other patient referral sources in the communities that its hospice locations serve, as well as on its ability to maintain good relations with these referral sources.  VITAS’ referral sources may refer their patients to other hospice care providers or not to a hospice provider at all.  VITAS’ growth and profitability depend significantly on its ability to establish and maintain close working relationships with these patient referral sources and to increase awareness and acceptance of hospice care by its referral sources and their patients.  We cannot assure you that VITAS will be able to maintain its existing relationships or that it will be able to develop and maintain new relationships in existing or new markets.  VITAS’ loss of existing relationships or its failure to develop new relationships could adversely affect its ability to expand or maintain its operations and operate profitably.  Moreover, we cannot assure you that awareness or acceptance of hospice care will increase or remain at current levels.VITAS operates in an industry that is subject to extensive government regulation and claims reviews, and changes in law and regulatory interpretations could reduce its net patient service revenue and profitability and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.  15  The healthcare industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations relating to, among others: ●     Payment for services;●     Conduct of operations, including fraud and abuse, anti-kickback prohibitions, self-referral prohibitions and false claims; ●     Privacy and security of medical records; ●     Employment practices; and ●     Conduct of operations, including fraud and abuse, anti-kickback prohibitions, self-referral prohibitions and false claims;●     Various state approval requirements, such as facility and professional licensure, certificate of need, compliance surveys and other certification or recertification requirements.Changes in these laws, rules and regulations or in interpretations thereof could reduce VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profitability.  VITAS’ ability to comply with such regulations is a key factor in determining the success of its business.  See the “Government Regulations” section of this 10-K for a greater description of these matters.Fraud and Abuse Laws.  VITAS contracts with a significant number of health care providers and practitioners, including physicians, hospitals and nursing homes and arranges for these entities to provide services to VITAS’ patients.  Some of these health care providers and practitioners may refer, or be in a position to refer, patients to VITAS (or VITAS may refer patients to them).  These arrangements may not qualify for a safe harbor.  VITAS from time to time seeks guidance from regulatory counsel as to the changing and evolving interpretations and the potential applicability of the Anti-Kickback Law to its programs, and in response thereto, takes such actions as it deems appropriate.  VITAS generally believes that its contracts and arrangements with providers, practitioners and suppliers should not be found to violate the Anti-Kickback Law.  However, we cannot assure you that such laws will ultimately be interpreted in a manner consistent with VITAS’ practices.Several health care reform proposals have included an expansion of the Anti-Kickback Law to include referrals of any patients regardless of payor source, which is similar to the scope of certain laws that have been enacted at the state level.  In addition, a number of states in which VITAS operates have laws, which vary from state to state, prohibiting certain direct or indirect remuneration or fee-splitting arrangements between health care providers, regardless of payor source, for the referral of patients to a particular provider.The federal Ethics in Patient Referral Act, Section 1877 of the Social Security Act (commonly known as the “Stark Law”) prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients for “designated health services” to entities in which they hold an ownership or investment interest or with whom they have a compensation arrangement, subject to certain statutory or regulatory exceptions.  We cannot assure you that future statutory or regulatory changes will not result in hospice services being subject to the Stark Law’s ownership, investment, compensation or referral prohibitions.  Several states in which VITAS operates have similar laws which likewise are subject to change.  Any such changes could adversely affect the business, financial condition and operating results of VITAS.Further, under separate statutes, submission of claims for items or services that are “not provided as claimed” may lead to civil money penalties, criminal fines and imprisonment and/or exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federally funded state health care programs.  These false claims statutes include the federal False Claims Act, which allows any person to bring suit on behalf of the federal government, known as a qui tam action, alleging false or fraudulent Medicare or Medicaid claims or other violations of the statute and to share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement.  See the discussion of the governmental investigations and litigation pending against VITAS under Other Healthcare Regulations, above and Legal Proceedings, below.Certificate of Need Laws.  Many states, including Florida, have certificate of need laws or other similar health planning laws that apply to hospice care providers.  These states may require some form of state agency review or approval prior to opening a new hospice program, to adding or expanding hospice services, to undertaking significant capital expenditures or under other specified circumstances.  Approval under these certificate of need laws is generally conditioned on the showing of a demonstrable need for services in the community.  VITAS may seek to develop, acquire or expand hospice programs in states having certificate of need laws.  To the extent that state agencies require VITAS to obtain a certificate of need or other similar approvals to expand services at existing hospice programs or to make acquisitions or develop hospice programs in new or existing geographical markets, VITAS’ plans could be adversely affected by a failure to obtain a certificate or approval.  In addition, competitors may seek administratively or judicially to challenge such an approval or proposed approval by the state agency.  Such a challenge, whether or not ultimately successful, could adversely affect VITAS.   16  Other Federal and State Regulations. The federal government and all states regulate various aspects of the hospice industry and VITAS’ business. In particular, VITAS’ operations are subject to federal and state health regulatory laws, including those covering professional services, the dispensing of drugs and certain types of hospice activities. Certain of VITAS’ employees are subject to state laws and regulations governing professional practice. VITAS’ operations are subject to periodic survey by governmental authorities and private accrediting entities to assure compliance with applicable state licensing, and Medicare and Medicaid certification and accreditation standards, as the case may be. From time to time in the ordinary course of business, VITAS receives survey reports noting deficiencies for alleged failure to comply with applicable requirements. VITAS reviews such reports and takes appropriate corrective action. The failure to effect such action could result in one of VITAS’ hospice programs being terminated from the Medicare hospice program. Any termination of one or more of VITAS’ hospice locations from the Medicare hospice program could adversely affect VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profitability and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. The failure to obtain, renew or maintain any of the required regulatory approvals, certifications or licenses could materially adversely affect VITAS’ business and could prevent the programs involved from offering products and services to patients. In addition, laws and regulations often are adopted to regulate new products, services and industries. We cannot assure you that either the states or the federal government will not impose additional regulations on VITAS’ activities, which might materially adversely affect VITAS, including impairing the value of its brand. Claims Review. The Medicare and Medicaid programs and their fiscal intermediaries and other payors periodically conduct pre-payment or post-payment reviews and other reviews and audits of health care claims, including hospice claims. As a result of such reviews or audits, VITAS could be required to return any amounts found to be overpaid, or amounts found to be overpaid could be recouped through reductions in future payments. There is pressure from state and federal governments and other payors to scrutinize health care claims to determine their validity and appropriateness. VITAS’ claims have been subject to review and audit. We cannot assure you that reviews and/or similar audits of VITAS’ claims will not result in material recoupments, denials or other actions that could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business, financial condition and results of operations. See the discussion of OIG investigations pending against VITAS under Other Health Care Regulations, above. Regulation and Provision of Continuous Home Care. VITAS provides continuous home care to patients requiring such care. Continuous home care is provided to patients while at home, during periods of crisis when intensive monitoring and care, primarily nursing care, is required in order to achieve palliation or management of acute medical symptoms. Continuous home care requires a minimum of 8 hours of care within a 24-hour day, which begins and ends at midnight. The care must be predominantly nursing care provided by either a registered nurse or licensed practical nurse. Continuous home care can be challenging for a hospice to provide for a number of reasons, including the need to have available sufficient skilled and trained staff to furnish such care, the need to manage the staffing and provision of such care, and a shortage of nurses that can make it particularly difficult to attract and retain nurses that are required to furnish a majority of such care. Medicare reimbursement for continuous home care has been calculated by multiplying the applicable continuous home care hourly rate by the number of hours of care provided. If the care was provided for less than one hour, Medicare requires reporting in 15-minute increments of care provided, with no rounding. Medicare reimbursement for continuous home care is subject to a number of requirements posing further challenges for a hospice providing such care. For example, if a patient requires skilled interventions for palliation or symptom management that can be accomplished in less than 8 aggregate hours within the 24-hour period, if the majority of care can be accomplished by someone other than a registered nurse or a licensed practical nurse (e.g., if a majority of care is furnished by a home health aide or homemaker), or if for any reason less than 8 hours of direct care are provided (such as when a patient dies before 8 AM even if 7 or more hours of care has been provided), the care rendered cannot be reimbursed by Medicare at the continuous home care rate (although the care instead may be eligible for Medicare reimbursement at the reduced routine home care day rate). As a result of such requirements, VITAS may incur the costs of providing services intended to be continuous home care services yet be unable to bill or be reimbursed for such services at the continuous home care rate. We cannot assure you that challenges in providing continuous home care will not cause VITAS’ net patient service revenue and profits to materially decline or that reviews and/or similar audits of VITAS’ claims will not result in material recoupments, denials or other actions that could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business, financial condition and results of operations. Compliance. VITAS maintains an internal regulatory compliance review program and from time to time retains regulatory counsel for guidance on compliance matters. We cannot assure you, however, that VITAS’ practices, if reviewed, would be found to be in compliance with applicable health regulatory laws, as such laws ultimately may be interpreted, or that any non-compliance with such laws would not have a material adverse effect on VITAS.   17  Federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives could require VITAS to expend substantial sums on acquiring, implementing and supporting new information systems, which could negatively impact its profitability.There are currently numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives at both the state and federal levels that address patient privacy concerns.  We cannot predict the total financial or other impact of the regulations on VITAS’ operations.  In addition, although VITAS’ management believes it is in compliance with the requirement of patient privacy regulations, we cannot assure you that VITAS will not be found to have violated state and federal laws, rules or guidelines surrounding patient privacy.  Compliance with current and future HIPAA requirements or any other federal or state privacy initiatives could require VITAS to make substantial investments, which could negatively impact its profitability and cash flows.VITAS’ growth strategies may not be successful, which could adversely affect its business.A significant element of VITAS’ growth strategy is expected to include expansion of its business in new and existing markets.  This aspect of VITAS’ growth strategy may not be successful, which could adversely impact its growth and profitability.  We cannot assure you that VITAS will be able to:●     Identify markets that meet its selection criteria for new hospice locations;●     Hire and retain qualified management teams to operate each of its new hospice locations;●     Manage a large and geographically diverse group of hospice locations;●     Become Medicare and Medicaid certified in new markets;●     Generate sufficient hospice admissions in new markets to operate profitably in these new markets;●     Compete effectively with existing hospices in new markets; or●     Obtain state licensure and/or a certificate of need from appropriate state agencies in new markets.In addition to growing existing locations and developing new hospice locations, VITAS’ growth is expected to include expansion through acquisition of other hospices.  We cannot assure you that VITAS’ acquisition strategy will be successful.  The success of VITAS’ acquisition strategy depends upon a number of factors, including:●     Its ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates; ●     Its ability to negotiate favorable acquisition terms, including purchase price, which may be adversely affected due to increased competition with other buyers;●     The availability of financing on favorable terms, or at all;●     Its ability to integrate effectively the systems and operations of acquired hospices;●     Its ability to retain key personnel of acquired hospices; and●     Its ability to obtain required regulatory approvals.Acquisitions involve a number of other risks, including diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and assuming known or unknown liabilities of acquired hospices, including liabilities for failure to comply with health care laws and regulations.  Integrating acquired hospices may place significant strains on VITAS’ current operating and financial systems and controls.  VITAS may not successfully overcome these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with its acquisition strategy.In addition, since 1990, VITAS has acquired hospice programs, some of which involved acquisitions of hospice programs from not-for-profit entities.  VITAS believes that acquisitions of not-for-profit programs are generally more complex than acquisitions from for-profit entities and that a substantial number of acquisition opportunities are likely to involve acquisitions from not-for-profit entities.  Such acquisitions are subject to provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and, in certain states, state attorney general powers, which have been interpreted to require that the consideration paid for the assets purchased be at fair market value and, where applicable, that any fees paid for services be reasonable.  In many states there is no mechanism for state attorney general pre-clearance of transactions to assure that applicable standards have been met.  Entities that acquired not-for-profit hospices could face potential liability if the acquisition transaction is not structured to comply with Internal Revenue Code and state law requirements, and in some cases the transaction could be enjoined or subject to rescission.  The acquisition of not-for-profit businesses, including the fairness of the purchase price paid, has received increasing regulatory scrutiny by state attorneys general and other regulatory authorities.  Although VITAS believes that reasonable actions have been taken to date to establish the fair market value of assets purchased in prior acquisitions of hospice operations from not-for-profit entities and the reasonableness of fees paid for services, we cannot assure you that such transactions or any future similar transactions will not be challenged or that, if challenged, the results of such challenge would not have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business.   18  VITAS’ loss of key management personnel or its inability to hire and retain skilled employees could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.VITAS’ future success significantly depends upon the continued service of its senior management personnel.  The loss of one or more of VITAS’ key senior management personnel or its inability to hire and retain new skilled employees could negatively impact VITAS’ ability to maintain or increase patient referrals, a key aspect of its growth strategy, and could adversely affect its future operating results.Competition for skilled employees is intense, and the process of locating and recruiting skilled employees with the combination of qualifications and attributes required to care effectively for terminally ill patients and their families can be difficult and lengthy.  We cannot assure you that VITAS will be successful in attracting, retaining or training highly skilled nursing, management, community education, operations, admissions and other personnel.  VITAS’ business could be disrupted and its growth and profitability negatively impacted if it is unable to attract and retain skilled employees. A nationwide shortage of qualified nurses could adversely affect VITAS’ profitability, growth and ability to continue to provide quality, responsive hospice services to its patients as nursing wages and benefits increase.Approximately 40% of VITAS’ workforce is licensed nurses.  VITAS depends on qualified nurses to provide quality, responsive hospice services to its patients.  The current nationwide shortage of qualified nurses impacts some of the markets in which VITAS provides hospice services.  In response to this shortage, VITAS has adjusted its wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and to engage contract nurses.  VITAS’ inability to attract and retain qualified nurses could adversely affect its ability to provide quality, responsive hospice services to its patients and its ability to increase or maintain patient census in those markets.  Increases in the wages and benefits required to attract and retain qualified nurses or an increase in reliance on contract nurses could negatively impact profitability.VITAS may not be able to compete successfully against other hospice providers, and competitive pressures may limit its ability to maintain or increase its market position and adversely affect its profitability, financial condition and results of operations.Hospice care in the United States is highly competitive.  In many areas in which VITAS’ hospices are located, they compete with a large number of organizations, including:●     Community-based hospice providers; ●     National and regional companies;●     Hospital-based hospice and palliative care programs;●     Physician groups; ●     Nursing homes; ●     Home health agencies;●     Infusion therapy companies; and ●     Nursing agencies.   19   Various health care companies have diversified into the hospice market.  Other companies, including hospitals and health care organizations that are not currently providing hospice care, may enter the markets VITAS serves and expand the variety of services offered to include hospice care.  We cannot assure you that VITAS will not encounter increased competition in the future that could limit its ability to maintain or increase its market position, including competition from parties in a position to impact referrals to VITAS.  Such increased competition could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business, financial condition and results of operations.Changes in rates or methods of payment for VITAS’ services could adversely affect its revenues and profits.Managed care organizations have grown substantially in terms of the percentage of the population they cover and their control over an increasing portion of the health care economy.  Managed care organizations have continued to consolidate to enhance their ability to influence the delivery of health care services and to exert pressure to control health care costs.  VITAS has a number of contractual arrangements with managed care organizations and other similar parties.VITAS provides hospice care to many Medicare beneficiaries who receive their non-hospice health care services from health maintenance organizations (“HMOs”) under Medicare risk contracts.  Under such contracts between HMOs and the federal Department of Health and Human Services, the Medicare payments for hospice services are excluded from the per-member, per-month payment from Medicare to HMOs and instead are paid directly by Medicare to the hospices.  As a result, VITAS’ payments for Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare risk HMOs are processed in the same way with the same rates as other Medicare beneficiaries.  We cannot assure, however, that payment for hospice services will continue to be excluded from HMO payment under Medicare risk contracts and similar Medicare managed care plans or that if not excluded, managed care organizations or other large third-party payors would not use their power to influence and exert pressure on health care providers to reduce costs in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business, financial condition and results of operations.Liability claims may have an adverse effect on VITAS, and its insurance coverage may be inadequate.Participants in the hospice industry are subject to lawsuits alleging negligence, product liability or other similar legal theories, many of which involve large claims and significant defense costs.  From time to time, VITAS is subject to such and other types of lawsuits.  See the description below under Legal Proceedings.  The ultimate liability for claims, if any, could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or operating results.  Although VITAS currently maintains liability insurance intended to cover the claims, we cannot assure you that the coverage limits of such insurance policies will be adequate or that all such claims will be covered by the insurance.  In addition, VITAS’ insurance policies must be renewed annually and may be subject to cancellation during the policy period.  While VITAS has been able to obtain liability insurance in the past, such insurance varies in cost,  and may not be available in the future on terms acceptable to VITAS, if at all.A successful claim in excess of the insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on VITAS.  Claims, regardless of their merit or eventual outcome, also may have a material adverse effect on VITAS’ business and reputation due to the costs of litigation, diversion of management’s time and related publicity.VITAS procures professional liability coverage on a claims-made basis.  The insurance contracts specify that coverage is available only during the term of each insurance contract.  VITAS’ management intends to renew or replace the existing claims-made policy annually but such coverage is difficult to obtain, may be subject to cancellation and may be written by carriers that are unable, or unwilling to pay claims.  During fiscal 2001, VITAS was notified that one of its prior carriers was ordered into rehabilitation, and in early fiscal 2002, into liquidation, creating the possibility that certain prior year claims could be underinsured or uninsured.  Certain claims have been asserted where the coverage would be the responsibility of this prior carrier and/or other carriers that may not have the financial wherewithal to satisfy the claims.  Additionally, some risks and liabilities, including claims for punitive damages, are not covered by insurance.CybersecurityIn the normal course of business, our information technology systems hold sensitive patient information including patient demographic data, eligibility for various medical plans including Medicare and Medicaid and protected health information.  Additionally, we utilize those same systems to perform our day-to-day activities, such as receiving referrals, assigning medical teams to patients, documenting medical information and maintaining an accurate record of all transactions.  We have not experienced any known attacks on our information technology systems that have compromised patient data or the Company’s proprietary data.  We maintain our information technology systems with  safeguard protection against cyber-attacks including passive intrusion protection, firewalls and virus detection software.  As discussed previously, we are subject to and comply with HIPPA regulations.  However, these safeguards do not ensure that a significant cyber-attack could not occur.  A successful attack on our information technology systems could have significant consequences to the business including liability for compromised patient information and business interruption.   20  VITAS’ success is highly dependent on its brand reputationVITAS’ reputation for performing quality routine and high acuity patient hospice care within the regulations mandated by Medicare, Medicaid and commercial payors is critical to our success.  Failure to provide quality patient care within the regulations mandated by our third-party payors, or the perception of inappropriate care resulting in adverse publicity, litigation or a campaign of negative on-line reviews are some of the factors that could negatively impact VITAS’ national reputation.  VITAS maintains a reputation management risk program however, a loss of brand reputation at VITAS could adversely affect referral sources’ willingness to refer our service and thus, adversely affect our future operating performance.VITAS’ headquarters and a significant portion of its operations are in south FloridaThe occurrence of a natural disaster in any region that VITAS has significant operations could have a negative impact on the business.  VITAS’ headquarters are located in Miami, Florida.  In addition, two of our largest programs are in south Florida.  The location of our headquarters and these large programs increases our exposure to hurricanes.  A major hurricane in south Florida could impede our ability to bill for our services, operate our businesses and serve our patients’ in the affected area.  VITAS maintains a disaster recovery program to mitigate this risk however, natural disasters could have an adverse affect on our future operating performance"
17,CHE,CHEMED CORP,2013-02-27,"  Risk Factors
You should carefully consider the risks described below.  They are not the only ones facing the Company.  Other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.GENERALWe have incurred debt to finance the operations of the Company.We have debt that is convertible into shares based on the Company’s stock price.  This could significantly dilute the ownership percentage of current stockholders.The Company has debt service obligations that may restrict our operating flexibility.  We cannot assure you that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to service our debt, which may require us to borrow additional funds, or restructure or otherwise refinance our debt.  In addition, the Company has the ability to expand its debt and borrowing capacity subject to various restrictions and covenants defined by its creditors.  The interest rate the Company pays will fluctuate from time to time based upon a number of factors including current LIBOR rates and Company operating performance.  Significant changes in these factors could result in a material change in the Company’s interest expense.Our ability to repay or to refinance our indebtedness and to pay interest on our indebtedness will depend on our operating performance, which may be affected by factors beyond our control.  These factors could include operating difficulties, increased operating costs, our competitors’ actions and regulatory developments.  Our ability to meet our debt service and other obligations may depend in significant part on the extent to which we successfully implement our business strategy.  We cannot assure you that we will be able to implement our strategy fully or that the anticipated results of our strategy will be realized.  Credit market conditions may make it difficult for us to obtain new financing or refinance our current debt on terms and conditions acceptable to us.If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional equity capital or restructure our debt.  We cannot assure you that our cash flows and capital resources will be sufficient to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness in the future or that alternative measures would successfully meet our debt service obligations.The agreements and instruments governing our outstanding debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business and adversely affect the price of our Capital Stock.The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our instruments of indebtedness restrict our ability to incur additional debt; issue and sell capital stock of subsidiaries; sell assets; engage in transactions with affiliates; restrict distributions from subsidiaries; incur liens; engage in business other than permitted businesses; engage in sale/leaseback transactions; engage in mergers or consolidations; make capital expenditures; make guarantees; make investments and acquisitions; enter into operating leases; hedge interest rates; and prepay other debt.Moreover, if we are unable to meet the terms of the financial covenants or if we breach any of these covenants, a default could result under one or more of these agreements.  A default, if not waived by our lenders, could accelerate repayment of our outstanding indebtedness.  If acceleration occurs, we may not be able to repay our debt and it is unlikely that we would be able to borrow sufficient additional funds to refinance such debt on acceptable terms.  In the event of any default under our credit facilities, the lenders thereunder could elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, to be due and payable, and to require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings, any of which would be an event of default.  12   We depend on our management team and the loss of their service could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of our executive management team.  The loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract or retain other skilled personnel in the future.Environmental compliance costs and liabilities could increase our expenses and adversely affect our financial condition.Our operations are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that prohibit or restrict the discharge of pollutants into the environment and regulate employee exposure to hazardous substance in the workplace.  Failure to comply with these laws could subject us to material costs and liabilities, including civil and criminal fines, costs to cleanup contamination we cause and, in some circumstances, costs to cleanup contamination we discover on our own property but did not cause.Because we use and generate hazardous materials in some of our operations, we are potentially subject to material liabilities relating to the cleanup of contamination and personal injury claims.  In addition, we have retained certain environmental liabilities in connection with the sale of former businesses.  We are currently funding the cleanup of historical contamination at one of our former properties and contributing to the cleanup of third-party sites as a result of our sale of our former subsidiary DuBois Chemicals Inc.  Although we have established a reserve for these liabilities, actual cleanup costs may exceed our current estimates due to factors beyond our control, such as the discovery of additional contamination or the enforcement of more stringent cleanup requirements.  New laws and regulations or their stricter enforcement, the discovery of presently unknown conditions or the receipt of additional claims for indemnification could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities including impairment of our brand that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to certain anti-takeover statutes that might make it more difficult to effect a change in control of the Company.We are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits us from engaging in a “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.  The application of Section 203 could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control that could be advantageous to stockholders.An adverse ruling against us in certain litigation could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.We are involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of our business currently and from time to time.  The damages claimed against us in some of these cases are substantial.  See the “Legal Proceedings” sections of this 10-K for discussion of particular matters. We cannot assure you that we will prevail in pending cases.  Regardless of the outcome, such litigation is costly to manage, investigate and defend, and the related defense costs, diversion of management’s time and related publicity may adversely affect the conduct of our business and the results of our operations.ROTO-ROOTERWe face intense competition from numerous, fragmented competitors.  If we do not compete effectively, our business may suffer.We face intense competition from numerous competitors.  The sewer, drain and pipe cleaning, and plumbing repair businesses are highly fragmented, with the bulk of the industries consisting of local and regional competitors.  We compete primarily on the basis of advertising, range of services provided, name recognition, availability of emergency service, speed and quality of customer service, service guarantees and pricing.  Our competitors may succeed in developing new or enhanced products and services more successful than ours and in marketing and selling existing and new products and services better than we do.  In addition, new competitors may emerge.  We cannot make any assurances that we will continue to be able to compete successfully with any of these companies.  13   Our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations, exposing us to potential claims and compliance costs that could adversely affect our business.We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to franchising, insurance and other aspects of our business.  These are discussed in greater detail under “Government Regulations” in the Description of Business section hereof.  If we fail to comply with existing or future laws and regulations, we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines and sanctions.  Our franchising activities are subject to various federal and state franchising laws and regulations, including the rules and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) regarding the offering or sale of franchises.  The rules and regulations of the FTC require us to provide all of our prospective franchisees with specific information regarding us and our franchise program in the form of a detailed franchise offering circular.  In addition, a number of states require us to register our franchise offering prior to offering or selling franchises in such states.  Various state laws also provide for certain rights in favor of franchisees, including (i) limitations on the franchisor’s ability to terminate a franchise except for good cause, (ii) restrictions on the franchisor’s ability to deny renewal of a franchise, (iii) circumstances under which the franchisor may be required to purchase certain inventory of franchisees when a franchise is terminated or not renewed in violation of such laws and (iv) provisions relating to arbitration.  The ability to engage in the plumbing repair business is also subject to certain limitations and restrictions imposed by the state and local licensing laws and regulations.   We cannot predict what legislation or regulations affecting our business will be enacted in the future, how existing or future laws or regulations will be enforced, administered and interpreted, or the amount of future expenditures that may be required to comply with these laws or regulations.  Compliance costs associated with governmental regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Roto-Rooter’s loss of key management personnel or its inability to hire and retain skilled employees could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.Roto-Rooter’s future success significantly depends upon the continued service of its senior management personnel.  The loss of one or more of Roto-Rooter’s key senior management personnel or its inability to hire and retain new skilled employees could negatively impact its ability to maintain or increase customer calls and jobs, a key aspect of its growth strategy, and could adversely affect its future operating results.Competition for skilled employees, particularly related to licensed plumbers, is intense, and the process of locating and recruiting skilled employees with the combination of qualifications and attributes required to adequately perform plumbing duties can be difficult and lengthy.  We cannot assure you that Roto-Rooter will be successful in attracting, retaining or training highly skilled personnel.  Roto-Rooter’s business could be disrupted and its growth and profitability negatively impacted if it is unable to attract and retain skilled employees.CybersecurityIn the normal course of business, our information technology systems hold sensitive customer information including names, addresses and partial credit card information.  Additionally, we utilize those same systems to perform our day-to-day activities, such as receiving customer calls, dispatching technicians to jobs and maintaining an accurate record of all transactions.  We have not experienced any known attacks on our information technology systems that compromised customer data or the Company’s proprietary data.  We maintain our information technology systems with  safeguard protection against cyber-attacks including passive intrusion protection, firewalls and virus detection software.  Additionally, on a quarterly basis, we test our information technology systems using  cyber-attack software and methods to learn how a successful attack may be made.  We remedy any issues encountered during these tests.  However, these safeguards do not ensure that a significant cyber-attack could not occur.  A successful attack on our information technology systems could have significant consequences to the business including liability for compromised customer information and business interruption.VITASVitas is highly dependent on payments from Medicare and Medicaid.  If there are changes in the rate or methods governing these payments, Vitas’ net patient service revenue and profits could materially decline.In excess of 90% of Vitas’ net patient service revenue consists of payments from the Medicare and Medicaid programs.  Such payments are made primarily on a “per diem” basis, subject to annual reimbursement caps.  Because Vitas receives a per diem fee to provide eligible services to all patients, Vitas’ profitability is largely dependent upon its ability to manage the costs of providing hospice services to patients.  Increases in operating costs, such as labor and supply costs that are subject to inflation, without a compensating increase in Medicare and Medicaid rates, could have a material adverse effect on Vitas’ business in the future.  Medicare and Medicaid currently adjust the various hospice payment rates annually based primarily on the increase or decrease of the hospital wage index basket, regionally adjusted.  However, the increases may be less than actual inflation.  Vitas’ profitability could be negatively impacted if this adjustment were eliminated or reduced, or if Vitas’ costs of providing hospice services increased more than the annual adjustment.  In addition, cost pressures resulting from shorter patient lengths of stay and the use of more expensive forms of palliative care, including drugs and drug delivery systems, could negatively impact Vitas’ profitability.  Many payors are increasing pressure to control health care costs.  In addition, both public and private payors are increasing pressure to decrease, or limit increases in, reimbursement rates for health care services.  Vitas’ levels of revenue and profitability will be subject to the effect of possible reductions in coverage or payment rates by third-party payors, including payment rates from Medicare and Medicaid.  14   Each state that maintains a Medicaid program has the option to provide reimbursement for hospice services at reimbursement rates generally required to be at least as much as Medicare rates.  All states in which Vitas operates cover Medicaid hospice services; however, we cannot assure you that the states in which Vitas is presently operating or states into which Vitas could expand operations will continue to cover Medicaid hospice services.  In addition, the Medicare and Medicaid programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive and prospective rate and payment adjustments, administrative rulings, freezes and funding reductions, all of which may adversely affect the level of program payments and could have a material adverse effect on Vitas’ business.  We cannot assure that Medicare and/or Medicaid payments to hospices will not decrease.  Reductions in amounts paid by government programs for services or changes in methods or regulations governing payments could cause Vitas’ net patient service revenue and profits to materially decline.Approximately 21% of Vitas’ days of care are provided to patients who reside in nursing homes. Changes in the laws and regulations regarding payments for hospice services and “room and board” provided to Vitas’ hospice patients residing in nursing homes could reduce its net patient service revenue and profitability.For Vitas’ hospice patients receiving nursing home care under certain state Medicaid programs who elect hospice care under Medicare and Medicaid, the state generally must pay Vitas, in addition to the applicable Medicare or Medicaid hospice per diem rate, an amount equal to at least 95% of the Medicaid per diem nursing home rate for “room and board” furnished to the patient by the nursing home.  Vitas contracts with various nursing homes for the nursing homes’ provision of certain “room and board” services that the nursing homes would otherwise provide Medicaid nursing home patients.  Vitas bills and collects from the applicable state Medicaid program an amount equal to approximately 95% of the amount that would otherwise have been paid directly to the nursing home under the state’s Medicaid plan.  Under Vitas’ standard nursing home contracts, it pays the nursing home for these “room and board” services at approximately 100% of the Medicaid per diem nursing home rate.The reduction or elimination of Medicare and Medicaid payments for hospice patients residing in nursing homes would reduce Vitas’ net patient service revenue and profitability.  In addition, changes in the way nursing homes are reimbursed for “room and board” services provided to hospice patients residing in nursing homes could affect Vitas’ ability to serve patients in nursing homes.If Vitas is unable to maintain relationships with existing patient referral sources or to establish new referral sources, Vitas’ growth and profitability could be adversely affected.Vitas’ success is heavily dependent on referrals from physicians, long-term care facilities, hospitals and other institutional health care providers, managed care companies, insurance companies and other patient referral sources in the communities that its hospice locations serve, as well as on its ability to maintain good relations with these referral sources.  Vitas’ referral sources may refer their patients to other hospice care providers or not to a hospice provider at all.  Vitas’ growth and profitability depend significantly on its ability to establish and maintain close working relationships with these patient referral sources and to increase awareness and acceptance of hospice care by its referral sources and their patients.  We cannot assure you that Vitas will be able to maintain its existing relationships or that it will be able to develop and maintain new relationships in existing or new markets.  Vitas’ loss of existing relationships or its failure to develop new relationships could adversely affect its ability to expand or maintain its operations and operate profitably.  Moreover, we cannot assure you that awareness or acceptance of hospice care will increase or remain at current levels.Vitas operates in an industry that is subject to extensive government regulation and claims reviews, and changes in law and regulatory interpretations could reduce its net patient service revenue and profitability and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.  15   The healthcare industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations relating to, among others: ●  Payment for services;●  Conduct of operations, including fraud and abuse, anti-kickback prohibitions, self-referral prohibitions and false claims;●  Privacy and security of medical records;●  Employment practices; and●  Various state approval requirements, such as facility and professional licensure, certificate of need, compliance surveys and other certification or recertification requirements.Changes in these laws, rules and regulations or in interpretations thereof could reduce Vitas’ net patient service revenue and profitability.  Vitas’ ability to comply with such regulations is a key factor in determining the success of its business.  See the “Government Regulations” section of this 10-K for a greater description of these matters.Fraud and Abuse Laws.  Vitas contracts with a significant number of health care providers and practitioners, including physicians, hospitals and nursing homes and arranges for these entities to provide services to Vitas’ patients.  Some of these health care providers and practitioners may refer, or be in a position to refer, patients to Vitas (or Vitas may refer patients to them).  These arrangements may not qualify for a safe harbor.  Vitas from time to time seeks guidance from regulatory counsel as to the changing and evolving interpretations and the potential applicability of the Anti-Kickback Law to its programs, and in response thereto, takes such actions as it deems appropriate.  Vitas generally believes that its contracts and arrangements with providers, practitioners and suppliers should not be found to violate the Anti-Kickback Law.  However, we cannot assure you that such laws will ultimately be interpreted in a manner consistent with Vitas’ practices.Several health care reform proposals have included an expansion of the Anti-Kickback Law to include referrals of any patients regardless of payor source, which is similar to the scope of certain laws that have been enacted at the state level.  In addition, a number of states in which Vitas operates have laws, which vary from state to state, prohibiting certain direct or indirect remuneration or fee-splitting arrangements between health care providers, regardless of payor source, for the referral of patients to a particular provider.The federal Ethics in Patient Referral Act, Section 1877 of the Social Security Act (commonly known as the “Stark Law”) prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients for “designated health services” to entities in which they hold an ownership or investment interest or with whom they have a compensation arrangement, subject to certain statutory or regulatory exceptions.  We cannot assure you that future statutory or regulatory changes will not result in hospice services being subject to the Stark Law’s ownership, investment, compensation or referral prohibitions.  Several states in which Vitas operates have similar laws which likewise are subject to change.  Any such changes could adversely affect the business, financial condition and operating results of Vitas.Further, under separate statutes, submission of claims for items or services that are “not provided as claimed” may lead to civil money penalties, criminal fines and imprisonment and/or exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federally funded state health care programs.  These false claims statutes include the federal False Claims Act, which allows any person to bring suit on behalf of the federal government, known as a qui tam action, alleging false or fraudulent Medicare or Medicaid claims or other violations of the statute and to share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement.  See the discussion of the governmental investigations pending against Vitas under Other Healthcare Regulations, above.Certificate of Need Laws.  Many states, including Florida, have certificate of need laws or other similar health planning laws that apply to hospice care providers.  These states may require some form of state agency review or approval prior to opening a new hospice program, to adding or expanding hospice services, to undertaking significant capital expenditures or under other specified circumstances.  Approval under these certificate of need laws is generally conditioned on the showing of a demonstrable need for services in the community.  Vitas may seek to develop, acquire or expand hospice programs in states having certificate of need laws.  To the extent that state agencies require Vitas to obtain a certificate of need or other similar approvals to expand services at existing hospice programs or to make acquisitions or develop hospice programs in new or existing geographical markets, Vitas’ plans could be adversely affected by a failure to obtain a certificate or approval.  In addition, competitors may seek administratively or judicially to challenge such an approval or proposed approval by the state agency.  Such a challenge, whether or not ultimately successful, could adversely affect Vitas.   16   Other Federal and State Regulations. The federal government and all states regulate various aspects of the hospice industry and Vitas’ business.  In particular, Vitas’ operations are subject to federal and state health regulatory laws, including those covering professional services, the dispensing of drugs and certain types of hospice activities.  Certain of Vitas’ employees are subject to state laws and regulations governing professional practice.  Vitas’ operations are subject to periodic survey by governmental authorities and private accrediting entities to assure compliance with applicable state licensing, and Medicare and Medicaid certification and accreditation standards, as the case may be.  From time to time in the ordinary course of business, Vitas receives survey reports noting deficiencies for alleged failure to comply with applicable requirements.  Vitas reviews such reports and takes appropriate corrective action.  The failure to effect such action could result in one of Vitas’ hospice programs being terminated from the Medicare hospice program.  Any termination of one or more of Vitas’ hospice locations from the Medicare hospice program could adversely affect Vitas’ net patient service revenue and profitability and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.   The failure to obtain, renew or maintain any of the required regulatory approvals, certifications or licenses could materially adversely affect Vitas’ business and could prevent the programs involved from offering products and services to patients.  In addition, laws and regulations often are adopted to regulate new products, services and industries.  We cannot assure you that either the states or the federal government will not impose additional regulations on Vitas’ activities, which might materially adversely affect Vitas, including impairing the value of its brand.Claims Review.  The Medicare and Medicaid programs and their fiscal intermediaries and other payors periodically conduct pre-payment or post-payment reviews and other reviews and audits of health care claims, including hospice claims.  As a result of such reviews or audits, Vitas could be required to return any amounts found to be overpaid, or amounts found to be overpaid could be recouped through reductions in future payments.  There is pressure from state and federal governments and other payors to scrutinize health care claims to determine their validity and appropriateness.  Vitas’ claims have been subject to review and audit.  We cannot assure you that reviews and/or similar audits of Vitas’ claims will not result in material recoupments, denials or other actions that could have a material adverse effect on Vitas’ business, financial condition and results of operations.  See the discussion of OIG investigations pending against Vitas under Other Health Care Regulations, above.Regulation and Provision of Continuous Home Care.  Vitas provides continuous home care to patients requiring such care.  Continuous home care is provided to patients while at home, during periods of crisis when intensive monitoring and care, primarily nursing care, is required in order to achieve palliation or management of acute medical symptoms.  Continuous home care requires a minimum of 8 hours of care within a 24-hour day, which begins and ends at midnight.  The care must be predominantly nursing care provided by either a registered nurse or licensed practical nurse.Continuous home care can be challenging for a hospice to provide for a number of reasons, including the need to have available sufficient skilled and trained staff to furnish such care, the need to manage the staffing and provision of such care, and a shortage of nurses that can make it particularly difficult to attract and retain nurses that are required to furnish a majority of such care.  Medicare reimbursement for continuous home care has been calculated by multiplying the applicable continuous home care hourly rate by the number of hours of care provided.  If the care was provided for less than one hour, Medicare requires reporting in 15-minute increments of care provided, with no rounding.Medicare reimbursement for continuous home care is subject to a number of requirements posing further challenges for a hospice providing such care.  For example, if a patient requires skilled interventions for palliation or symptom management that can be accomplished in less than 8 aggregate hours within the 24-hour period, if the majority of care can be accomplished by someone other than a registered nurse or a licensed practical nurse (e.g., if a majority of care is furnished by a home health aide or homemaker), or if for any reason less than 8 hours of direct care are provided (such as when a patient dies before 8 AM even if 7 or more hours of care has been provided), the care rendered cannot be reimbursed by Medicare at the continuous home care rate (although the care instead may be eligible for Medicare reimbursement at the reduced routine home care day rate).  As a result of such requirements, Vitas may incur the costs of providing services intended to be continuous home care services yet be unable to bill or be reimbursed for such services at the continuous home care rate.  We cannot assure you that challenges in providing continuous home care will not cause Vitas’ net patient service revenue and profits to materially decline or that reviews and/or similar audits of Vitas’ claims will not result in material recoupments, denials or other actions that could have a material adverse effect on Vitas’ business, financial condition and results of operations.Compliance.  Vitas maintains an internal regulatory compliance review program and from time to time retains regulatory counsel for guidance on compliance matters.  We cannot assure you, however, that Vitas’ practices, if reviewed, would be found to be in compliance with applicable health regulatory laws, as such laws ultimately may be interpreted, or that any non-compliance with such laws would not have a material adverse effect on Vitas.  17   Federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives could require Vitas to expend substantial sums on acquiring, implementing and supporting new information systems, which could negatively impact its profitability.There are currently numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives at both the state and federal levels that address patient privacy concerns.  We cannot predict the total financial or other impact of the regulations on Vitas’ operations.  In addition, although Vitas’ management believes it is in compliance with the requirement of patient privacy regulations, we cannot assure you that Vitas will not be found to have violated state and federal laws, rules or guidelines surrounding patient privacy.  Compliance with current and future HIPAA requirements or any other federal or state privacy initiatives could require Vitas to make substantial investments, which could negatively impact its profitability and cash flows.Vitas’ growth strategies may not be successful, which could adversely affect its business.A significant element of Vitas’ growth strategy is expected to include expansion of its business in new and existing markets.  This aspect of Vitas’ growth strategy may not be successful, which could adversely impact its growth and profitability.  We cannot assure you that Vitas will be able to:●  Identify markets that meet its selection criteria for new hospice locations;●  Hire and retain qualified management teams to operate each of its new hospice locations;●  Manage a large and geographically diverse group of hospice locations;●  Become Medicare and Medicaid certified in new markets;●  Generate sufficient hospice admissions in new markets to operate profitably in these new markets;●  Compete effectively with existing hospices in new markets; or●  Obtain state licensure and/or a certificate of need from appropriate state agencies in new markets.In addition to growing existing locations and developing new hospice locations, Vitas’ growth is expected to include expansion through acquisition of other hospices.  We cannot assure you that Vitas’ acquisition strategy will be successful.  The success of Vitas’ acquisition strategy depends upon a number of factors, including: ●  Its ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates; ●  Its ability to negotiate favorable acquisition terms, including purchase price, which may be adversely affected due to increased competition with other buyers;●  The availability of financing on favorable terms, or at all;●  Its ability to integrate effectively the systems and operations of acquired hospices;●  Its ability to retain key personnel of acquired hospices; and●  Its ability to obtain required regulatory approvals.Acquisitions involve a number of other risks, including diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and assuming known or unknown liabilities of acquired hospices, including liabilities for failure to comply with health care laws and regulations.  Integrating acquired hospices may place significant strains on Vitas’ current operating and financial systems and controls.  Vitas may not successfully overcome these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with its acquisition strategy.In addition, since 1990, Vitas has acquired hospice programs, some of which involved acquisitions of hospice programs from not-for-profit entities.  Vitas believes that acquisitions of not-for-profit programs are generally more complex than acquisitions from for-profit entities and that a substantial number of acquisition opportunities are likely to involve acquisitions from not-for-profit entities.  Such acquisitions are subject to provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and, in certain states, state attorney general powers, which have been interpreted to require that the consideration paid for the assets purchased be at fair market value and, where applicable, that any fees paid for services be reasonable.  In many states there is no mechanism for state attorney general pre-clearance of transactions to assure that applicable standards have been met.  Entities that acquired not-for-profit hospices could face potential liability if the acquisition transaction is not structured to comply with Internal Revenue Code and state law requirements, and in some cases the transaction could be enjoined or subject to rescission.  The acquisition of not-for-profit businesses, including the fairness of the purchase price paid, has received increasing regulatory scrutiny by state attorneys general and other regulatory authorities.  Although Vitas believes that reasonable actions have been taken to date to establish the fair market value of assets purchased in prior acquisitions of hospice operations from not-for-profit entities and the reasonableness of fees paid for services, we cannot assure you that such transactions or any future similar transactions will not be challenged or that, if challenged, the results of such challenge would not have a material adverse effect on Vitas’ business.  18   Vitas’ loss of key management personnel or its inability to hire and retain skilled employees could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.Vitas’ future success significantly depends upon the continued service of its senior management personnel.  The loss of one or more of Vitas’ key senior management personnel or its inability to hire and retain new skilled employees could negatively impact Vitas’ ability to maintain or increase patient referrals, a key aspect of its growth strategy, and could adversely affect its future operating results.Competition for skilled employees is intense, and the process of locating and recruiting skilled employees with the combination of qualifications and attributes required to care effectively for terminally ill patients and their families can be difficult and lengthy.  We cannot assure you that Vitas will be successful in attracting, retaining or training highly skilled nursing, management, community education, operations, admissions and other personnel.  Vitas’ business could be disrupted and its growth and profitability negatively impacted if it is unable to attract and retain skilled employees. A nationwide shortage of qualified nurses could adversely affect Vitas’ profitability, growth and ability to continue to provide quality, responsive hospice services to its patients as nursing wages and benefits increase.The substantial majority of Vitas’ workforce is nurses.  Vitas depends on qualified nurses to provide quality, responsive hospice services to its patients.  The current nationwide shortage of qualified nurses impacts some of the markets in which Vitas provides hospice services.  In response to this shortage, Vitas has adjusted its wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and to engage contract nurses.  Vitas’ inability to attract and retain qualified nurses could adversely affect its ability to provide quality, responsive hospice services to its patients and its ability to increase or maintain patient census in those markets.  Increases in the wages and benefits required to attract and retain qualified nurses or an increase in reliance on contract nurses could negatively impact profitability.Vitas may not be able to compete successfully against other hospice providers, and competitive pressures may limit its ability to maintain or increase its market position and adversely affect its profitability, financial condition and results of operations.Hospice care in the United States is highly competitive.  In many areas in which Vitas’ hospices are located, they compete with a large number of organizations, including: ● Community-based hospice providers; ● National and regional companies; ● Hospital-based hospice and palliative care programs; ● Physician groups; ● Nursing homes; ● Home health agencies; ● Infusion therapy companies; and ● Nursing agencies.  19   Various health care companies have diversified into the hospice market.  Other companies, including hospitals and health care organizations that are not currently providing hospice care, may enter the markets Vitas serves and expand the variety of services offered to include hospice care.  We cannot assure you that Vitas will not encounter increased competition in the future that could limit its ability to maintain or increase its market position, including competition from parties in a position to impact referrals to Vitas.  Such increased competition could have a material adverse effect on Vitas’ business, financial condition and results of operations.Changes in rates or methods of payment for Vitas’ services could adversely affect its revenues and profits.Managed care organizations have grown substantially in terms of the percentage of the population they cover and their control over an increasing portion of the health care economy.  Managed care organizations have continued to consolidate to enhance their ability to influence the delivery of health care services and to exert pressure to control health care costs.  Vitas has a number of contractual arrangements with managed care organizations and other similar parties.Vitas provides hospice care to many Medicare beneficiaries who receive their non-hospice health care services from health maintenance organizations (“HMOs”) under Medicare risk contracts.  Under such contracts between HMOs and the federal Department of Health and Human Services, the Medicare payments for hospice services are excluded from the per-member, per-month payment from Medicare to HMOs and instead are paid directly by Medicare to the hospices.  As a result, Vitas’ payments for Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare risk HMOs are processed in the same way with the same rates as other Medicare beneficiaries.  We cannot assure, however, that payment for hospice services will continue to be excluded from HMO payment under Medicare risk contracts and similar Medicare managed care plans or that if not excluded, managed care organizations or other large third-party payors would not use their power to influence and exert pressure on health care providers to reduce costs in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on Vitas’ business, financial condition and results of operations.Liability claims may have an adverse effect on Vitas, and its insurance coverage may be inadequate.Participants in the hospice industry are subject to lawsuits alleging negligence, product liability or other similar legal theories, many of which involve large claims and significant defense costs.  From time to time, Vitas is subject to such and other types of lawsuits.  See the description below under Legal Proceedings.  The ultimate liability for claims, if any, could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or operating results.  Although Vitas currently maintains liability insurance intended to cover the claims, we cannot assure you that the coverage limits of such insurance policies will be adequate or that all such claims will be covered by the insurance.  In addition, Vitas’ insurance policies must be renewed annually and may be subject to cancellation during the policy period.  While Vitas has been able to obtain liability insurance in the past, such insurance varies in cost,  and may not be available in the future on terms acceptable to Vitas, if at all.A successful claim in excess of the insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on Vitas.  Claims, regardless of their merit or eventual outcome, also may have a material adverse effect on Vitas’ business and reputation due to the costs of litigation, diversion of management’s time and related publicity.Vitas procures professional liability coverage on a claims-made basis.  The insurance contracts specify that coverage is available only during the term of each insurance contract.  Vitas’ management intends to renew or replace the existing claims-made policy annually but such coverage is difficult to obtain, may be subject to cancellation and may be written by carriers that are unable, or unwilling to pay claims.  During fiscal 2001, Vitas was notified that one of its prior carriers was ordered into rehabilitation, and in early fiscal 2002, into liquidation, creating the possibility that certain prior year claims could be underinsured or uninsured.  Certain claims have been asserted where the coverage would be the responsibility of this prior carrier and/or other carriers that may not have the financial wherewithal to satisfy the claims.  Additionally, some risks and liabilities, including claims for punitive damages, are not covered by insurance.CybersecurityIn the normal course of business, our information technology systems hold sensitive patient information including patient demographic data, eligibility for various medical plans including Medicare and Medicaid and protected health information.  Additionally, we utilize those same systems to perform our day-to-day activities, such as receiving referrals, assigning medical teams to patients, documenting medical information and maintaining an accurate record of all transactions.  We have not experienced any known attacks on our information technology systems that have compromised patient data or the Company’s proprietary data.  We maintain our information technology systems with  safeguard protection against cyber-attacks including passive intrusion protection, firewalls and virus detection software.  As discussed previously, we are subject to and comply with HIPPA regulations.  However, these safeguards do not ensure that a significant cyber-attack could not occur.  A successful attack on our information technology systems could have significant consequences to the business including liability for compromised patient information and business interruption.  20   "
2,CHE,CHEMED CORP,2012-02-27,"  Risk Factors
You should carefully consider the risks described below.  They are not the only ones facing the Company.  Other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. GENERALWe have incurred debt to finance the operations of the Company.The Company has debt service obligations that may restrict our operating flexibility.  We cannot assure you that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to service our debt, which may require us to borrow additional funds, or restructure or otherwise refinance our debt.  In addition, the Company has the ability to expand its debt and borrowing capacity subject to various restrictions and covenants defined by its creditors.  The interest rate the Company pays will fluctuate from time to time based upon a number of factors including current LIBOR rates and Company operating performance.  Significant changes in these factors could result in a material change in the Company’s interest expense.Our indebtedness could have important consequences for our business.  Among other things, our indebtedness may:●      Limit our ability to obtain additional financing;●      Limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the markets in which we compete;●      Place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with less indebtedness;●      Increase our exposure to interest rate increases due to variable interest rates on certain borrowings;●      Limit our ability to complete future acquisitions;●      Limit our ability to make capital expenditures;●      Render us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and●      Require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to service and repay our debt.Servicing our indebtedness will require a significant amount of cash, and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.Our ability to repay or to refinance our indebtedness and to pay interest on our indebtedness will depend on our operating performance, which may be affected by factors beyond our control.  These factors could include operating difficulties, increased operating costs, our competitors’ actions and regulatory developments.  Our ability to meet our debt service and other obligations may depend in significant part on the extent to which we successfully implement our business strategy.  We cannot assure you that we will be able to implement our strategy fully or that the anticipated results of our strategy will be realized.  Current credit market conditions may make it difficult for us to obtain new financing or refinance our current debt on terms and conditions acceptable to us.If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional equity capital or restructure our debt.  We cannot assure you that our cash flows and capital resources will be sufficient to make scheduled payments of  14   principal and interest on our indebtedness in the future or that alternative measures would successfully meet our debt service obligations. As certain of our obligations under our credit facilities and certain other borrowings could bear interest at floating rates, an increase in interest rates could further increase our debt service costs and adversely affect our cash flows.We have debt that is convertible into shares based on the Company’s stock price.  This could significantly dilute the ownership percentage of current stockholders.The agreements and instruments governing our outstanding debt contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly impact our ability to operate our business and adversely affect the price of our Capital Stock.The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our instruments of indebtedness restrict our ability to: ●      Incur additional debt;●      Issue and sell capital stock of subsidiaries;●      Sell assets;●      Engage in transactions with affiliates;●      Restrict distributions from subsidiaries;●      Incur liens;●      Engage in business other than permitted businesses;●      Engage in sale/leaseback transactions;●      Engage in mergers or consolidations;●      Make capital expenditures;●      Make guarantees;●      Make investments and acquisitions;●      Enter into operating leases;●      Hedge interest rates; and●      Prepay other debt. Moreover, if we are unable to meet the terms of the financial covenants or if we breach any of these covenants, a default could result under one or more of these agreements.  A default, if not waived by our lenders, could accelerate repayment of our outstanding indebtedness.  If acceleration occurs, we may not be able to repay our  15   debt and it is unlikely that we would be able to borrow sufficient additional funds to refinance such debt on acceptable terms.  In the event of any default under our credit facilities, the lenders thereunder could elect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, to be due and payable, and to require us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings, any of which would be an event of default. We depend on our management team and the loss of their service could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of our executive management team.  The loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, we cannot assure you that we will be able to attract or retain other skilled personnel in the future.Environmental compliance costs and liabilities could increase our expenses and adversely affect our financial condition.Our operations are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that prohibit or restrict the discharge of pollutants into the environment and regulate employee exposure to hazardous substance in the workplace.  Failure to comply with these laws could subject us to material costs and liabilities, including civil and criminal fines, costs to cleanup contamination we cause and, in some circumstances, costs to cleanup contamination we discover on our own property but did not cause.Because we use and generate hazardous materials in some of our operations, we are potentially subject to material liabilities relating to the cleanup of contamination and personal injury claims.  In addition, we have retained certain environmental liabilities in connection with the sale of former businesses.  We are currently funding the cleanup of historical contamination at one of our former properties and contributing to the cleanup of third-party sites as a result of our sale of our former subsidiary DuBois Chemicals Inc.  Although we have established a reserve for these liabilities, actual cleanup costs may exceed our current estimates due to factors beyond our control, such as the discovery of additional contamination or the enforcement of more stringent cleanup requirements.  New laws and regulations or their stricter enforcement, the discovery of presently unknown conditions or the receipt of additional claims for indemnification could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities including impairment of our brand that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to certain anti-takeover statutes that might make it more difficult to effect a change in control of the Company.We are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits us from engaging in a “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.  The application of Section 203 could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control that could be advantageous to stockholders.An adverse ruling against us in certain litigation could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.We are involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of our business currently and from time to time.  The damages claimed against us in some of these cases are substantial.See the “Legal Proceedings” sections of this 10-K for discussion of particular matters.  16   We cannot assure you that we will prevail in pending cases.  Regardless of the outcome, such litigation is costly to manage, investigate and defend, and the related defense costs, diversion of management’s time and related publicity may adversely affect the conduct of our business and the results of our operations. ROTO-ROOTERWe face intense competition from numerous, fragmented competitors.  If we do not compete effectively, our business may suffer.We face intense competition from numerous competitors, many of whom have less leverage than we do.  The sewer, drain and pipe cleaning, and plumbing repair businesses are highly fragmented, with the bulk of the industries consisting of local and regional competitors.  We compete primarily on the basis of advertising, range of services provided, name recognition, availability of emergency service, speed and quality of customer service, service guarantees and pricing.  Our competitors may succeed in developing new or enhanced products and services more successful than ours and in marketing and selling existing and new products and services better than we do.  In addition, new competitors may emerge.  We cannot make any assurances that we will continue to be able to compete successfully with any of these companies.Our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations, exposing us to potential claims and compliance costs that could adversely affect our business.We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to franchising, insurance and other aspects of our business.  These are discussed in greater detail under “Government Regulations” in the Description of Business section hereof.  If we fail to comply with existing or future laws and regulations, we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines and sanctions.  Our franchising activities are subject to various federal and state franchising laws and regulations, including the rules and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) regarding the offering or sale of franchises.  The rules and regulations of the FTC require us to provide all of our prospective franchisees with specific information regarding us and our franchise program in the form of a detailed franchise offering circular.  In addition, a number of states require us to register our franchise offering prior to offering or selling franchises in such states.  Various state laws also provide for certain rights in favor of franchisees, including (i) limitations on the franchisor’s ability to terminate a franchise except for good cause, (ii) restrictions on the franchisor’s ability to deny renewal of a franchise, (iii) circumstances under which the franchisor may be required to purchase certain inventory of franchisees when a franchise is terminated or not renewed in violation of such laws and (iv) provisions relating to arbitration.  The ability to engage in the plumbing repair business is also subject to certain limitations and restrictions imposed by the state and local licensing laws and regulations.   We cannot predict what legislation or regulations affecting our business will be enacted in the future, how existing or future laws or regulations will be enforced, administered and interpreted, or the amount of future expenditures that may be required to comply with these laws or regulations.  Compliance costs associated with governmental regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Roto-Rooter’s loss of key management personnel or its inability to hire and retain skilled employees could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.Roto-Rooter’s future success significantly depends upon the continued service of its senior management personnel.  The loss of one or more of Roto-Rooter’s key senior management personnel or its inability to hire and retain new skilled employees could negatively impact its ability to maintain or increase customer calls and jobs, a key aspect of its growth strategy, and could adversely affect its future operating results.Competition for skilled employees, particularly related to licensed plumbers, is intense, and the process of locating and recruiting skilled employees with the combination of qualifications and attributes required to adequately perform plumbing duties can be difficult and lengthy.  We cannot assure you that Roto-Rooter will be successful in attracting, retaining or training highly skilled personnel.  Roto-Rooter’s business could be disrupted and its growth and profitability negatively impacted if it is unable to attract and retain skilled employees.   17   CybersecurityIn the normal course of business, our information technology systems hold sensitive customer information including names, addresses and partial credit card information.  Additionally, we utilize those same systems to perform our day-to-day activities, such as receiving customer calls, dispatching technicians to jobs and maintaining an accurate record of all transactions.  We have not experienced any attacks on our information technology systems that compromised customer data or the Company’s proprietary data.  We maintain our information technology systems with up to date safeguard protection against cyber-attacks including passive intrusion protection, firewalls and virus detection software.  Additionally, on a quarterly basis, we test our information technology systems using the latest cyber-attack software and methods to learn how a successful attack may be made.  We remedy any issues encountered during these tests.  However, these safeguards do not ensure that a significant cyber-attack could not occur.  A successful attack on our information technology systems could have significantly negative consequences to the business including liability for compromised customer information and business interruption.VITASVitas is highly dependent on payments from Medicare and Medicaid.  If there are changes in the rate or methods governing these payments, Vitas’ net patient service revenue and profits could materially decline.In excess of 90% of Vitas’ net patient service revenue consists of payments from the Medicare and Medicaid programs.  Such payments are made primarily on a “per diem” basis, subject to annual reimbursement caps.  Because Vitas receives a per diem fee to provide eligible services to all patients, Vitas’ profitability is largely dependent upon its ability to manage the costs of providing hospice services to patients.  Increases in operating costs, such as labor and supply costs that are subject to inflation, without a compensating increase in Medicare and Medicaid rates, could have a material adverse effect on Vitas’ business in the future.  Medicare and Medicaid currently adjust the various hospice payment rates annually based primarily on the increase or decrease of the hospital wage index basket, regionally adjusted.  However, the increases may be less than actual inflation.  Vitas’ profitability could be negatively impacted if this adjustment were eliminated or reduced, or if Vitas’ costs of providing hospice services increased more than the annual adjustment.  In addition, cost pressures resulting from shorter patient lengths of stay and the use of more expensive forms of palliative care, including drugs and drug delivery systems, could negatively impact Vitas’ profitability.  Many payors are increasing pressure to control health care costs.  In addition, both public and private payors are increasing pressure to decrease, or limit increases in, reimbursement rates for health care services.  Vitas’ levels of revenue and profitability will be subject to the effect of possible reductions in coverage or payment rates by third-party payors, including payment rates from Medicare and Medicaid.Each state that maintains a Medicaid program has the option to provide reimbursement for hospice services at reimbursement rates generally required to be at least as much as Medicare rates.  All states in which Vitas operates cover Medicaid hospice services; however, we cannot assure you that the states in which Vitas is presently operating or states into which Vitas could expand operations will continue to cover Medicaid hospice services.  In addition, the Medicare and Medicaid programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive and prospective rate and payment adjustments, administrative rulings, freezes and funding reductions, all of which may adversely affect the level of program payments and could have a material adverse effect on Vitas’ business.  We cannot assure that Medicare and/or Medicaid payments to hospices will not decrease.  Reductions in amounts paid by government programs for services or changes in methods or regulations governing payments could cause Vitas’ net patient service revenue and profits to materially decline.Approximately 23% of Vitas’ hospice patients reside in nursing homes. Changes in the laws and regulations regarding payments for hospice services and “room and board” provided to Vitas’ hospice patients residing in nursing homes could reduce its net patient service revenue and profitability.  18   For Vitas’ hospice patients receiving nursing home care under certain state Medicaid programs who elect hospice care under Medicare and Medicaid, the state generally must pay Vitas, in addition to the applicable Medicare or Medicaid hospice per diem rate, an amount equal to at least 95% of the Medicaid per diem nursing home rate for “room and board” furnished to the patient by the nursing home.  Vitas contracts with various nursing homes for the nursing homes’ provision of certain “room and board” services that the nursing homes would otherwise provide Medicaid nursing home patients.  Vitas bills and collects from the applicable state Medicaid program an amount equal to approximately 95% of the amount that would otherwise have been paid directly to the nursing home under the state’s Medicaid plan.  Under Vitas’ standard nursing home contracts, it pays the nursing home for these “room and board” services at approximately 100% of the Medicaid per diem nursing home rate.The reduction or elimination of Medicare and Medicaid payments for hospice patients residing in nursing homes would reduce Vitas’ net patient service revenue and profitability.  In addition, changes in the way nursing homes are reimbursed for “room and board” services provided to hospice patients residing in nursing homes could affect Vitas’ ability to serve patients in nursing homes.If Vitas is unable to maintain relationships with existing patient referral sources or to establish new referral sources, Vitas’ growth and profitability could be adversely affected.Vitas’ success is heavily dependent on referrals from physicians, long-term care facilities, hospitals and other institutional health care providers, managed care companies, insurance companies and other patient referral sources in the communities that its hospice locations serve, as well as on its ability to maintain good relations with these referral sources.  Vitas’ referral sources may refer their patients to other hospice care providers or not to a hospice provider at all.  Vitas’ growth and profitability depend significantly on its ability to establish and maintain close working relationships with these patient referral sources and to increase awareness and acceptance of hospice care by its referral sources and their patients.  We cannot assure you that Vitas will be able to maintain its existing relationships or that it will be able to develop and maintain new relationships in existing or new markets.  Vitas’ loss of existing relationships or its failure to develop new relationships could adversely affect its ability to expand or maintain its operations and operate profitably.  Moreover, we cannot assure you that awareness or acceptance of hospice care will increase or remain at current levels.Vitas operates in an industry that is subject to extensive government regulation and claims reviews, and changes in law and regulatory interpretations could reduce its net patient service revenue and profitability and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.The healthcare industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations relating to, among others: ●      Payment for services;●      Conduct of operations, including fraud and abuse, anti-kickback prohibitions, self-referral prohibitions and false claims;●      Privacy and security of medical records;●      Employment practices; and●      Various state approval requirements, such as facility and professional licensure, certificate of need, compliance surveys and other certification or recertification requirements.Changes in these laws, rules and regulations or in interpretations thereof could reduce Vitas’ net patient service revenue and profitability.  Vitas’ ability to comply with such regulations is a key factor in determining the  19   success of its business.  See the “Government Regulations” section of this 10-K for a greater description of these matters. Fraud and Abuse Laws.  Vitas contracts with a significant number of health care providers and practitioners, including physicians, hospitals and nursing homes and arranges for these entities to provide services to Vitas’ patients.  Some of these health care providers and practitioners may refer, or be in a position to refer, patients to Vitas (or Vitas may refer patients to them).  These arrangements may not qualify for a safe harbor.  Vitas from time to time seeks guidance from regulatory counsel as to the changing and evolving interpretations and the potential applicability of the Anti-Kickback Law to its programs, and in response thereto, takes such actions as it deems appropriate.  Vitas generally believes that its contracts and arrangements with providers, practitioners and suppliers should not be found to violate the Anti-Kickback Law.  However, we cannot assure you that such laws will ultimately be interpreted in a manner consistent with Vitas’ practices.Several health care reform proposals have included an expansion of the Anti-Kickback Law to include referrals of any patients regardless of payor source, which is similar to the scope of certain laws that have been enacted at the state level.  In addition, a number of states in which Vitas operates have laws, which vary from state to state, prohibiting certain direct or indirect remuneration or fee-splitting arrangements between health care providers, regardless of payor source, for the referral of patients to a particular provider.The federal Ethics in Patient Referral Act, Section 1877 of the Social Security Act (commonly known as the “Stark Law”) prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients for “designated health services” to entities in which they hold an ownership or investment interest or with whom they have a compensation arrangement, subject to certain statutory or regulatory exceptions.  We cannot assure you that future statutory or regulatory changes will not result in hospice services being subject to the Stark Law’s ownership, investment, compensation or referral prohibitions.  Several states in which Vitas operates have similar laws which likewise are subject to change.  Any such changes could adversely affect the business, financial condition and operating results of Vitas.Further, under separate statutes, submission of claims for items or services that are “not provided as claimed” may lead to civil money penalties, criminal fines and imprisonment and/or exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federally funded state health care programs.  These false claims statutes include the federal False Claims Act, which allows any person to bring suit on behalf of the federal government, known as a qui tam action, alleging false or fraudulent Medicare or Medicaid claims or other violations of the statute and to share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement.  See the discussion of the governmental investigations pending against Vitas under Other Healthcare Regulations, above.Certificate of Need Laws.  Many states, including Florida, have certificate of need laws or other similar health planning laws that apply to hospice care providers.  These states may require some form of state agency review or approval prior to opening a new hospice program, to adding or expanding hospice services, to undertaking significant capital expenditures or under other specified circumstances.  Approval under these certificate of need laws is generally conditioned on the showing of a demonstrable need for services in the community.  Vitas may seek to develop, acquire or expand hospice programs in states having certificate of need laws.  To the extent that state agencies require Vitas to obtain a certificate of need or other similar approvals to expand services at existing hospice programs or to make acquisitions or develop hospice programs in new or existing geographical markets, Vitas’ plans could be adversely affected by a failure to obtain a certificate or approval.  In addition, competitors may seek administratively or judicially to challenge such an approval or proposed approval by the state agency.  Such a challenge, whether or not ultimately successful, could adversely affect Vitas. Other Federal and State Regulations. The federal government and all states regulate various aspects of the hospice industry and Vitas’ business.  In particular, Vitas’ operations are subject to federal and state health regulatory laws, including those covering professional services, the dispensing of drugs and certain types of hospice activities.  Certain of Vitas’ employees are subject to state laws and regulations governing professional practice.  20   Vitas’ operations are subject to periodic survey by governmental authorities and private accrediting entities to assure compliance with applicable state licensing, and Medicare and Medicaid certification and accreditation standards, as the case may be.  From time to time in the ordinary course of business, Vitas receives survey reports noting deficiencies for alleged failure to comply with applicable requirements.  Vitas reviews such reports and takes appropriate corrective action.  The failure to effect such action could result in one of Vitas’ hospice programs being terminated from the Medicare hospice program.  Any termination of one or more of Vitas’ hospice locations from the Medicare hospice program could adversely affect Vitas’ net patient service revenue and profitability and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.   The failure to obtain, renew or maintain any of the required regulatory approvals, certifications or licenses could materially adversely affect Vitas’ business and could prevent the programs involved from offering products and services to patients.  In addition, laws and regulations often are adopted to regulate new products, services and industries.  We cannot assure you that either the states or the federal government will not impose additional regulations on Vitas’ activities, which might materially adversely affect Vitas, including impairing the value of its brand. Claims Review.  The Medicare and Medicaid programs and their fiscal intermediaries and other payors periodically conduct pre-payment or post-payment reviews and other reviews and audits of health care claims, including hospice claims.  As a result of such reviews or audits, Vitas could be required to return any amounts found to be overpaid, or amounts found to be overpaid could be recouped through reductions in future payments.  There is pressure from state and federal governments and other payors to scrutinize health care claims to determine their validity and appropriateness.  Vitas’ claims have been subject to review and audit.  We cannot assure you that reviews and/or similar audits of Vitas’ claims will not result in material recoupments, denials or other actions that could have a material adverse effect on Vitas’ business, financial condition and results of operations.  See the discussion of OIG investigations pending against Vitas under Other Health Care Regulations, above.Regulation and Provision of Continuous Home Care.  Vitas provides continuous home care to patients requiring such care.  Continuous home care is provided to patients while at home, during periods of crisis when intensive monitoring and care, primarily nursing care, is required in order to achieve palliation or management of acute medical symptoms.  Continuous home care requires a minimum of 8 hours of care within a 24-hour day, which begins and ends at midnight.  The care must be predominantly nursing care provided by either a registered nurse or licensed practical nurse.Continuous home care can be challenging for a hospice to provide for a number of reasons, including the need to have available sufficient skilled and trained staff to furnish such care, the need to manage the staffing and provision of such care, and a shortage of nurses that can make it particularly difficult to attract and retain nurses that are required to furnish a majority of such care.  Medicare reimbursement for continuous home care has been calculated by multiplying the applicable continuous home care hourly rate by the number of hours of care provided.  If the care was provided for less than one hour, Medicare requires reporting in 15-minute increments of care provided, with no rounding.Medicare reimbursement for continuous home care is subject to a number of requirements posing further challenges for a hospice providing such care.  For example, if a patient requires skilled interventions for palliation or symptom management that can be accomplished in less than 8 aggregate hours within the 24-hour period, if the majority of care can be accomplished by someone other than a registered nurse or a licensed practical nurse (e.g., if a majority of care is furnished by a home health aide or homemaker), or if for any reason less than 8 hours of direct care are provided (such as when a patient dies before 8 AM even if 7 or more hours of care has been provided), the care rendered cannot be reimbursed by Medicare at the continuous home care rate (although the care instead may be eligible for Medicare reimbursement at the reduced routine home care day rate).  As a result of such requirements, Vitas may incur the costs of providing services intended to be continuous home care services yet be unable to bill or be reimbursed for such services at the continuous home care rate.  We cannot assure you that challenges in providing continuous home care will not cause Vitas’ net patient service revenue and profits to materially decline or that reviews and/or similar audits of Vitas’ claims will not result in material recoupments, denials or other actions that could have a material adverse effect on Vitas’ business, financial condition and results of operations.   21   Compliance.  Vitas maintains an internal regulatory compliance review program and from time to time retains regulatory counsel for guidance on compliance matters.  We cannot assure you, however, that Vitas’ practices, if reviewed, would be found to be in compliance with applicable health regulatory laws, as such laws ultimately may be interpreted, or that any non-compliance with such laws would not have a material adverse effect on Vitas.Federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives could require Vitas to expend substantial sums on acquiring, implementing and supporting new information systems, which could negatively impact its profitability.There are currently numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives at both the state and federal levels that address patient privacy concerns.  We cannot predict the total financial or other impact of the regulations on Vitas’ operations.  In addition, although Vitas’ management believes it is in compliance with the requirement of patient privacy regulations, we cannot assure you that Vitas will not be found to have violated state and federal laws, rules or guidelines surrounding patient privacy.  Compliance with current and future HIPAA requirements or any other federal or state privacy initiatives could require Vitas to make substantial investments, which could negatively impact its profitability and cash flows.Vitas’ growth strategies may not be successful, which could adversely affect its business.A significant element of Vitas’ growth strategy is expected to include expansion of its business in new and existing markets.  This aspect of Vitas’ growth strategy may not be successful, which could adversely impact its growth and profitability.  We cannot assure you that Vitas will be able to:●   Identify markets that meet its selection criteria for new hospice locations;●   Hire and retain qualified management teams to operate each of its new hospice locations;●   Manage a large and geographically diverse group of hospice locations;●   Become Medicare and Medicaid certified in new markets;●   Generate sufficient hospice admissions in new markets to operate profitably in these new markets;●   Compete effectively with existing hospices in new markets; or●   Obtain state licensure and/or a certificate of need from appropriate state agencies in new markets.In addition to growing existing locations and developing new hospice locations, Vitas’ growth is expected to include expansion through acquisition of other hospices.  We cannot assure you that Vitas’ acquisition strategy will be successful.  The success of Vitas’ acquisition strategy depends upon a number of factors, including: ●   Its ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates; ●   Its ability to negotiate favorable acquisition terms, including purchase price, which may be adversely affected due to increased competition with other buyers;●   The availability of financing on favorable terms, or at all;●   Its ability to integrate effectively the systems and operations of acquired hospices;   22   ●   Its ability to retain key personnel of acquired hospices; and●   Its ability to obtain required regulatory approvals. Acquisitions involve a number of other risks, including diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns and assuming known or unknown liabilities of acquired hospices, including liabilities for failure to comply with health care laws and regulations.  Integrating acquired hospices may place significant strains on Vitas’ current operating and financial systems and controls.  Vitas may not successfully overcome these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with its acquisition strategy.In addition, since 1990, Vitas has acquired hospice programs, some of which involved acquisitions of hospice programs from not-for-profit entities.  Vitas believes that acquisitions of not-for-profit programs are generally more complex than acquisitions from for-profit entities and that a substantial number of acquisition opportunities are likely to involve acquisitions from not-for-profit entities.  Such acquisitions are subject to provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and, in certain states, state attorney general powers, which have been interpreted to require that the consideration paid for the assets purchased be at fair market value and, where applicable, that any fees paid for services be reasonable.  In many states there is no mechanism for state attorney general pre-clearance of transactions to assure that applicable standards have been met.  Entities that acquired not-for-profit hospices could face potential liability if the acquisition transaction is not structured to comply with Internal Revenue Code and state law requirements, and in some cases the transaction could be enjoined or subject to rescission.  The acquisition of not-for-profit businesses, including the fairness of the purchase price paid, has received increasing regulatory scrutiny by state attorneys general and other regulatory authorities.  Although Vitas believes that reasonable actions have been taken to date to establish the fair market value of assets purchased in prior acquisitions of hospice operations from not-for-profit entities and the reasonableness of fees paid for services, we cannot assure you that such transactions or any future similar transactions will not be challenged or that, if challenged, the results of such challenge would not have a material adverse effect on Vitas’ business.Vitas’ loss of key management personnel or its inability to hire and retain skilled employees could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.Vitas’ future success significantly depends upon the continued service of its senior management personnel.  The loss of one or more of Vitas’ key senior management personnel or its inability to hire and retain new skilled employees could negatively impact Vitas’ ability to maintain or increase patient referrals, a key aspect of its growth strategy, and could adversely affect its future operating results.Competition for skilled employees is intense, and the process of locating and recruiting skilled employees with the combination of qualifications and attributes required to care effectively for terminally ill patients and their families can be difficult and lengthy.  We cannot assure you that Vitas will be successful in attracting, retaining or training highly skilled nursing, management, community education, operations, admissions and other personnel.  Vitas’ business could be disrupted and its growth and profitability negatively impacted if it is unable to attract and retain skilled employees.A nationwide shortage of qualified nurses could adversely affect Vitas’ profitability, growth and ability to continue to provide quality, responsive hospice services to its patients as nursing wages and benefits increase.The substantial majority of Vitas’ workforce is nurses.  Vitas depends on qualified nurses to provide quality, responsive hospice services to its patients.  The current nationwide shortage of qualified nurses impacts some of the markets in which Vitas provides hospice services.  In response to this shortage, Vitas has adjusted its wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and to engage contract nurses.  Vitas’ inability to attract and retain qualified nurses could adversely affect its ability to provide quality, responsive hospice services to its patients and its ability to increase or maintain patient census in those markets.  Increases in the wages and benefits required to attract and retain qualified nurses or an increase in reliance on contract nurses could negatively impact profitability.   23   Vitas may not be able to compete successfully against other hospice providers, and competitive pressures may limit its ability to maintain or increase its market position and adversely affect its profitability, financial condition and results of operations.Hospice care in the United States is highly competitive.  In many areas in which Vitas’ hospices are located, they compete with a large number of organizations, including: ●      Community-based hospice providers;●      National and regional companies;●      Hospital-based hospice and palliative care programs;●      Physician groups;●      Nursing homes;●      Home health agencies;●      Infusion therapy companies; and●      Nursing agencies. Various health care companies have diversified into the hospice market.  Other companies, including hospitals and health care organizations that are not currently providing hospice care, may enter the markets Vitas serves and expand the variety of services offered to include hospice care.  We cannot assure you that Vitas will not encounter increased competition in the future that could limit its ability to maintain or increase its market position, including competition from parties in a position to impact referrals to Vitas.  Such increased competition could have a material adverse effect on Vitas’ business, financial condition and results of operations.Changes in rates or methods of payment for Vitas’ services could adversely affect its revenues and profits.Managed care organizations have grown substantially in terms of the percentage of the population they cover and their control over an increasing portion of the health care economy.  Managed care organizations have continued to consolidate to enhance their ability to influence the delivery of health care services and to exert pressure to control health care costs.  Vitas has a number of contractual arrangements with managed care organizations and other similar parties.Vitas provides hospice care to many Medicare beneficiaries who receive their non-hospice health care services from health maintenance organizations (“HMOs”) under Medicare risk contracts.  Under such contracts between HMOs and the federal Department of Health and Human Services, the Medicare payments for hospice services are excluded from the per-member, per-month payment from Medicare to HMOs and instead are paid directly by Medicare to the hospices.  As a result, Vitas’ payments for Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare risk HMOs are processed in the same way with the same rates as other Medicare beneficiaries.  We cannot assure, however, that payment for hospice services will continue to be excluded from HMO payment under Medicare risk contracts and similar Medicare managed care plans or that if not excluded, managed care organization or other large third-party payors would not use their power to influence and exert pressure on health care providers to reduce costs in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on Vitas’ business, financial condition and results of operations.  24   Liability claims may have an adverse effect on Vitas, and its insurance coverage may be inadequate.Participants in the hospice industry are subject to lawsuits alleging negligence, product liability or other similar legal theories, many of which involve large claims and significant defense costs.  From time to time, Vitas is subject to such and other types of lawsuits.  See the description below under Legal Proceedings.  The ultimate liability for claims, if any, could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or operating results.  Although Vitas currently maintains liability insurance intended to cover the claims, we cannot assure you that the coverage limits of such insurance policies will be adequate or that all such claims will be covered by the insurance.  In addition, Vitas’ insurance policies must be renewed annually and may be subject to cancellation during the policy period.  While Vitas has been able to obtain liability insurance in the past, such insurance varies in cost, is difficult to obtain and may not be available in the future on terms acceptable to Vitas, if at all.A successful claim in excess of the insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on Vitas.  Claims, regardless of their merit or eventual outcome, also may have a material adverse effect on Vitas’ business and reputation due to the costs of litigation, diversion of management’s time and related publicity.Vitas procures professional liability coverage on a claims-made basis.  The insurance contracts specify that coverage is available only during the term of each insurance contract.  Vitas’ management intends to renew or replace the existing claims-made policy annually but such coverage is difficult to obtain, may be subject to cancellation and may be written by carriers that are unable, or unwilling to pay claims.  During fiscal 2001, Vitas was notified that one of its prior carriers was ordered into rehabilitation, and in early fiscal 2002, into liquidation, creating the possibility that certain prior year claims could be underinsured or uninsured.  Certain claims have been asserted where the coverage would be the responsibility of this prior carrier and/or other carriers that may not have the financial wherewithal to satisfy the claims.  Additionally, some risks and liabilities, including claims for punitive damages, are not covered by insurance.CybersecurityIn the normal course of business, our information technology systems hold sensitive patient information including patient demographic data, eligibility for various medical plans including Medicare and Medicaid and protected health information.  Additionally, we utilize those same systems to perform our day-to-day activities, such as receiving referrals, assigning medical teams to patients, documenting medical information and maintaining an accurate record of all transactions.  We have not experienced any attacks on our information technology systems that have compromised patient data or the Company’s proprietary data.  We maintain our information technology systems with up to date safeguard protection against cyber-attacks including passive intrusion protection, firewalls and virus detection software.  Additionally, on a quarterly basis, we test our information technology systems using the latest cyber-attack software and methods to learn how a successful attack may be made.  We remedy any issues encountered during these tests.  As discussed previously, we are subject to and comply with HIPPA regulations.  However, these safeguards do not ensure that a significant cyber-attack could not occur.  A successful attack on our information technology systems could have significantly negative consequences to the business including liability for compromised patient information and business interruption"
10,CHE,CHEMED CORP,2011-02-28,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
     You should carefully consider the risks described below. They are not the only ones facingthe Company. Other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we deem to beimmaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or resultsof operations.GENERAL     We have incurred debt to finance the operations of the Company.     The Company has debt service obligations that may restrict our operating flexibility. Wecannot assure you that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to service our debt, whichmay require us to borrow additional funds, or restructure or otherwise refinance our debt. Inaddition, the Company has the ability to expand its debt and borrowing capacity subject to variousrestrictions and covenants defined by its creditors. The interest rate the Company pays willfluctuate from time to time based upon a number of factors including current LIBOR rates andCompany operating performance. Significant changes in these factors could result in a materialchange in the Companys interest expense.     Our indebtedness could have important consequences for our business. Among other things, ourindebtedness may:  Limit our ability to obtain additional financing;14Table of Contents  Limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the marketsin which we compete;   Place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with lessindebtedness;   Increase our exposure to interest rate increases due to variable interest rateson certain borrowings;   Limit our ability to complete future acquisitions;   Limit our ability to make capital expenditures;   Render us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions;and   Require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to service andrepay our debt.     Servicing our indebtedness will require a significant amount of cash, and our ability togenerate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.     Our ability to repay or to refinance our indebtedness and to pay interest on our indebtednesswill depend on our operating performance, which may be affected by factors beyond our control.These factors could include operating difficulties, increased operating costs, our competitorsactions and regulatory developments. Our ability to meet our debt service and other obligationsmay depend in significant part on the extent to which we successfully implement our businessstrategy. We cannot assure you that we will be able to implement our strategy fully or that theanticipated results of our strategy will be realized. Current credit market conditions may make itdifficult for us to obtain new financing or refinance our current debt on terms and conditionsacceptable to us.     If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations,we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional equitycapital or restructure our debt. We cannot assure you that our cash flows and capital resourceswill be sufficient to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness in thefuture or that alternative measures would successfully meet our debt service obligations.     As certain of our obligations under our credit facilities and certain other borrowings couldbear interest at floating rates, an increase in interest rates could further increase our debtservice costs and adversely affect our cash flows.     We have debt that is convertible into shares based on the Companys stock price. This couldsignificantly dilute the ownership percentage of current stockholders.The agreements and instruments governing our outstanding debt contain restrictions and limitationsthat could significantly impact our ability to operate our business and adversely affect the priceof our Capital Stock.     The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our instruments of indebtednessrestrict our ability to:  Incur additional debt;   Pay dividends, make redemptions and purchases of Capital Stock and make otherrestricted payments;15Table of Contents  Issue and sell capital stock of subsidiaries;   Sell assets;   Engage in transactions with affiliates;   Restrict distributions from subsidiaries;   Incur liens;   Engage in business other than permitted businesses;   Engage in sale/leaseback transactions;   Engage in mergers or consolidations;   Make capital expenditures;   Make guarantees;   Make investments and acquisitions;   Enter into operating leases;   Hedge interest rates; and   Prepay other debt.     Moreover, if we are unable to meet the terms of the financial covenants or if we breach any ofthese covenants, a default could result under one or more of these agreements. A default, if notwaived by our lenders, could accelerate repayment of our outstanding indebtedness. If accelerationoccurs, we may not be able to repay our debt and it is unlikely that we would be able to borrowsufficient additional funds to refinance such debt on acceptable terms. In the event of anydefault under our credit facilities, the lenders thereunder could elect to declare all outstandingborrowings, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, to be due and payable, and torequire us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings, any of which would be anevent of default.We depend on our management team and the loss of their service could have a material adverse effecton our business, financial condition and results of operations.     Our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of our executive managementteam. The loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financialcondition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, we cannot assure you that we will beable to attract or retain other skilled personnel in the future.Environmental compliance costs and liabilities could increase our expenses and adversely affect ourfinancial condition.     Our operations are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulationsthat prohibit or restrict the discharge of pollutants into the environment and regulate employeeexposure to hazardous substance16Table of Contentsin the workplace. Failure to comply with these laws could subject us to material costs andliabilities, including civil and criminal fines, costs to cleanup contamination we cause and, insome circumstances, costs to cleanup contamination we discover on our own property but did notcause.     Because we use and generate hazardous materials in some of our operations, we are potentiallysubject to material liabilities relating to the cleanup of contamination and personal injuryclaims. In addition, we have retained certain environmental liabilities in connection with thesale of former businesses. We are currently funding the cleanup of historical contamination at oneof our former properties and contributing to the cleanup of third-party sites as a result of oursale of our former subsidiary DuBois Chemicals Inc. Although we have established a reserve forthese liabilities, actual cleanup costs may exceed our current estimates due to factors beyond ourcontrol, such as the discovery of additional contamination or the enforcement of more stringentcleanup requirements. New laws and regulations or their stricter enforcement, the discovery ofpresently unknown conditions or the receipt of additional claims for indemnification could requireus to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities including impairment of ourbrand that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results ofoperations.We are subject to certain anti-takeover statutes that might make it more difficult to effect achange in control of the Company.     We are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware GeneralCorporation Law, which prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with an interestedstockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the personbecame an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribedmanner. The application of Section 203 could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change ofcontrol that could be advantageous to stockholders.An adverse ruling against us in certain litigation could have an adverse effect on our financialcondition and results of operations.     We are involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of our business currently and fromtime to time. The damages claimed against us in some of these cases are substantial.     See the Legal Proceedings sections of this 10-K for discussion of particular matters.     We cannot assure you that we will prevail in pending cases. Regardless of the outcome, suchlitigation is costly to manage, investigate and defend, and the related defense costs, diversion ofmanagements time and related publicity may adversely affect the conduct of our business and theresults of our operations.ROTO-ROOTERWe face intense competition from numerous, fragmented competitors. If we do not competeeffectively, our business may suffer.     We face intense competition from numerous competitors, many of whom have less leverage than wedo. The sewer, drain and pipe cleaning, and plumbing repair businesses are highly fragmented, withthe bulk of the industries consisting of local and regional competitors. We compete primarily onthe basis of advertising, range of services provided, name recognition, availability of emergencyservice, speed and quality of customer service, service guarantees and pricing. Our competitorsmay succeed in developing new or enhanced products and services more successful than ours and inmarketing and selling existing and new products and services better than we do. In addition, newcompetitors may emerge. We cannot make any assurances that we will continue to be able to competesuccessfully with any of these companies.17Table of ContentsOur operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations, exposing us to potential claims andcompliance costs that could adversely affect our business.     We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to franchising,insurance and other aspects of our business. These are discussed in greater detail underGovernment Regulations in the Description of Business section hereof. If we fail to comply withexisting or future laws and regulations, we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines andsanctions. Our franchising activities are subject to various federal and state franchising lawsand regulations, including the rules and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission (the FTC)regarding the offering or sale of franchises. The rules and regulations of the FTC require us toprovide all of our prospective franchisees with specific information regarding us and our franchiseprogram in the form of a detailed franchise offering circular. In addition, a number of statesrequire us to register our franchise offering prior to offering or selling franchises in suchstates. Various state laws also provide for certain rights in favor of franchisees, including (i)limitations on the franchisors ability to terminate a franchise except for good cause, (ii)restrictions on the franchisors ability to deny renewal of a franchise, (iii) circumstances underwhich the franchisor may be required to purchase certain inventory of franchisees when a franchiseis terminated or not renewed in violation of such laws and (iv) provisions relating to arbitration.The ability to engage in the plumbing repair business is also subject to certain limitations andrestrictions imposed by the state and local licensing laws and regulations. We cannot predictwhat legislation or regulations affecting our business will be enacted in the future, how existingor future laws or regulations will be enforced, administered and interpreted, or the amount offuture expenditures that may be required to comply with these laws or regulations. Compliancecosts associated with governmental regulations could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.VITAS Vitas is highly dependent on payments from Medicare and Medicaid. If there are changes in the rateor methods governing these payments, Vitas net patient service revenue and profits couldmaterially decline.     In excess of 90% of Vitas net patient service revenue consists of payments from the Medicareand Medicaid programs. Such payments are made primarily on a per diem basis, subject to annualreimbursement caps. Because Vitas receives a per diem fee to provide eligible services to allpatients, Vitas profitability is largely dependent upon its ability to manage the costs ofproviding hospice services to patients. Increases in operating costs, such as labor and supplycosts that are subject to inflation, without a compensating increase in Medicare and Medicaidrates, could have a material adverse effect on Vitas business in the future. Medicare andMedicaid currently adjust the various hospice payment rates annually based primarily on theincrease or decrease of the hospital wage index basket, regionally adjusted. However, theincreases may be less than actual inflation. Vitas profitability could be negatively impacted ifthis adjustment were eliminated or reduced, or if Vitas costs of providing hospice servicesincreased more than the annual adjustment. In addition, cost pressures resulting from shorterpatient lengths of stay and the use of more expensive forms of palliative care, including drugs anddrug delivery systems, could negatively impact Vitas profitability. Many payors are increasingpressure to control health care costs. In addition, both public and private payors are increasingpressure to decrease, or limit increases in, reimbursement rates for health care services. Vitaslevels of revenue and profitability will be subject to the effect of possible reductions incoverage or payment rates by third-party payors, including payment rates from Medicare andMedicaid.     Each state that maintains a Medicaid program has the option to provide reimbursement forhospice services at reimbursement rates generally required to be at least as much as Medicarerates. All states in which Vitas operates cover Medicaid hospice services; however, we cannotassure you that the states in which Vitas is presently operating or states into which Vitas couldexpand operations will continue to cover Medicaid hospice services. In addition, the Medicare andMedicaid programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive and prospective rateand payment adjustments, administrative rulings, freezes and funding reductions, all of which mayadversely affect the level of program payments and could have a material adverse effect on Vitasbusiness. We cannot assure that Medicare and/or Medicaid payments to hospices will not decrease.Reductions in amounts paid18Table of Contentsby government programs for services or changes in methods or regulations governing payments couldcause Vitas net patient service revenue and profits to materially decline.Approximately 25% of Vitas hospice patients reside in nursing homes. Changes in the laws andregulations regarding payments for hospice services and room and board provided to Vitas hospicepatients residing in nursing homes could reduce its net patient service revenue and profitability.     For Vitas hospice patients receiving nursing home care under certain state Medicaid programswho elect hospice care under Medicare and Medicaid, the state generally must pay Vitas, in additionto the applicable Medicare or Medicaid hospice per diem rate, an amount equal to at least 95% ofthe Medicaid per diem nursing home rate for room and board furnished to the patient by thenursing home. Vitas contracts with various nursing homes for the nursing homes provision ofcertain room and board services that the nursing homes would otherwise provide Medicaid nursinghome patients. Vitas bills and collects from the applicable state Medicaid program an amount equalto approximately 95% of the amount that would otherwise have been paid directly to the nursing homeunder the states Medicaid plan. Under Vitas standard nursing home contracts, it pays the nursinghome for these room and board services at approximately 100% of the Medicaid per diem nursinghome rate.     The reduction or elimination of Medicare and Medicaid payments for hospice patients residingin nursing homes would reduce Vitas net patient service revenue and profitability. In addition,changes in the way nursing homes are reimbursed for room and board services provided to hospicepatients residing in nursing homes could affect Vitas ability to serve patients in nursing homes.If Vitas is unable to maintain relationships with existing patient referral sources or to establishnew referral sources, Vitas growth and profitability could be adversely affected.     Vitas success is heavily dependent on referrals from physicians, long-term care facilities,hospitals and other institutional health care providers, managed care companies, insurancecompanies and other patient referral sources in the communities that its hospice locations serve,as well as on its ability to maintain good relations with these referral sources. Vitas referralsources may refer their patients to other hospice care providers or not to a hospice provider atall. Vitas growth and profitability depend significantly on its ability to establish and maintainclose working relationships with these patient referral sources and to increase awareness andacceptance of hospice care by its referral sources and their patients. We cannot assure you thatVitas will be able to maintain its existing relationships or that it will be able to develop andmaintain new relationships in existing or new markets. Vitas loss of existing relationships orits failure to develop new relationships could adversely affect its ability to expand or maintainits operations and operate profitably. Moreover, we cannot assure you that awareness or acceptanceof hospice care will increase or remain at current levels.Vitas operates in an industry that is subject to extensive government regulation and claimsreviews, and changes in law and regulatory interpretations could reduce its net patient servicerevenue and profitability and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.     The healthcare industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws, rules andregulations relating to, among others:  Payment for services;   Conduct of operations, including fraud and abuse, anti-kickback prohibitions,self-referral prohibitions and false claims;   Privacy and security of medical records;   Employment practices; and19Table of Contents  Various state approval requirements, such as facility and professionallicensure, certificate of need, compliance surveys and other certification orrecertification requirements.     Changes in these laws, rules and regulations or in interpretations thereof could reduce Vitasnet patient service revenue and profitability. Vitas ability to comply with such regulations is akey factor in determining the success of its business. See the Government Regulations section ofthis 10-K for a greater description of these matters.     Fraud and Abuse Laws. Vitas contracts with a significant number of health care providers andpractitioners, including physicians, hospitals and nursing homes and arranges for these entities toprovide services to Vitas patients. Some of these health care providers and practitioners mayrefer, or be in a position to refer, patients to Vitas (or Vitas may refer patients to them).These arrangements may not qualify for a safe harbor. Vitas from time to time seeks guidance fromregulatory counsel as to the changing and evolving interpretations and the potential applicabilityof the Anti-Kickback Law to its programs, and in response thereto, takes such actions as it deemsappropriate. Vitas generally believes that its contracts and arrangements with providers,practitioners and suppliers should not be found to violate the Anti-Kickback Law. However, wecannot assure you that such laws will ultimately be interpreted in a manner consistent with Vitaspractices.     Several health care reform proposals have included an expansion of the Anti-Kickback Law toinclude referrals of any patients regardless of payor source, which is similar to the scope ofcertain laws that have been enacted at the state level. In addition, a number of states in whichVitas operates have laws, which vary from state to state, prohibiting certain direct or indirectremuneration or fee-splitting arrangements between health care providers, regardless of payorsource, for the referral of patients to a particular provider.     The federal Ethics in Patient Referral Act, Section 1877 of the Social Security Act (commonlyknown as the Stark Law) prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients fordesignated health services to entities in which they hold an ownership or investment interest orwith whom they have a compensation arrangement, subject to certain statutory or regulatoryexceptions. We cannot assure you that future statutory or regulatory changes will not result inhospice services being subject to the Stark Laws ownership, investment, compensation or referralprohibitions. Several states in which Vitas operates have similar laws which likewise are subjectto change. Any such changes could adversely affect the business, financial condition and operatingresults of Vitas.     Further, under separate statutes, submission of claims for items or services that are notprovided as claimed may lead to civil money penalties, criminal fines and imprisonment and/orexclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federally funded state health careprograms. These false claims statutes include the federal False Claims Act, which allows anyperson to bring suit on behalf of the federal government, known as a qui tam action, alleging falseor fraudulent Medicare or Medicaid claims or other violations of the statute and to share in anyamounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. See the discussion of thegovernmental investigations pending against Vitas under Other Healthcare Regulations, above.     Certificate of Need Laws. Many states, including Florida, have certificate of need laws orother similar health planning laws that apply to hospice care providers. These states may requiresome form of state agency review or approval prior to opening a new hospice program, to adding orexpanding hospice services, to undertaking significant capital expenditures or under otherspecified circumstances. Approval under these certificate of need laws is generally conditioned onthe showing of a demonstrable need for services in the community. Vitas may seek to develop,acquire or expand hospice programs in states having certificate of need laws. To the extent thatstate agencies require Vitas to obtain a certificate of need or other similar approvals to expandservices at existing hospice programs or to make acquisitions or develop hospice programs in new orexisting geographical markets, Vitas plans could be adversely affected by a failure to obtain acertificate or approval. In addition, competitors may seek20Table of Contentsadministratively or judicially to challenge such an approval or proposed approval by the stateagency. Such a challenge, whether or not ultimately successful, could adversely affect Vitas.     Other Federal and State Regulations. The federal government and all states regulate variousaspects of the hospice industry and Vitas business. In particular, Vitas operations are subjectto federal and state health regulatory laws, including those covering professional services, thedispensing of drugs and certain types of hospice activities. Certain of Vitas employees aresubject to state laws and regulations governing professional practice. Vitas operations aresubject to periodic survey by governmental authorities and private accrediting entities to assurecompliance with applicable state licensing, and Medicare and Medicaid certification andaccreditation standards, as the case may be. From time to time in the ordinary course of business,Vitas receives survey reports noting deficiencies for alleged failure to comply with applicablerequirements. Vitas reviews such reports and takes appropriate corrective action. The failure toeffect such action could result in one of Vitas hospice programs being terminated from theMedicare hospice program. Any termination of one or more of Vitas hospice locations from theMedicare hospice program could adversely affect Vitas net patient service revenue andprofitability and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. The failureto obtain, renew or maintain any of the required regulatory approvals, certifications or licensescould materially adversely affect Vitas business and could prevent the programs involved fromoffering products and services to patients. In addition, laws and regulations often are adopted toregulate new products, services and industries. We cannot assure you that either the states or thefederal government will not impose additional regulations on Vitas activities, which mightmaterially adversely affect Vitas, including impairing the value of its brand.     Claims Review. The Medicare and Medicaid programs and their fiscal intermediaries and otherpayors periodically conduct pre-payment or post-payment reviews and other reviews and audits ofhealth care claims, including hospice claims. As a result of such reviews or audits, Vitas couldbe required to return any amounts found to be overpaid, or amounts found to be overpaid could berecouped through reductions in future payments. There is pressure from state and federalgovernments and other payors to scrutinize health care claims to determine their validity andappropriateness. During the past several years, Vitas claims have been subject to review andaudit. We cannot assure you that reviews and/or similar audits of Vitas claims will not result inmaterial recoupments, denials or other actions that could have a material adverse effect on Vitasbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. See the discussion of OIG investigationspending against Vitas under Other Health Care Regulations, above.     Regulation and Provision of Continuous Home Care. Vitas provides continuous home care topatients requiring such care. Continuous home care is provided to patients while at home, duringperiods of crisis when intensive monitoring and care, primarily nursing care, is required in orderto achieve palliation or management of acute medical symptoms. Continuous home care requires aminimum of 8 hours of care within a 24-hour day, which begins and ends at midnight. The care mustbe predominantly nursing care provided by either a registered nurse or licensed practical nurse.     Continuous home care can be challenging for a hospice to provide for a number of reasons,including the need to have available sufficient skilled and trained staff to furnish such care, theneed to manage the staffing and provision of such care, and a shortage of nurses that can make itparticularly difficult to attract and retain nurses that are required to furnish a majority of suchcare. Medicare reimbursement for continuous home care has been calculated by multiplying theapplicable continuous home care hourly rate by the number of hours of care provided. If the carewas provided for less than one hour, Medicare requires reporting in 15-minute increments of careprovided, with no rounding.     Medicare reimbursement for continuous home care is subject to a number of requirements posingfurther challenges for a hospice providing such care. For example, if a patient requires skilledinterventions for palliation or symptom management that can be accomplished in less than 8aggregate hours within the 24-hour period, if the majority of care can be accomplished by someoneother than a registered nurse or a licensed practical nurse (e.g., if a majority of care isfurnished by a home health aide or homemaker), or if for any reason less than 8 hours of direct21Table of Contentscare are provided (such as when a patient dies before 8 AM even if 7 or more hours of care has beenprovided), the care rendered cannot be reimbursed by Medicare at the continuous home care rate(although the care instead may be eligible for Medicare reimbursement at the reduced routine homecare day rate). As a result of such requirements, Vitas may incur the costs of providing servicesintended to be continuous home care services yet be unable to bill or be reimbursed for suchservices at the continuous home care rate. We cannot assure you that challenges in providingcontinuous home care will not cause Vitas net patient service revenue and profits to materiallydecline or that reviews and/or similar audits of Vitas claims will not result in materialrecoupments, denials or other actions that could have a material adverse effect on Vitas business,financial condition and results of operations.     Compliance. Vitas maintains an internal regulatory compliance review program and from time totime retains regulatory counsel for guidance on compliance matters. We cannot assure you, however,that Vitas practices, if reviewed, would be found to be in compliance with applicable healthregulatory laws, as such laws ultimately may be interpreted, or that any non-compliance with suchlaws would not have a material adverse effect on Vitas.Federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives could require Vitas to expend substantialsums on acquiring, implementing and supporting new information systems, which could negativelyimpact its profitability.     There are currently numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives at both the state andfederal levels that address patient privacy concerns. We cannot predict the total financial orother impact of the regulations on Vitas operations. In addition, although Vitas managementbelieves it is in compliance with the requirement of patient privacy regulations, we cannot assureyou that Vitas will not be found to have violated state and federal laws, rules or guidelinessurrounding patient privacy. Compliance with current and future HIPAA requirements or any otherfederal or state privacy initiatives could require Vitas to make substantial investments, whichcould negatively impact its profitability and cash flows.Vitas growth strategies may not be successful, which could adversely affect its business.     A significant element of Vitas growth strategy is expected to include expansion of itsbusiness in new and existing markets. This aspect of Vitas growth strategy may not be successful,which could adversely impact its growth and profitability. We cannot assure you that Vitas will beable to:  Identify markets that meet its selection criteria for new hospice locations;   Hire and retain qualified management teams to operate each of its new hospicelocations;   Manage a large and geographically diverse group of hospice locations;   Become Medicare and Medicaid certified in new markets;   Generate sufficient hospice admissions in new markets to operate profitably inthese new markets;   Compete effectively with existing hospices in new markets; or   Obtain state licensure and/or a certificate of need from appropriate stateagencies in new markets.     In addition to growing existing locations and developing new hospice locations, Vitas growthis expected to include expansion through acquisition of other hospices. We cannot assure you thatVitas acquisition strategy will be successful. The success of Vitas acquisition strategy dependsupon a number of factors, including:22Table of Contents  Its ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates;   Its ability to negotiate favorable acquisition terms, including purchase price,which may be adversely affected due to increased competition with other buyers;   The availability of financing on favorable terms, or at all;   Its ability to integrate effectively the systems and operations of acquiredhospices;   Its ability to retain key personnel of acquired hospices; and   Its ability to obtain required regulatory approvals.     Acquisitions involve a number of other risks, including diversion of managements attentionfrom other business concerns and assuming known or unknown liabilities of acquired hospices,including liabilities for failure to comply with health care laws and regulations. Integratingacquired hospices may place significant strains on Vitas current operating and financial systemsand controls. Vitas may not successfully overcome these risks or any other problems encountered inconnection with its acquisition strategy.     In addition, since 1990, Vitas has acquired hospice programs, some of which involvedacquisitions of hospice programs from not-for-profit entities. Vitas believes that acquisitions ofnot-for-profit programs are generally more complex than acquisitions from for-profit entities andthat a substantial number of acquisition opportunities are likely to involve acquisitions fromnot-for-profit entities. Such acquisitions are subject to provisions of the Internal Revenue Codeand, in certain states, state attorney general powers, which have been interpreted to require thatthe consideration paid for the assets purchased be at fair market value and, where applicable, thatany fees paid for services be reasonable. In many states there is no mechanism for state attorneygeneral pre-clearance of transactions to assure that applicable standards have been met. Entitiesthat acquired not-for-profit hospices could face potential liability if the acquisition transactionis not structured to comply with Internal Revenue Code and state law requirements, and in somecases the transaction could be enjoined or subject to rescission. The acquisition ofnot-for-profit businesses, including the fairness of the purchase price paid, has receivedincreasing regulatory scrutiny by state attorneys general and other regulatory authorities.Although Vitas believes that reasonable actions have been taken to date to establish the fairmarket value of assets purchased in prior acquisitions of hospice operations from not-for-profitentities and the reasonableness of fees paid for services, we cannot assure you that suchtransactions or any future similar transactions will not be challenged or that, if challenged, theresults of such challenge would not have a material adverse effect on Vitas business.Vitas loss of key management personnel or its inability to hire and retain skilled employees couldadversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.     Vitas future success significantly depends upon the continued service of its seniormanagement personnel. The loss of one or more of Vitas key senior management personnel or itsinability to hire and retain new skilled employees could negatively impact Vitas ability tomaintain or increase patient referrals, a key aspect of its growth strategy, and could adverselyaffect its future operating results.     Competition for skilled employees is intense, and the process of locating and recruitingskilled employees with the combination of qualifications and attributes required to careeffectively for terminally ill patients and their families can be difficult and lengthy. We cannotassure you that Vitas will be successful in attracting, retaining or training highly skillednursing, management, community education, operations, admissions and other personnel. Vitasbusiness could be disrupted and its growth and profitability negatively impacted if it is unable toattract and retain skilled employees.23Table of ContentsA nationwide shortage of qualified nurses could adversely affect Vitas profitability, growthand ability to continue to provide quality, responsive hospice services to its patients as nursingwages and benefits increase.     The substantial majority of Vitas workforce is nurses. Vitas depends on qualified nurses toprovide quality, responsive hospice services to its patients. The current nationwide shortage ofqualified nurses impacts some of the markets in which Vitas provides hospice services. In responseto this shortage, Vitas has adjusted its wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and toengage contract nurses. Vitas inability to attract and retain qualified nurses could adverselyaffect its ability to provide quality, responsive hospice services to its patients and its abilityto increase or maintain patient census in those markets. Increases in the wages and benefitsrequired to attract and retain qualified nurses or an increase in reliance on contract nurses couldnegatively impact profitability.Vitas may not be able to compete successfully against other hospice providers, and competitivepressures may limit its ability to maintain or increase its market position and adversely affectits profitability, financial condition and results of operations.     Hospice care in the United States is highly competitive. In many areas in which Vitashospices are located, they compete with a large number of organizations, including:  Community-based hospice providers;   National and regional companies;   Hospital-based hospice and palliative care programs;   Physician groups;   Nursing homes;   Home health agencies;   Infusion therapy companies; and   Nursing agencies.     Various health care companies have diversified into the hospice market. Other companies,including hospitals and health care organizations that are not currently providing hospice care,may enter the markets Vitas serves and expand the variety of services offered to include hospicecare. We cannot assure you that Vitas will not encounter increased competition in the future thatcould limit its ability to maintain or increase its market position, including competition fromparties in a position to impact referrals to Vitas. Such increased competition could have amaterial adverse effect on Vitas business, financial condition and results of operations.Changes in rates or methods of payment for Vitas services could adversely affect its revenues andprofits.     Managed care organizations have grown substantially in terms of the percentage of thepopulation they cover and their control over an increasing portion of the health care economy.Managed care organizations have continued to consolidate to enhance their ability to influence thedelivery of health care services and to exert pressure to control health care costs. Vitas has anumber of contractual arrangements with managed care organizations and other similar parties.     Vitas provides hospice care to many Medicare beneficiaries who receive their non-hospicehealth care services from health maintenance organizations (HMOs) under Medicare risk contracts.Under such contracts24Table of Contentsbetween HMOs and the federal Department of Health and Human Services, the Medicare payments forhospice services are excluded from the per-member, per-month payment from Medicare to HMOs andinstead are paid directly by Medicare to the hospices. As a result, Vitas payments for Medicarebeneficiaries enrolled in Medicare risk HMOs are processed in the same way with the same rates asother Medicare beneficiaries. We cannot assure, however, that payment for hospice services willcontinue to be excluded from HMO payment under Medicare risk contracts and similar Medicare managedcare plans or that if not excluded, managed care organization or other large third-party payorswould not use their power to influence and exert pressure on health care providers to reduce costsin a manner that could have a material adverse effect on Vitas business, financial condition andresults of operations.Liability claims may have an adverse effect on Vitas, and its insurance coverage may be inadequate.     Participants in the hospice industry are subject to lawsuits alleging negligence, productliability or other similar legal theories, many of which involve large claims and significantdefense costs. From time to time, Vitas is subject to such and other types of lawsuits. See thedescription below under Legal Proceedings. The ultimate liability for claims, if any, could have amaterial adverse effect on its financial condition or operating results. Although Vitas currentlymaintains liability insurance intended to cover the claims, we cannot assure you that the coveragelimits of such insurance policies will be adequate or that all such claims will be covered by theinsurance. In addition, Vitas insurance policies must be renewed annually and may be subject tocancellation during the policy period. While Vitas has been able to obtain liability insurance inthe past, such insurance varies in cost, is difficult to obtain and may not be available in thefuture on terms acceptable to Vitas, if at all.     A successful claim in excess of the insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect onVitas. Claims, regardless of their merit or eventual outcome, also may have a material adverseeffect on Vitas business and reputation due to the costs of litigation, diversion of managementstime and related publicity.     Vitas procures professional liability coverage on a claims-made basis. The insurancecontracts specify that coverage is available only during the term of each insurance contract.Vitas management intends to renew or replace the existing claims-made policy annually but suchcoverage is difficult to obtain, may be subject to cancellation and may be written by carriers thatare unable, or unwilling to pay claims. During fiscal 2001, Vitas was notified that one of itsprior carriers was ordered into rehabilitation, and in early fiscal 2002, into liquidation,creating the possibility that certain prior year claims could be underinsured or uninsured.Certain claims have been asserted where the coverage would be the responsibility of this priorcarrier and/or other carriers that may not have the financial wherewithal to satisfy the claims.Additionally, some risks and liabilities, including claims for punitive damages, are not covered byinsurance"
11,CHE,CHEMED CORP,2010-02-26,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
     You should carefully consider the risks described below. They are not the only ones facingthe Company. Other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we deem to beimmaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or resultsof operations.GENERAL     We have incurred debt to finance the operations of the Company. We reduced our outstandingdebt by $16.3 million in 2009.     The Company has debt service obligations that may restrict our operating flexibility. Wecannot assure you that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to service our debt, whichmay require us to borrow additional funds, or restructure or otherwise refinance our debt. Inaddition, the Company has the ability to expand its debt and borrowing capacity subject to variousrestrictions and covenants defined by its creditors. The interest rate the Company pays willfluctuate from time to time based upon a number of factors including current LIBOR rates andCompany operating performance. Significant changes in these factors could result in a materialchange in the Companys interest expense.     Our indebtedness could have important consequences for our business. Among other things, ourindebtedness may:  Limit our ability to obtain additional financing;   Limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the marketsin which we compete;   Place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with lessindebtedness;   Increase our exposure to interest rate increases due to variable interest rateson certain borrowings;   Limit our ability to complete future acquisitions;   Limit our ability to make capital expenditures;   Render us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions;and   Require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to service andrepay our debt.     Servicing our indebtedness will require a significant amount of cash, and our ability togenerate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.     Our ability to repay or to refinance our indebtedness and to pay interest on our indebtednesswill depend on our operating performance, which may be affected by factors beyond our control.These factors could include operating difficulties, increased operating costs, our competitorsactions and regulatory developments. Our ability to meet our debt service and other obligationsmay depend in significant part on the extent to which we successfully15Table of Contentsimplement our business strategy. We cannot assure you that we will be able to implement ourstrategy fully or that the anticipated results of our strategy will be realized. Current creditmarket conditions may make it difficult for us to obtain new financing or refinance our currentdebt on terms and conditions acceptable to us.     If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations,we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional equitycapital or restructure our debt. We cannot assure you that our cash flows and capital resourceswill be sufficient to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness in thefuture or that alternative measures would successfully meet our debt service obligations.     As certain of our obligations under our credit facilities and certain other borrowings couldbear interest at floating rates, an increase in interest rates could further increase our debtservice costs and adversely affect our cash flows.     We have debt that is convertible into shares based on the Companys stock price. This couldsignificantly dilute the ownership percentage of current stockholders.The agreements and instruments governing our outstanding debt contain restrictions and limitationsthat could significantly impact our ability to operate our business and adversely affect the priceof our Capital Stock.     The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our instruments of indebtednessrestrict our ability to:  Incur additional debt;   Pay dividends, make redemptions and purchases of Capital Stock and make otherrestrictedpayments;   Issue and sell capital stock of subsidiaries;   Sell assets;   Engage in transactions with affiliates;   Restrict distributions from subsidiaries;   Incur liens;   Engage in business other than permitted businesses;   Engage in sale/leaseback transactions;   Engage in mergers or consolidations;   Make capital expenditures;   Make guarantees;   Make investments and acquisitions;16Table of Contents  Enter into operating leases;   Hedge interest rates; and   Prepay other debt.     Moreover, if we are unable to meet the terms of the financial covenants or if we breach any ofthese covenants, a default could result under one or more of these agreements. A default, if notwaived by our lenders, could accelerate repayment of our outstanding indebtedness. If accelerationoccurs, we may not be able to repay our debt and it is unlikely that we would be able to borrowsufficient additional funds to refinance such debt on acceptable terms. In the event of anydefault under our credit facilities, the lenders thereunder could elect to declare all outstandingborrowings, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, to be due and payable, and torequire us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings, any of which would be anevent of default.We depend on our management team and the loss of their service could have a material adverse effecton our business, financial condition and results of operations.     Our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of our executive managementteam. The loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financialcondition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, we cannot assure you that we will beable to attract or retain other skilled personnel in the future.Environmental compliance costs and liabilities could increase our expenses and adversely affect ourfinancial condition.     Our operations are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulationsthat prohibit or restrict the discharge of pollutants into the environment and regulate employeeexposure to hazardous substance in the workplace. Failure to comply with these laws could subjectus to material costs and liabilities, including civil and criminal fines, costs to cleanupcontamination we cause and, in some circumstances, costs to cleanup contamination we discover onour own property but did not cause.     Because we use and generate hazardous materials in some of our operations, we are potentiallysubject to material liabilities relating to the cleanup of contamination and personal injuryclaims. In addition, we have retained certain environmental liabilities in connection with thesale of former businesses. We are currently funding the cleanup of historical contamination at oneof our former properties and contributing to the cleanup of third-party sites as a result of oursale of our former subsidiary DuBois Chemicals Inc. Although we have established a reserve forthese liabilities, actual cleanup costs may exceed our current estimates due to factors beyond ourcontrol, such as the discovery of additional contamination or the enforcement of more stringentcleanup requirements. New laws and regulations or their stricter enforcement, the discovery ofpresently unknown conditions or the receipt of additional claims for indemnification could requireus to incur costs or become the basis for new or increasedliabilities including impairment of our brand that could have a materialadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to certain anti-takeover statutes that might make it more difficult to effect achange in control of the Company.     We are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware GeneralCorporation Law, which prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with an interestedstockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the personbecame an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribedmanner. The application of Section 203 could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change ofcontrol that could be advantageous to stockholders.17Table of ContentsAn adverse ruling against us in certain litigation could have an adverse effect on our financialcondition and results of operations.     We are involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of our business currently and fromtime to time. The damages claimed against us in some of these cases are substantial.     See the Legal Proceedings sections of this 10-K for discussion of particular matters.     We cannot assure you that we will prevail in pending cases. Regardless of the outcome, suchlitigation is costly to manage, investigate and defend, and the related defense costs, diversion ofmanagements time and related publicity may adversely affect the conduct of our business and theresults of our operations.ROTO-ROOTERWe face intense competition from numerous, fragmented competitors. If we do not competeeffectively, our business may suffer.     We face intense competition from numerous competitors, many of whom have less leverage than wedo. The sewer, drain and pipe cleaning, and plumbing repair businesses are highly fragmented, withthe bulk of the industries consisting of local and regional competitors. We compete primarily onthe basis of advertising, range of services provided, name recognition, availability of emergencyservice, speed and quality of customer service, service guarantees and pricing. Our competitorsmay succeed in developing new or enhanced products and services more successful than ours and inmarketing and selling existing and new products and services better than we do. In addition, newcompetitors may emerge. We cannot make any assurances that we will continue to be able to competesuccessfully with any of these companies.Our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations, exposing us to potential claims andcompliance costs that could adversely affect our business.     We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to franchising,insurance and other aspects of our business. These are discussed in greater detail underGovernment Regulations in the Description of Business section hereof. If we fail to comply withexisting or future laws and regulations, we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines andsanctions. Our franchising activities are subject to various federal and state franchising lawsand regulations, including the rules and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission (the FTC)regarding the offering or sale of franchises. The rules and regulations of the FTC require us toprovide all of our prospective franchisees with specific information regarding us and our franchiseprogram in the form of a detailed franchise offering circular. In addition, a number of statesrequire us to register our franchise offering prior to offering or selling franchises in suchstates. Various state laws also provide for certain rights in favor of franchisees, including (i)limitations on the franchisors ability to terminate a franchise except for good cause, (ii)restrictions on the franchisors ability to deny renewal of a franchise, (iii) circumstances underwhich the franchisor may be required to purchase certain inventory of franchisees when a franchiseis terminated or not renewed in violation of such laws and (iv) provisions relating to arbitration.The ability to engage in the plumbing repair business is also subject to certain limitations andrestrictions imposed by the state and local licensing laws and regulations. We cannot predictwhat legislation or regulations affecting our business will be enacted in the future, how existingor future laws or regulations will be enforced, administered and interpreted, or the amount offuture expenditures that may be required to comply with these laws or regulations. Compliancecosts associated with governmental regulations could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.18Table of ContentsVITAS Vitas is highly dependent on payments from Medicare and Medicaid. If there are changes in the rateor methods governing these payments, Vitas net patient service revenue and profits couldmaterially decline.     In excess of 90% of Vitas net patient service revenue consists of payments from the Medicareand Medicaid programs. Such payments are made primarily on a per diem basis, subject to annualreimbursement caps. Because Vitas receives a per diem fee to provide eligible services to allpatients, Vitas profitability is largely dependent upon its ability to manage the costs ofproviding hospice services to patients. Increases in operating costs, such as labor and supplycosts that are subject to inflation, without a compensating increase in Medicare and Medicaidrates, could have a material adverse effect on Vitas business in the future. Medicare andMedicaid currently adjust the various hospice payment rates annually based primarily on the increase ordecrease of the hospital wage index basket, regionally adjusted. However, the increases may beless than actual inflation. Vitas profitability could be negatively impacted if this adjustmentwere eliminated or reduced, or if Vitas costs of providing hospice services increased more thanthe annual adjustment. In addition, cost pressures resulting from shorter patient lengths of stayand the use of more expensive forms of palliative care, including drugs and drug delivery systems,could negatively impact Vitas profitability. Many payors are increasing pressure to controlhealth care costs. In addition, both public and private payors are increasing pressure todecrease, or limit increases in, reimbursement rates for health care services. Vitas levels ofrevenue and profitability will be subject to the effect of possible reductions in coverage orpayment rates by third-party payors, including payment rates from Medicare and Medicaid.     Each state that maintains a Medicaid program has the option to provide reimbursement forhospice services at reimbursement rates generally required to be at least as much as Medicarerates. All states in which Vitas operates cover Medicaid hospice services; however, we cannotassure you that the states in which Vitas is presently operating or states into which Vitas couldexpand operations will continue to cover Medicaid hospice services. In addition, the Medicare andMedicaid programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive and prospective rateand payment adjustments, administrative rulings, freezes and funding reductions, all of which mayadversely affect the level of program payments and could have a material adverse effect on Vitasbusiness. We cannot assure that Medicare and/or Medicaid payments to hospices will not decrease.Reductions in amounts paid by government programs for services or changes in methods or regulationsgoverning payments could cause Vitas net patient service revenue and profits to materiallydecline.Approximately 25% of Vitas hospice patients reside in nursing homes. Changes in the laws andregulations regarding payments for hospice services and room and board provided to Vitas hospicepatients residing in nursing homes could reduce its net patient service revenue and profitability.     For Vitas hospice patients receiving nursing home care under certain state Medicaid programswho elect hospice care under Medicare and Medicaid, the state generally must pay Vitas, in additionto the applicable Medicare or Medicaid hospice per diem rate, an amount equal to at least 95% ofthe Medicaid per diem nursing home rate for room and board furnished to the patient by thenursing home. Vitas contracts with various nursing homes for the nursing homes provision ofcertain room and board services that the nursing homes would otherwise provide Medicaid nursinghome patients. Vitas bills and collects from the applicable state Medicaid program an amount equalto approximately 95% of the amount that would otherwise have been paid directly to the nursing homeunder the states Medicaid plan. Under Vitas standard nursing home contracts, it pays the nursinghome for these room and board services at approximately 100% of the Medicaid per diem nursinghome rate.     The reduction or elimination of Medicare and Medicaid payments for hospice patients residingin nursing homes would reduce Vitas net patient service revenue and profitability. In addition,changes in the way nursing homes are reimbursed for room and board services provided to hospicepatients residing in nursing homes could affect Vitas ability to serve patients in nursing homes.19Table of ContentsIf Vitas is unable to maintain relationships with existing patient referral sources or to establishnew referral sources, Vitas growth and profitability could be adversely affected.     Vitas success is heavily dependent on referrals from physicians, long-term care facilities,hospitals and other institutional health care providers, managed care companies, insurancecompanies and other patient referral sources in the communities that its hospice locations serve,as well as on its ability to maintain good relations with these referral sources. Vitas referralsources may refer their patients to other hospice care providers or not to a hospice provider atall. Vitas growth and profitability depend significantly on its ability to establish and maintainclose working relationships with these patient referral sources and to increase awareness andacceptance of hospice care by its referral sources and their patients. We cannot assure you thatVitas will be able to maintain its existing relationships or that it will be able to develop andmaintain new relationships in existing or new markets. Vitas loss of existing relationships orits failure to develop new relationships could adversely affect its ability to expand or maintainits operations and operate profitably. Moreover, we cannot assure you that awareness or acceptanceof hospice care will increase or remain at current levels.Vitas operates in an industry that is subject to extensive government regulation and claimsreviews, and changes in law and regulatory interpretations could reduce its net patient servicerevenue and profitability and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.     The healthcare industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws, rules andregulations relating to, among others:  Payment for services;   Conduct of operations, including fraud and abuse, anti-kickback prohibitions,self-referralprohibitions and false claims;   Privacy and security of medical records;   Employment practices; and   Various state approval requirements, such as facility and professionallicensure, certificate of need, compliance surveys and other certification orrecertification requirements.     Changes in these laws, rules and regulations or in interpretations thereof could reduce Vitasnet patient service revenue and profitability. Vitas ability to comply with such regulations is akey factor in determining the success of its business. See the Government Regulations section ofthis 10-K for a greater description of these matters.     Fraud and Abuse Laws. Vitas contracts with a significant number of health care providers andpractitioners, including physicians, hospitals and nursing homes and arranges for these entities toprovide services to Vitas patients. Some of these health care providers and practitioners mayrefer, or be in a position to refer, patients to Vitas (or Vitas may refer patients to them).These arrangements may not qualify for a safe harbor. Vitas from time to time seeks guidance fromregulatory counsel as to the changing and evolving interpretations and the potential applicabilityof the Anti-Kickback Law to its programs, and in response thereto, takes such actions as it deemsappropriate. Vitas generally believes that its contracts and arrangements with providers,practitioners and suppliers should not be found to violate the Anti-Kickback Law. However, wecannot assure you that such laws will ultimately be interpreted in a manner consistent with Vitaspractices.     Several health care reform proposals have included an expansion of the Anti-Kickback Law toinclude referrals of any patients regardless of payor source, which is similar to the scope ofcertain laws that have been enacted at the state level. In addition, a number of states in whichVitas operates have laws, which vary from state20Table of Contentsto state, prohibiting certain direct or indirect remuneration or fee-splitting arrangements betweenhealth care providers, regardless of payor source, for the referral of patients to a particularprovider.     The federal Ethics in Patient Referral Act, Section 1877 of the Social Security Act (commonlyknown as the Stark Law) prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients fordesignated health services to entities in which they hold an ownership or investment interest orwith whom they have a compensation arrangement, subject to certain statutory or regulatoryexceptions. We cannot assure you that future statutory or regulatory changes will not result inhospice services being subject to the Stark Laws ownership, investment, compensation or referralprohibitions. Several states in which Vitas operates have similar laws which likewise are subjectto change. Any such changes could adversely affect the business, financial condition and operatingresults of Vitas.     Further, under separate statutes, submission of claims for items or services that are notprovided as claimed may lead to civil money penalties, criminal fines and imprisonment and/orexclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federally funded state health careprograms. These false claims statutes include the federal False Claims Act, which allows anyperson to bring suit on behalf of the federal government, known as a qui tam action, alleging falseor fraudulent Medicare or Medicaid claims or other violations of the statute and to share in anyamounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. See the discussion of thegovernmental investigations pending against Vitas under Other Healthcare Regulations, above.     Certificate of Need Laws. Many states, including Florida, have certificate of need laws orother similar health planning laws that apply to hospice care providers. These states may requiresome form of state agency review or approval prior to opening a new hospice program, to adding orexpanding hospice services, to undertaking significant capital expenditures or under otherspecified circumstances. Approval under these certificate of need laws is generally conditioned onthe showing of a demonstrable need for services in the community. Vitas may seek to develop,acquire or expand hospice programs in states having certificate of need laws. To the extent thatstate agencies require Vitas to obtain a certificate of need or other similar approvals to expandservices at existing hospice programs or to make acquisitions or develop hospice programs in new orexisting geographical markets, Vitas plans could be adversely affected by a failure to obtain acertificate or approval. In addition, competitors may seek administratively or judicially tochallenge such an approval or proposed approval by the state agency. Such a challenge, whether ornot ultimately successful, could adversely affect Vitas.     Other Federal and State Regulations. The federal government and all states regulate variousaspects of the hospice industry and Vitas business. In particular, Vitas operations are subjectto federal and state health regulatory laws, including those covering professional services, thedispensing of drugs and certain types of hospice activities. Certain of Vitas employees aresubject to state laws and regulations governing professional practice. Vitas operations aresubject to periodic survey by governmental authorities and private accrediting entities to assurecompliance with applicable state licensing, and Medicare and Medicaid certification andaccreditation standards, as the case may be. From time to time in the ordinary course of business,Vitas receives survey reports noting deficiencies for alleged failure to comply with applicablerequirements. Vitas reviews such reports and takes appropriate corrective action. The failure toeffect such action could result in one of Vitas hospice programs being terminated from theMedicare hospice program. Any termination of one or more of Vitas hospice locations from theMedicare hospice program could adversely affect Vitas net patient service revenue andprofitability and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. The failureto obtain, renew or maintain any of the required regulatory approvals, certifications or licensescould materially adversely affect Vitas business and could prevent the programs involved fromoffering products and services to patients. In addition, laws and regulations often are adopted toregulate new products, services and industries. We cannot assure you that either the states or thefederal government will not impose additional regulations on Vitas activities, which mightmaterially adversely affect Vitas, including impairing the value ofits brand.     Claims Review. The Medicare and Medicaid programs and their fiscal intermediaries and otherpayors periodically conduct pre-payment or post-payment reviews and other reviews and audits ofhealth care claims,21Table of Contentsincluding hospice claims. As a result of such reviews or audits, Vitas could be required to returnany amounts found to be overpaid, or amounts found to be overpaid could be recouped throughreductions in future payments. There is pressure from state and federal governments and otherpayors to scrutinize health care claims to determine their validity and appropriateness. Duringthe past several years, Vitas claims have been subject to review and audit. We cannot assure youthat reviews and/or similar audits of Vitas claims will not result in material recoupments,denials or other actions that could have a material adverse effect on Vitas business, financialcondition and results of operations. See the discussion of OIG investigations pending againstVitas under Other Health Care Regulations, above.     Regulation and Provision of Continuous Home Care. Vitas provides continuous home care topatients requiring such care. Continuous home care is provided to patients while at home, duringperiods of crisis when intensive monitoring and care, primarily nursing care, is required in orderto achieve palliation or management of acute medical symptoms. Continuous home care requires aminimum of 8 hours of care within a 24-hour day, which begins and ends at midnight. The care mustbe predominantly nursing care provided by either a registered nurse or licensed practical nurse.     Continuous home care can be challenging for a hospice to provide for a number of reasons,including the need to have available sufficient skilled and trained staff to furnish such care, theneed to manage the staffing and provision of such care, and a shortage of nurses that can make itparticularly difficult to attract and retain nurses that are required to furnish a majority of suchcare. Medicare reimbursement for continuous home care has been calculated by multiplying theapplicable continuous home care hourly rate by the number of hours of care provided. If the carewas provided for less than one hour, Medicare requires reporting in 15-minute increments of careprovided, with no rounding.     Medicare reimbursement for continuous home care is subject to a number of requirements posingfurther challenges for a hospice providing such care. For example, if a patient requires skilledinterventions for palliation or symptom management that can be accomplished in less than 8aggregate hours within the 24-hour period, if the majority of care can be accomplished by someoneother than a registered nurse or a licensed practical nurse (e.g., if a majority of care isfurnished by a home health aide or homemaker), or if for any reason less than 8 hours of directcare are provided (such as when a patient dies before 8 AM even if 7 or more hours of care has beenprovided), the care rendered cannot be reimbursed by Medicare at the continuous home care rate(although the care instead may be eligible for Medicare reimbursement at the reduced routine homecare day rate). As a result of such requirements, Vitas may incur the costs of providing servicesintended to be continuous home care services yet be unable to bill or be reimbursed for suchservices at the continuous home care rate. We cannot assure you that challenges in providingcontinuous home care will not cause Vitas net patient service revenue and profits to materiallydecline or that reviews and/or similar audits of Vitas claims will not result in materialrecoupments, denials or other actions that could have a material adverse effect on Vitas business,financial condition and results of operations.     Compliance. Vitas maintains an internal regulatory compliance review program and from time totime retains regulatory counsel for guidance on compliance matters. We cannot assure you, however,that Vitas practices, if reviewed, would be found to be in compliance with applicable healthregulatory laws, as such laws ultimately may be interpreted, or that any non-compliance with suchlaws would not have a material adverse effect on Vitas.Federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to patient privacy could requireVitas to expend substantial sums on acquiring, implementing and supporting new information systems,which could negatively impact its profitability.     There are currently numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives at both the state andfederal levels that address patient privacy concerns. We cannot predict the total financial orother impact of the regulations on Vitas operations. In addition, although Vitas managementbelieves it is in compliance with the requirement of patient privacy regulations, we cannot assureyou that Vitas will not be found to have violated state and federal laws, rules22Table of Contentsor guidelines surrounding patient privacy. Compliance with current and future HIPAA requirementsor any other federal or state privacy initiatives could require Vitas to make substantialinvestments, which could negatively impact its profitability and cash flows.Vitas growth strategies may not be successful, which could adversely affect its business.     A significant element of Vitas growth strategy is expected to include expansion of itsbusiness in new and existing markets. This aspect of Vitas growth strategy may not be successful,which could adversely impact its growth and profitability. We cannot assure you that Vitas will beable to:  Identify markets that meet its selection criteria for new hospice locations;   Hire and retain qualified management teams to operate each of its new hospicelocations;   Manage a large and geographically diverse group of hospice locations;   Become Medicare and Medicaid certified in new markets;   Generate sufficient hospice admissions in new markets to operate profitably inthese new markets;   Compete effectively with existing hospices in new markets; or   Obtain state licensure and/or a certificate of need from appropriate stateagencies in new markets.     In addition to growing existing locations and developing new hospice locations, Vitas growthis expected to include expansion through acquisition of other hospices. We cannot assure you thatVitas acquisition strategy will be successful. The success of Vitas acquisition strategy dependsupon a number of factors, including:  Its ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates;   Its ability to negotiate favorable acquisition terms, including purchase price,which may be adversely affected due to increased competition with other buyers;   The availability of financing on favorable terms, or at all;   Its ability to integrate effectively the systems and operations of acquiredhospices;   Its ability to retain key personnel of acquired hospices; and   Its ability to obtain required regulatory approvals.     Acquisitions involve a number of other risks, including diversion of managements attentionfrom other business concerns and assuming known or unknown liabilities of acquired hospices,including liabilities for failure to comply with health care laws and regulations. Integratingacquired hospices may place significant strains on Vitas current operating and financial systemsand controls. Vitas may not successfully overcome these risks or any other problems encountered inconnection with its acquisition strategy.     In addition, since 1990, Vitas has acquired hospice programs, some of which involvedacquisitions of hospice programs from not-for-profit entities. Vitas believes that acquisitions ofnot-for-profit programs are generally more complex than acquisitions from for-profit entities andthat a substantial number of acquisition opportunities are likely to involve acquisitions fromnot-for-profit entities. Such acquisitions are subject to23Table of Contentsprovisions of the Internal Revenue Code and, in certain states, state attorney general powers,which have been interpreted to require that the consideration paid for the assets purchased be atfair market value and, where applicable, that any fees paid for services be reasonable. In manystates there is no mechanism for state attorney general pre-clearance of transactions to assurethat applicable standards have been met. Entities that acquired not-for-profit hospices could facepotential liability if the acquisition transaction is not structured to comply with InternalRevenue Code and state law requirements, and in some cases the transaction could be enjoined orsubject to rescission. The acquisition of not-for-profit businesses, including the fairness of thepurchase price paid, has received increasing regulatory scrutiny by state attorneys general andother regulatory authorities. Although Vitas believes that reasonable actions have been taken todate to establish the fair market value of assets purchased in prior acquisitions of hospiceoperations from not-for-profit entities and the reasonableness of fees paid for services, we cannotassure you that such transactions or any future similar transactions will not be challenged orthat, if challenged, the results of such challenge would not have a material adverse effect onVitas business.Vitas loss of key management personnel or its inability to hire and retain skilled employees couldadversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.     Vitas future success significantly depends upon the continued service of its seniormanagement personnel. The loss of one or more of Vitas key senior management personnel or itsinability to hire and retain new skilled employees could negatively impact Vitas ability tomaintain or increase patient referrals, a key aspect of its growth strategy, and could adverselyaffect its future operating results.     Competition for skilled employees is intense, and the process of locating and recruitingskilled employees with the combination of qualifications and attributes required to careeffectively for terminally ill patients and their families can be difficult and lengthy. We cannotassure you that Vitas will be successful in attracting, retaining or training highly skillednursing, management, community education, operations, admissions and other personnel. Vitasbusiness could be disrupted and its growth and profitability negatively impacted if it is unable toattract and retain skilled employees.A nationwide shortage of qualified nurses could adversely affect Vitas profitability, growthand ability to continue to provide quality, responsive hospice services to its patients as nursingwages and benefits increase.     The substantial majority of Vitas workforce is nurses. Vitas depends on qualified nurses toprovide quality, responsive hospice services to its patients. The current nationwide shortage ofqualified nurses impacts some of the markets in which Vitas provides hospice services. In responseto this shortage, Vitas has adjusted its wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and toengage contract nurses. Vitas inability to attract and retain qualified nurses could adverselyaffect its ability to provide quality, responsive hospice services to its patients and its abilityto increase or maintain patient census in those markets. Increases in the wages and benefitsrequired to attract and retain qualified nurses or an increase in reliance on contract nurses couldnegatively impact profitability.Vitas may not be able to compete successfully against other hospice providers, and competitivepressures may limit its ability to maintain or increase its market position and adversely affectits profitability, financial condition and results of operations.     Hospice care in the United States is highly competitive. In many areas in which Vitashospices are located, they compete with a large number of organizations, including:  Community-based hospice providers;   National and regional companies;   Hospital-based hospice and palliative care programs;   Physician groups;24Table of Contents  Nursing homes;   Home health agencies;   Infusion therapy companies; and   Nursing agencies.     Various health care companies have diversified into the hospice market. Other companies,including hospitals and health care organizations that are not currently providing hospice care,may enter the markets Vitas serves and expand the variety of services offered to include hospicecare. We cannot assure you that Vitas will not encounter increased competition in the future thatcould limit its ability to maintain or increase its market position, including competition fromparties in a position to impact referrals to Vitas. Such increased competition could have amaterial adverse effect on Vitas business, financial condition and results of operations.Changes in rates or methods of payment for Vitas services could adversely affect its revenues andprofits.     Managed care organizations have grown substantially in terms of the percentage of thepopulation they cover and their control over an increasing portion of the health care economy.Managed care organizations have continued to consolidate to enhance their ability to influence thedelivery of health care services and to exert pressure to control health care costs. Vitas has anumber of contractual arrangements with managed care organizations and other similar parties.     Vitas provides hospice care to many Medicare beneficiaries who receive their non-hospicehealth care services from health maintenance organizations (HMOs) under Medicare risk contracts.Under such contracts between HMOs and the federal Department of Health and Human Services, theMedicare payments for hospice services are excluded from the per-member, per-month payment fromMedicare to HMOs and instead are paid directly by Medicare to the hospices. As a result, Vitaspayments for Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare risk HMOs are processed in the same waywith the same rates as other Medicare beneficiaries. We cannot assure, however, that payment forhospice services will continue to be excluded from HMO payment under Medicare risk contracts andsimilar Medicare managed care plans or that if not excluded, managed care organization or otherlarge third-party payors would not use their power to influence and exert pressure on health careproviders to reduce costs in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on Vitas business,financial condition and results of operations.Liability claims may have an adverse effect on Vitas, and its insurance coverage may be inadequate.     Participants in the hospice industry are subject to lawsuits alleging negligence, productliability or other similar legal theories, many of which involve large claims and significantdefense costs. From time to time, Vitas is subject to such and other types of lawsuits. See thedescription below under Legal Proceedings. The ultimate liability for claims, if any, could have amaterial adverse effect on its financial condition or operating results. Although Vitas currentlymaintains liability insurance intended to cover the claims, we cannot assure you that the coveragelimits of such insurance policies will be adequate or that all such claims will be covered by theinsurance. In addition, Vitas insurance policies must be renewed annually and may be subject tocancellation during the policy period. While Vitas has been able to obtain liability insurance inthe past, such insurance varies in cost, is difficult to obtain and may not be available in thefuture on terms acceptable to Vitas, if at all.     A successful claim in excess of the insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect onVitas. Claims, regardless of their merit or eventual outcome, also may have a material adverseeffect on Vitas business and reputation due to the costs of litigation, diversion of managementstime and related publicity.25Table of Contents     Vitas procures professional liability coverage on a claims-made basis. The insurancecontracts specify that coverage is available only during the term of each insurance contract.Vitas management intends to renew or replace the existing claims-made policy annually but suchcoverage is difficult to obtain, may be subject to cancellation and may be written by carriers thatare unable, or unwilling to pay claims. During fiscal 2001, Vitas was notified that one of itsprior carriers was ordered into rehabilitation, and in early fiscal 2002, into liquidation,creating the possibility that certain prior year claims could be underinsured or uninsured.Certain claims have been asserted where the coverage would be the responsibility of this priorcarrier and/or other carriers that may not have the financial wherewithal to satisfy the claims.Additionally, some risks and liabilities, including claims for punitive damages, are not covered byinsurance"

     You should carefully consider the risks described below. They are not the only ones facingthe Company. Other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we deem to beimmaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or resultsof operations.GENERAL     We have incurred debt to finance the operations of the Company. We reduced our outstandingdebt by $15 million in 2008.     The Company has debt service obligations that may restrict our operating flexibility. Wecannot assure you that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to service our debt, whichmay require us to borrow additional funds, or restructure or otherwise refinance our debt. Inaddition, the Company has the ability to expand its debt and borrowing capacity subject to variousrestrictions and covenants defined by its creditors. The interest rate the Company pays willfluctuate from time to time based upon a number of factors including current LIBOR rates andCompany operating performance. Significant changes in these factors could result in a materialchange in the Companys interest expense.     Our indebtedness could have important consequences for our business. Among other things, ourindebtedness may:  Limit our ability to obtain additional financing;   Limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the marketsin which we compete;   Place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with lessindebtedness;   Increase our exposure to interest rate increases due to variable interest rateson certain borrowings;   Limit our ability to complete future acquisitions;   Limit our ability to make capital expenditures;   Render us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and   Require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to service and repay our debt.     Servicing our indebtedness will require a significant amount of cash, and our ability togenerate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.     Our ability to repay or to refinance our indebtedness and to pay interest on our indebtednesswill depend on our operating performance, which may be affected by factors beyond our control.These factors could include operating difficulties, increased operating costs, our competitorsactions and regulatory developments. Our ability to meet our debt service and other obligationsmay depend in significant part on the extent to which we successfully15Table of Contentsimplement our business strategy. We cannot assure you that we will be able to implement ourstrategy fully or that the anticipated results of our strategy will be realized. Current creditmarket conditions may make it difficult for us to obtain new financing or refinance our currentdebt on terms and conditions acceptable to us.     If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations,we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional equitycapital or restructure our debt. We cannot assure you that our cash flows and capital resourceswill be sufficient to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness in thefuture or that alternative measures would successfully meet our debt service obligations.     As certain of our obligations under our credit facilities and certain other borrowings couldbear interest at floating rates, an increase in interest rates could further increase our debtservice costs and adversely affect our cash flows.     We have debt that is convertible into shares based on the Companys stock price. This couldsignificantly dilute the ownership percentage of current stockholders.The agreements and instruments governing our outstanding debt contain restrictions and limitationsthat could significantly impact our ability to operate our business and adversely affect the priceof our Capital Stock.     The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our instruments of indebtednessrestrict our ability to:  Incur additional debt;   Pay dividends, make redemptions and purchases of Capital Stock and make otherrestricted payments;   Issue and sell capital stock of subsidiaries;   Sell assets;   Engage in transactions with affiliates;   Restrict distributions from subsidiaries;   Incur liens;   Engage in business other than permitted businesses;   Engage in sale/leaseback transactions;   Engage in mergers or consolidations;   Make capital expenditures;   Make guarantees;   Make investments and acquisitions;16Table of Contents  Enter into operating leases;   Hedge interest rates; and   Prepay other debt.     Moreover, if we are unable to meet the terms of the financial covenants or if we breach any ofthese covenants, a default could result under one or more of these agreements. A default, if notwaived by our lenders, could accelerate repayment of our outstanding indebtedness. If accelerationoccurs, we may not be able to repay our debt and it is unlikely that we would be able to borrowsufficient additional funds to refinance such debt on acceptable terms. In the event of anydefault under our credit facilities, the lenders thereunder could elect to declare all outstandingborrowings, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, to be due and payable, and torequire us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings, any of which would be anevent of default.We depend on our management team and the loss of their service could have a material adverse effecton our business, financial condition and results of operations.     Our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of our executive managementteam. The loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financialcondition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, we cannot assure you that we will beable to attract or retain other skilled personnel in the future.Environmental compliance costs and liabilities could increase our expenses and adversely affect ourfinancial condition.     Our operations are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulationsthat prohibit or restrict the discharge of pollutants into the environment and regulate employeeexposure to hazardous substance in the workplace. Failure to comply with these laws could subjectus to material costs and liabilities, including civil and criminal fines, costs to cleanupcontamination we cause and, in some circumstances, costs to cleanup contamination we discover onour own property but did not cause.     Because we use and generate hazardous materials in some of our operations, we are potentiallysubject to material liabilities relating to the cleanup of contamination and personal injuryclaims. In addition, we have retained certain environmental liabilities in connection with thesale of former businesses. We are currently funding the cleanup of historical contamination at oneof our former properties and contributing to the cleanup of third-party sites as a result of oursale of our former subsidiary DuBois Chemicals Inc. Although we have established a reserve forthese liabilities, actual cleanup costs may exceed our current estimates due to factors beyond ourcontrol, such as the discovery of additional contamination or the enforcement of more stringentcleanup requirements. New laws and regulations or their stricter enforcement, the discovery ofpresently unknown conditions or the receipt of additional claims for indemnification could requireus to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a materialadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to certain anti-takeover statutes that might make it more difficult to effect achange in control of the Company.     We are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware GeneralCorporation Law, which prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with an interestedstockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the personbecame an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribedmanner. The application of Section 203 could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change ofcontrol that could be advantageous to stockholders.17Table of ContentsAn adverse ruling against us in certain litigation could have an adverse effect on our financialcondition and results of operations.     We are involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of our business currently and fromtime to time. The damages claimed against us in some of these cases are substantial.     See the Legal Proceedings sections of this 10-K for discussion of particular matters.     We cannot assure you that we will prevail in pending cases. Regardless of the outcome, suchlitigation is costly to manage, investigate and defend, and the related defense costs, diversion ofmanagements time and related publicity may adversely affect the conduct of our business and theresults of our operations.ROTO-ROOTERWe face intense competition from numerous, fragmented competitors. If we do not competeeffectively, our business may suffer.     We face intense competition from numerous competitors, many of whom have less leverage than wedo. The sewer, drain and pipe cleaning, and plumbing repair businesses are highly fragmented, withthe bulk of the industries consisting of local and regional competitors. We compete primarily onthe basis of advertising, range of services provided, name recognition, speed and quality ofcustomer service, service guarantees and pricing. Our competitors may succeed in developing new orenhanced products and services more successful than ours and in marketing and selling existing andnew products and services better than we do. In addition, new competitors may emerge. We cannotmake any assurances that we will continue to be able to compete successfully with any of thesecompanies.Our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations, exposing us to potential claims andcompliance costs that could adversely affect our business.     We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to franchising,insurance and other aspects of our business. These are discussed in greater detail underGovernment Regulations in the Description of Business section hereof. If we fail to comply withexisting or future laws and regulations, we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines andsanctions. Our franchising activities are subject to various federal and state franchising lawsand regulations, including the rules and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission (the FTC)regarding the offering or sale of franchises. The rules and regulations of the FTC require us toprovide all of our prospective franchisees with specific information regarding us and our franchiseprogram in the form of a detailed franchise offering circular. In addition, a number of statesrequire us to register our franchise offering prior to offering or selling franchises in suchstates. Various state laws also provide for certain rights in favor of franchisees, including (i)limitations on the franchisors ability to terminate a franchise except for good cause, (ii)restrictions on the franchisors ability to deny renewal of a franchise, (iii) circumstances underwhich the franchisor may be required to purchase certain inventory of franchisees when a franchiseis terminated or not renewed in violation of such laws and (iv) provisions relating to arbitration.The ability to engage in the plumbing repair business is also subject to certain limitations andrestrictions imposed by the state and local licensing laws and regulations. We cannot predictwhat legislation or regulations affecting our business will be enacted in the future, how existingor future laws or regulations will be enforced, administered and interpreted, or the amount offuture expenditures that may be required to comply with these laws or regulations. Compliancecosts associated with governmental regulations could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.18Table of ContentsVITAS Vitas is highly dependent on payments from Medicare and Medicaid. If there are changes in the rateor methods governing these payments, Vitas net patient service revenue and profits couldmaterially decline.     In excess of 90% of Vitas net patient service revenue consists of payments from the Medicareand Medicaid programs. Such payments are made primarily on a per diem basis, subject to annualreimbursement caps. Because Vitas receives a per diem fee to provide eligible services to allpatients, Vitas profitability is largely dependent upon its ability to manage the costs ofproviding hospice services to patients. Increases in operating costs, such as labor and supplycosts that are subject to inflation, without a compensating increase in Medicare and Medicaidrates, could have a material adverse effect on Vitas business in the future. Medicare andMedicaid currently adjust the various hospice payment rates annually based on the increase ordecrease of the hospital wage index basket, regionally adjusted. However, the increases may beless than actual inflation. Vitas profitability could be negatively impacted if this adjustmentwere eliminated or reduced, or if Vitas costs of providing hospice services increased more thanthe annual adjustment. In addition, cost pressures resulting from shorter patient lengths of stayand the use of more expensive forms of palliative care, including drugs and drug delivery systems,could negatively impact Vitas profitability. Many payors are increasing pressure to controlhealth care costs. In addition, both public and private payors are increasing pressure todecrease, or limit increases in, reimbursement rates for health care services. Vitas levels ofrevenue and profitability will be subject to the effect of possible reductions in coverage orpayment rates by third-party payors, including payment rates from Medicare and Medicaid.     Each state that maintains a Medicaid program has the option to provide reimbursement forhospice services at reimbursement rates generally required to be at least as much as Medicarerates. All states in which Vitas operates cover Medicaid hospice services; however, we cannotassure you that the states in which Vitas is presently operating or states into which Vitas couldexpand operations will continue to cover Medicaid hospice services. In addition, the Medicare andMedicaid programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive and prospective rateand payment adjustments, administrative rulings, freezes and funding reductions, all of which mayadversely affect the level of program payments and could have a material adverse effect on Vitasbusiness. We cannot assure that Medicare and/or Medicaid payments to hospices will not decrease.Reductions in amounts paid by government programs for services or changes in methods or regulationsgoverning payments could cause Vitas net patient service revenue and profits to materiallydecline.Approximately one-third of Vitas hospice patients reside in nursing homes. Changes in the laws andregulations regarding payments for hospice services and room and board provided to Vitas hospicepatients residing in nursing homes could reduce its net patient service revenue and profitability.     For Vitas hospice patients receiving nursing home care under certain state Medicaid programswho elect hospice care under Medicare and Medicaid, the state generally must pay Vitas, in additionto the applicable Medicare or Medicaid hospice per diem rate, an amount equal to at least 95% ofthe Medicaid per diem nursing home rate for room and board furnished to the patient by thenursing home. Vitas contracts with various nursing homes for the nursing homes provision ofcertain room and board services that the nursing homes would otherwise provide Medicaid nursinghome patients. Vitas bills and collects from the applicable state Medicaid program an amount equalto approximately 95% of the amount that would otherwise have been paid directly to the nursing homeunder the states Medicaid plan. Under Vitas standard nursing home contracts, it pays the nursinghome for these room and board services at approximately 100% of the Medicaid per diem nursinghome rate.     The reduction or elimination of Medicare and Medicaid payments for hospice patients residingin nursing homes would reduce Vitas net patient service revenue and profitability. In addition,changes in the way nursing homes are reimbursed for room and board services provided to hospicepatients residing in nursing homes could effect Vitas ability to serve patients in nursing homes.19Table of ContentsIf Vitas is unable to maintain relationships with existing patient referral sources or to establishnew referral sources, Vitas growth and profitability could be adversely affected.     Vitas success is heavily dependent on referrals from physicians, long-term care facilities,hospitals and other institutional health care providers, managed care companies, insurancecompanies and other patient referral sources in the communities that its hospice locations serve,as well as on its ability to maintain good relations with these referral sources. Vitas referralsources may refer their patients to other hospice care providers or not to a hospice provider atall. Vitas growth and profitability depend significantly on its ability to establish and maintainclose working relationships with these patient referral sources and to increase awareness andacceptance of hospice care by its referral sources and their patients. We cannot assure you thatVitas will be able to maintain its existing relationships or that it will be able to develop andmaintain new relationships in existing or new markets. Vitas loss of existing relationships orits failure to develop new relationships could adversely affect its ability to expand or maintainits operations and operate profitably. Moreover, we cannot assure you that awareness or acceptanceof hospice care will increase or remain at current levels.Vitas operates in an industry that is subject to extensive government regulation and claimsreviews, and changes in law and regulatory interpretations could reduce its net patient servicerevenue and profitability and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.     The healthcare industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws, rules andregulations relating to, among others:  Payment for services;   Conduct of operations, including fraud and abuse, anti-kickback prohibitions,self-referral prohibitions and false claims;   Privacy and security of medical records;   Employment practices; and   Various state approval requirements, such as facility and professionallicensure, certificate of need, compliance surveys and other certification orrecertification requirements.     Changes in these laws, rules and regulations or in interpretations thereof could reduce Vitasnet patient service revenue and profitability. Vitas ability to comply with such regulations is akey factor in determining the success of its business. See the Government Regulations section ofthis 10-K for a greater description of these matters.     Fraud and Abuse Laws. Vitas contracts with a significant number of health care providers andpractitioners, including physicians, hospitals and nursing homes and arranges for these entities toprovide services to Vitas patients. Some of these health care providers and practitioners mayrefer, or be in a position to refer, patients to Vitas (or Vitas may refer patients to them).These arrangements may not qualify for a safe harbor. Vitas from time to time seeks guidance fromregulatory counsel as to the changing and evolving interpretations and the potential applicabilityof the Anti-Kickback Law to its programs, and in response thereto, takes such actions as it deemsappropriate. Vitas generally believes that its contracts and arrangements with providers,practitioners and suppliers should not be found to violate the Anti-Kickback Law. However, wecannot assure you that such laws will ultimately be interpreted in a manner consistent with Vitaspractices.     Several health care reform proposals have included an expansion of the Anti-Kickback Law toinclude referrals of any patients regardless of payor source, which is similar to the scope ofcertain laws that have been enacted at the state level. In addition, a number of states in whichVitas operates have laws, which vary from state20Table of Contentsto state, prohibiting certain direct or indirect remuneration or fee-splitting arrangements betweenhealth care providers, regardless of payor source, for the referral of patients to a particularprovider.     The federal Ethics in Patient Referral Act, Section 1877 of the Social Security Act (commonlyknown as the Stark Law) prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients fordesignated health services to entities in which they hold an ownership or investment interest orwith whom they have a compensation arrangement, subject to certain statutory or regulatoryexceptions. We cannot assure you that future statutory or regulatory changes will not result inhospice services being subject to the Stark Laws ownership, investment, compensation or referralprohibitions. Several states in which Vitas operates have similar laws which likewise are subjectto change. Any such changes could adversely affect the business, financial condition and operatingresults of Vitas.     Further, under separate statutes, submission of claims for items or services that are notprovided as claimed may lead to civil money penalties, criminal fines and imprisonment and/orexclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federally funded state health careprograms. These false claims statutes include the federal False Claims Act, which allows anyperson to bring suit on behalf of the federal government, known as a qui tam action, alleging falseor fraudulent Medicare or Medicaid claims or other violations of the statute and to share in anyamounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. See the discussion of thegovernmental investigation pending against Vitas under Other Healthcare Regulations, above.     Certificate of Need Laws. Many states, including Florida, have certificate of need laws orother similar health planning laws that apply to hospice care providers. These states may requiresome form of state agency review or approval prior to opening a new hospice program, to adding orexpanding hospice services, to undertaking significant capital expenditures or under otherspecified circumstances. Approval under these certificate of need laws is generally conditioned onthe showing of a demonstrable need for services in the community. Vitas may seek to develop,acquire or expand hospice programs in states having certificate of need laws. To the extent thatstate agencies require Vitas to obtain a certificate of need or other similar approvals to expandservices at existing hospice programs or to make acquisitions or develop hospice programs in new orexisting geographical markets, Vitas plans could be adversely affected by a failure to obtain acertificate or approval. In addition, competitors may seek administratively or judicially tochallenge such an approval or proposed approval by the state agency. Such a challenge, whether ornot ultimately successful, could adversely affect Vitas.     Other Federal and State Regulations. The federal government and all states regulate variousaspects of the hospice industry and Vitas business. In particular, Vitas operations are subjectto federal and state health regulatory laws, including those covering professional services, thedispensing of drugs and certain types of hospice activities. Certain of Vitas employees aresubject to state laws and regulations governing professional practice. Vitas operations aresubject to periodic survey by governmental authorities and private accrediting entities to assurecompliance with applicable state licensing, and Medicare and Medicaid certification andaccreditation standards, as the case may be. From time to time in the ordinary course of business,Vitas receives survey reports noting deficiencies for alleged failure to comply with applicablerequirements. Vitas reviews such reports and takes appropriate corrective action. The failure toeffect such action could result in one of Vitas hospice programs being terminated from theMedicare hospice program. Any termination of one or more of Vitas hospice locations from theMedicare hospice program could adversely affect Vitas net patient service revenue andprofitability and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. The failureto obtain, renew or maintain any of the required regulatory approvals, certifications or licensescould materially adversely affect Vitas business and could prevent the programs involved fromoffering products and services to patients. In addition, laws and regulations often are adopted toregulate new products, services and industries. We cannot assure you that either the states or thefederal government will not impose additional regulations on Vitas activities, which mightmaterially adversely affect Vitas.     Claims Review. The Medicare and Medicaid programs and their fiscal intermediaries and otherpayors periodically conduct pre-payment or post-payment reviews and other reviews and audits ofhealth care claims,21Table of Contentsincluding hospice claims. As a result of such reviews or audits, Vitas could be required to returnany amounts found to be overpaid, or amounts found to be overpaid could be recouped throughreductions in future payments. There is pressure from state and federal governments and otherpayors to scrutinize health care claims to determine their validity and appropriateness. Duringthe past several years, Vitas claims have been subject to review and audit. We cannot assure youthat reviews and/or similar audits of Vitas claims will not result in material recoupments,denials or other actions that could have a material adverse effect on Vitas business, financialcondition and results of operations. See the discussion of OIG investigation pending against Vitasunder Other Health Care Regulations, above.     Regulation and Provision of Continuous Home Care. Vitas provides continuous home care topatients requiring such care. Continuous home care is provided to patients while at home, duringperiods of crisis when intensive monitoring and care, primarily nursing care, is required in orderto achieve palliation or management of acute medical symptoms. Continuous home care requires aminimum of 8 hours of care within a 24-hour day, which begins and ends at midnight. The care mustbe predominantly nursing care provided by either a registered nurse or licensed practical nurse.     Continuous home care can be challenging for a hospice to provide for a number of reasons,including the need to have available sufficient skilled and trained staff to furnish such care, theneed to manage the staffing and provision of such care, and a shortage of nurses that can make itparticularly difficult to attract and retain nurses that are required to furnish a majority of suchcare. Medicare reimbursement for continuous home care has been calculated by multiplying theapplicable continuous home care hourly rate by the number of hours of care provided. If the carewas provided for less than one hour, Medicare regulations allowed for rounding to the next hourincrement. Effective January 1, 2007, Medicare requires reporting in 15-minute increments of careprovided, with no rounding.     Medicare reimbursement for continuous home care is subject to a number of requirements posingfurther challenges for a hospice providing such care. For example, if a patient requires skilledinterventions for palliation or symptom management that can be accomplished in less than 8aggregate hours within the 24-hour period, if the majority of care can be accomplished by someoneother than a registered nurse or a licensed practical nurse (e.g., if a majority of care isfurnished by a home health aide or homemaker), or if for any reason less than 8 hours of directcare are provided (such as when a patient dies before 8 AM even if 7 or more hours of care has beenprovided), the care rendered cannot be reimbursed by Medicare at the continuous home care rate(although the care instead may be eligible for Medicare reimbursement at the reduced routine homecare day rate). As a result of such requirements, Vitas may incur the costs of providing servicesintended to be continuous home care services yet be unable to bill or be reimbursed for suchservices at the continuous home care rate. We cannot assure you that challenges in providingcontinuous home care will not cause Vitas net patient service revenue and profits to materiallydecline or that reviews and/or similar audits of Vitas claims will not result in materialrecoupments, denials or other actions that could have a material adverse effect on Vitas business,financial condition and results of operations.     Compliance. Vitas maintains an internal regulatory compliance review program and from time totime retains regulatory counsel for guidance on compliance matters. We cannot assure you, however,that Vitas practices, if reviewed, would be found to be in compliance with applicable healthregulatory laws, as such laws ultimately may be interpreted, or that any non-compliance with suchlaws would not have a material adverse effect on Vitas.Federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to patient privacy could requireVitas to expend substantial sums on acquiring, implementing and supporting new information systems,which could negatively impact its profitability.     There are currently numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives at both the state andfederal levels that address patient privacy concerns. In particular, regulations issued under theHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) require Vitas to protect theprivacy and security of patients individual22Table of Contentshealth information. We cannot predict the total financial or other impact of the regulations onVitas operations. In addition, although Vitas management believes it is in compliance with therequirement of patient privacy regulations, we cannot assure you that Vitas will not be found tohave violated state and federal laws, rules or guidelines surrounding patient privacy. Compliancewith current and future HIPAA requirements or any other federal or state privacy initiatives couldrequire Vitas to make substantial investments, which could negatively impact its profitability andcash flows.Vitas growth strategies may not be successful, which could adversely affect its business.     A significant element of Vitas growth strategy is expected to include expansion of itsbusiness in new and existing markets. This aspect of Vitas growth strategy may not be successful,which could adversely impact its growth and profitability. We cannot assure you that Vitas will beable to:  Identify markets that meet its selection criteria for new hospice locations;   Hire and retain qualified management teams to operate each of its new hospicelocations;   Manage a large and geographically diverse group of hospice locations;   Become Medicare and Medicaid certified in new markets;   Generate sufficient hospice admissions in new markets to operate profitably inthese new markets;   Compete effectively with existing hospices in new markets; or   Obtain state licensure and/or a certificate of need from appropriate stateagencies in new markets.     In addition to growing existing locations and developing new hospice locations, Vitas growthis expected to include expansion through acquisition of other hospices. We cannot assure you thatVitas acquisition strategy will be successful. The success of Vitas acquisition strategy dependsupon a number of factors, including:  Its ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates;   Its ability to negotiate favorable acquisition terms, including purchase price,which may be adversely affected due to increased competition with other buyers;   The availability of financing on favorable terms, or at all;   Its ability to integrate effectively the systems and operations of acquiredhospices;   Its ability to retain key personnel of acquired hospices; and   Its ability to obtain required regulatory approvals.     Acquisitions involve a number of other risks, including diversion of managements attentionfrom other business concerns and assuming known or unknown liabilities of acquired hospices,including liabilities for failure to comply with health care laws and regulations. Integratingacquired hospices may place significant strains on Vitas current operating and financial systemsand controls. Vitas may not successfully overcome these risks or any other problems encountered inconnection with its acquisition strategy.23Table of Contents     In addition, since 1990, Vitas has acquired hospice programs, some of which involvedacquisitions of hospice programs from not-for-profit entities. Vitas believes that acquisitions ofnot-for-profit programs are generally more complex than acquisitions from for-profit entities andthat a substantial number of acquisition opportunities are likely to involve acquisitions fromnot-for-profit entities. Such acquisitions are subject to provisions of the Internal Revenue Codeand, in certain states, state attorney general powers, which have been interpreted to require thatthe consideration paid for the assets purchased be at fair market value and, where applicable, thatany fees paid for services be reasonable. In many states there is no mechanism for state attorneygeneral pre-clearance of transactions to assure that applicable standards have been met. Entitiesthat acquired not-for-profit hospices could face potential liability if the acquisition transactionis not structured to comply with Internal Revenue Code and state law requirements, and in somecases the transaction could be enjoined or subject to rescission. The acquisition ofnot-for-profit businesses, including the fairness of the purchase price paid, has receivedincreasing regulatory scrutiny by state attorneys general and other regulatory authorities.Although Vitas believes that reasonable actions have been taken to date to establish the fairmarket value of assets purchased in prior acquisitions of hospice operations from not-for-profitentities and the reasonableness of fees paid for services, we cannot assure you that suchtransactions or any future similar transactions will not be challenged or that, if challenged, theresults of such challenge would not have a material adverse effect on Vitas business.Vitas loss of key management personnel or its inability to hire and retain skilled employees couldadversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.     Vitas future success significantly depends upon the continued service of its seniormanagement personnel. The loss of one or more of Vitas key senior management personnel or itsinability to hire and retain new skilled employees could negatively impact Vitas ability tomaintain or increase patient referrals, a key aspect of its growth strategy, and could adverselyaffect its future operating results.     Competition for skilled employees is intense, and the process of locating and recruitingskilled employees with the combination of qualifications and attributes required to careeffectively for terminally ill patients and their families can be difficult and lengthy. We cannotassure you that Vitas will be successful in attracting, retaining or training highly skillednursing, management, community education, operations, admissions and other personnel. Vitasbusiness could be disrupted and its growth and profitability negatively impacted if it is unable toattract and retain skilled employees.A nationwide shortage of qualified nurses could adversely affect Vitas profitability, growth andability to continue to provide quality, responsive hospice services to its patients as nursingwages and benefits increase.     The substantial majority of Vitas workforce is nurses. Vitas depends on qualified nurses toprovide quality, responsive hospice services to its patients. The current nationwide shortage ofqualified nurses impacts some of the markets in which Vitas provides hospice services. In responseto this shortage, Vitas has adjusted its wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and toengage contract nurses. Vitas inability to attract and retain qualified nurses could adverselyaffect its ability to provide quality, responsive hospice services to its patients and its abilityto increase or maintain patient census in those markets. Increases in the wages and benefitsrequired to attract and retain qualified nurses or an increase in reliance on contract nurses couldnegatively impact profitability.Vitas may not be able to compete successfully against other hospice providers, and competitivepressures may limit its ability to maintain or increase its market position and adversely affectits profitability, financial condition and results of operations.     Hospice care in the United States is highly competitive. In many areas in which Vitashospices are located, they compete with a large number of organizations, including:  Community-based hospice providers;   National and regional companies;24Table of Contents  Hospital-based hospice and palliative care programs;   Physician groups;   Nursing homes;   Home health agencies;   Infusion therapy companies; and   Nursing agencies.     Various health care companies have diversified into the hospice market. Other companies,including hospitals and health care organizations that are not currently providing hospice care,may enter the markets Vitas serves and expand the variety of services offered to include hospicecare. We cannot assure you that Vitas will not encounter increased competition in the future thatcould limit its ability to maintain or increase its market position, including competition fromparties in a position to impact referrals to Vitas. Such increased competition could have amaterial adverse effect on Vitas business, financial condition and results of operations.Changes in rates or methods of payment for Vitas services could adversely affect its revenues andprofits.     Managed care organizations have grown substantially in terms of the percentage of thepopulation they cover and their control over an increasing portion of the health care economy.Managed care organizations have continued to consolidate to enhance their ability to influence thedelivery of health care services and to exert pressure to control health care costs. Vitas has anumber of contractual arrangements with managed care organizations and other similar parties.     Vitas provides hospice care to many Medicare beneficiaries who receive their non-hospicehealth care services from health maintenance organizations (HMOs) under Medicare risk contracts.Under such contracts between HMOs and the federal Department of Health and Human Services, theMedicare payments for hospice services are excluded from the per-member, per-month payment fromMedicare to HMOs and instead are paid directly by Medicare to the hospices. As a result, Vitaspayments for Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare risk HMOs are processed in the same waywith the same rates as other Medicare beneficiaries. We cannot assure, however, that payment forhospice services will continue to be excluded from HMO payment under Medicare risk contracts andsimilar Medicare managed care plans or that if not excluded, managed care organization or otherlarge third-party payors would not use their power to influence and exert pressure on health careproviders to reduce costs in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on Vitas business,financial condition and results of operations.Liability claims may have an adverse effect on Vitas, and its insurance coverage may be inadequate.     Participants in the hospice industry are subject to lawsuits alleging negligence, productliability or other similar legal theories, many of which involve large claims and significantdefense costs. From time to time, Vitas is subject to such and other types of lawsuits. See thedescription below under Legal Proceedings. The ultimate liability for claims, if any, could have amaterial adverse effect on its financial condition or operating results. Although Vitas currentlymaintains liability insurance intended to cover the claims, we cannot assure you that the coveragelimits of such insurance policies will be adequate or that all such claims will be covered by theinsurance. In addition, Vitas insurance policies must be renewed annually and may be subject tocancellation during the policy period. While Vitas has been able to obtain liability insurance inthe past, such insurance varies in cost, is difficult to obtain and may not be available in thefuture on terms acceptable to Vitas, if at all.25Table of Contents     A successful claim in excess of the insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect onVitas. Claims, regardless of their merit or eventual outcome, also may have a material adverseeffect on Vitas business and reputation due to the costs of litigation, diversion of managementstime and related publicity.     Vitas procures professional liability coverage on a claims-made basis. The insurancecontracts specify that coverage is available only during the term of each insurance contract.Vitas management intends to renew or replace the existing claims-made policy annually but suchcoverage is difficult to obtain, may be subject to cancellation and may be written by carriers thatare unable, or unwilling to pay claims. During fiscal 2001, Vitas was notified that one of itsprior carriers was ordered into rehabilitation, and in early fiscal 2002, into liquidation,creating the possibility that certain prior year claims could be underinsured or uninsured.Certain claims have been asserted where the coverage would be the responsibility of this priorcarrier and/or other carriers that may not have the financial wherewithal to satisfy the claims.Additionally, some risks and liabilities, including claims for punitive damages, are not covered byinsurance"
1,CHE,CHEMED CORP,2008-02-28,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
     You should carefully consider the risks described below. They are not the only ones facingthe Company. Other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we deem to beimmaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or resultsof operations.GENERAL     We have incurred debt to finance the operations of the Company. We increased our outstandingdebt by $74.3 million in 2007. Our leverage may limit cash flow available for our operations,could adversely affect our ability to service our debt or obtain additional financing and couldadversely affect our financial health and our ability to react to changes in our business.     The Company has debt service obligations that may restrict our operating flexibility. Wecannot assure you that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to service our debt, whichmay require us to borrow additional funds, or restructure or otherwise refinance our debt. Inaddition, the Company has the ability to expand its debt and borrowing capacity subject to variousrestrictions and covenants defined by its creditors. The interest rate the Company pays willfluctuate from time to time based upon a number of factors including current LIBOR rates andCompany operating performance. Significant changes in these factors could result in a materialchange in the Companys interest expense.     Our indebtedness could have important consequences for our business. Among other things, ourindebtedness may:  Limit our ability to obtain additional financing;   Limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the marketsin which we compete;   Place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with lessindebtedness;   Increase our exposure to interest rate increases due to variable interest rateson certain borrowings;   Limit our ability to complete future acquisitions;   Limit our ability to make capital expenditures;   Render us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions;and   Require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to service andrepay our debt.     Servicing our indebtedness will require a significant amount of cash, and our ability togenerate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.15Table of Contents     Our ability to repay or to refinance our indebtedness and to pay interest on our indebtednesswill depend on our operating performance, which may be affected by factors beyond our control.These factors could include operating difficulties, increased operating costs, our competitorsactions and regulatory developments. Our ability to meet our debt service and other obligationsmay depend in significant part on the extent to which we successfully implement our businessstrategy. We cannot assure you that we will be able to implement our strategy fully or that theanticipated results of our strategy will be realized.     If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations,we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional equitycapital or restructure our debt. We cannot assure you that our cash flows and capital resourceswill be sufficient to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness in thefuture or that alternative measures would successfully meet our debt service obligations.     As certain of our obligations under our credit facilities and certain other borrowings couldbear interest at floating rates, an increase in interest rates could further increase our debtservice costs and adversely affect our cash flows.     We have debt that is convertible into shares based on the Companys stock price. This couldsignificantly dilute the ownership percentage of current stockholders.     The agreements and instruments governing our outstanding debt contain restrictions and limitationsthat could significantly impact our ability to operate our business and adversely affect the priceof our Capital Stock.     The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our instruments of indebtednessrestrict our ability to:  Incur additional debt;   Pay dividends, make redemptions and purchases of Capital Stock and make otherrestricted payments;   Issue and sell capital stock of subsidiaries;   Sell assets;   Engage in transactions with affiliates;   Restrict distributions from subsidiaries;   Incur liens;   Engage in business other than permitted businesses;   Engage in sale/leaseback transactions;   Engage in mergers or consolidations;   Make capital expenditures;   Make guarantees;16Table of Contents  Make investments and acquisitions;   Enter into operating leases;   Hedge interest rates; and   Prepay other debt.     Moreover, if we are unable to meet the terms of the financial covenants or if we breach any ofthese covenants, a default could result under one or more of these agreements. A default, if notwaived by our lenders, could accelerate repayment of our outstanding indebtedness. If accelerationoccurs, we may not be able to repay our debt and it is unlikely that we would be able to borrowsufficient additional funds to refinance such debt on acceptable terms. In the event of anydefault under our credit facilities, the lenders thereunder could elect to declare all outstandingborrowings, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, to be due and payable, torequire us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings, any of which would be anevent of default.We depend on our management team and the loss of their service could have a material adverse effecton our business, financial condition and results of operations.     Our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of our executive managementteam. The loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financialcondition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, we cannot assure you that we will beable to attract or retain other skilled personnel in the future.Environmental compliance costs and liabilities could increase our expenses and adversely affect ourfinancial condition.     Our operations are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulationsthat prohibit or restrict the discharge of pollutants into the environment and regulate employeeexposure to hazardous substance in the workplace. Failure to comply with these laws could subjectus to material costs and liabilities, including civil and criminal fines, costs to cleanupcontamination we cause and, in some circumstances, costs to cleanup contamination we discover onour own property but did not cause.     Because we use and generate hazardous materials in some of our operations, we are potentiallysubject to material liabilities relating to the cleanup of contamination and personal injuryclaims. In addition, we have retained certain environmental liabilities in connection with thesale of former businesses. We are currently funding the cleanup of historical contamination at oneof our former properties and contributing to the cleanup of third-party sites as a result of oursale of DuBois Chemicals Inc. Although we have established a reserve for these liabilities, actualcleanup costs may exceed our current estimates due to factors beyond our control, such as thediscovery of additional contamination or the enforcement of more stringent cleanup requirements.New laws and regulations or their stricter enforcement, the discovery of presently unknownconditions or the receipt of additional claims for indemnification could require us to incur costsor become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect onour business, financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to certain anti-takeover statutes that might make it more difficult to effect achange in control of the Company.     We are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware GeneralCorporation Law, which prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with an interestedstockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the personbecame an interested stockholder, unless the business17Table of Contentscombination is approved in a prescribed manner. The application of Section 203 could have theeffect of delaying or preventing a change of control that could be advantageous to stockholders.An adverse ruling against us in certain litigation could have an adverse effect on our financialcondition and results of operations.     We are involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of our business currently and fromtime to time. The damages claimed against us in some of these cases are substantial.     See the Legal Proceedings sections of this 10-K for discussion of particular matters.     We cannot assure you that we will prevail in pending cases. Regardless of the outcome, suchlitigation is costly to manage, investigate and defend, and the related defense costs, diversion ofmanagements time and related publicity may adversely affect the conduct of our business and theresults of our operations.ROTO-ROOTERWe face intense competition from numerous, fragmented competitors. If we do not competeeffectively, our business may suffer.     We face intense competition from numerous competitors, many of whom have less leverage than wedo. The sewer, drain and pipe cleaning, and plumbing repair businesses are highly fragmented, withthe bulk of the industries consisting of local and regional competitors. We compete primarily onthe basis of advertising, range of services provided, name recognition, speed and quality ofcustomer service, service guarantees and pricing. Our competitors may succeed in developing new orenhanced products and services more successful than ours and in marketing and selling existing andnew products and services better than we do. In addition, new competitors may emerge. We cannotmake any assurances that we will continue to be able to compete successfully with any of thesecompanies.Our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations, exposing us to potential claims andcompliance costs that could adversely affect our business.     We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to franchising,insurance and other aspects of our business. These are discussed in greater detail underGovernment Regulations in the Description of Business section hereof. If we fail to comply withexisting or future laws and regulations, we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines andsanctions. Our franchising activities are subject to various federal and state franchising lawsand regulations, including the rules and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission (the FTC)regarding the offering or sale of franchises. The rules and regulations of the FTC require us toprovide all of our prospective franchisees with specific information regarding us and our franchiseprogram in the form of a detailed franchise offering circular. In addition, a number of statesrequire us to register our franchise offering prior to offering or selling franchises in suchstates. Various state laws also provide for certain rights in favor of franchisees, including (i)limitations on the franchisors ability to terminate a franchise except for good cause, (ii)restrictions on the franchisors ability to deny renewal of a franchise, (iii) circumstances underwhich the franchisor may be required to purchase certain inventory of franchisees when a franchiseis terminated or not renewed in violation of such laws and (iv) provisions relating to arbitration.The ability to engage in the plumbing repair business is also subject to certain limitations andrestrictions imposed by the state and local licensing laws and regulations. We cannot predictwhat legislation or regulations affecting our business will be enacted in the future, how existingor future laws or regulations will be enforced, administered and interpreted, or the amount offuture expenditures that may be required to comply with these laws or regulations. Compliancecosts associated with governmental regulations could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.18Table of ContentsVITAS Vitas is highly dependent on payments from Medicare and Medicaid. If there are changes in the rateor methods governing these payments, Vitas net patient service revenue and profits couldmaterially decline.     In excess of 90% of Vitas net patient service revenue consists of payments from the Medicareand Medicaid programs. Such payments are made primarily on a per diem basis, subject to annualreimbursement caps. Because Vitas receives a per diem fee to provide eligible services to allpatients, Vitas profitability is largely dependent upon its ability to manage the costs ofproviding hospice services to patients. Increases in operating costs, such as labor and supplycosts that are subject to inflation, without a compensating increase in Medicare and Medicaidrates, could have a material adverse effect on Vitas business in the future. Medicare andMedicaid currently adjust the various hospice payment rates annually based on the increase ordecrease of the hospital wage index basket, regionally adjusted. However, the increases may beless than actual inflation. Vitas profitability could be negatively impacted if this adjustmentwere eliminated or reduced, or if Vitas costs of providing hospice services increased more thanthe annual adjustment. In addition, cost pressures resulting from shorter patient lengths of stayand the use of more expensive forms of palliative care, including drugs and drug delivery systems,could negatively impact Vitas profitability. Many payors are increasing pressure to controlhealth care costs. In addition, both public and private payors are increasing pressure todecrease, or limit increases in, reimbursement rates for health care services. Vitas levels ofrevenue and profitability will be subject to the effect of possible reductions in coverage orpayment rates by third-party payors, including payment rates from Medicare and Medicaid.     Each state that maintains a Medicaid program has the option to provide reimbursement forhospice services at reimbursement rates generally required to be at least as much as Medicarerates. Most states in which Vitas operates cover Medicaid hospice services; however, we cannotassure that the states in which Vitas is presently operating or states into which Vitas couldexpand operations will continue to cover Medicaid hospice services. In addition, the Medicare andMedicaid programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive and prospective rateand payment adjustments, administrative rulings, freezes and funding reductions, all of which mayadversely affect the level of program payments and could have a material adverse effect on Vitasbusiness. We cannot assure that Medicare and/or Medicaid payments to hospices will notdecrease. Reductions in amounts paid by government programs for services or changes in methods orregulations governing payments could cause Vitas net patient service revenue and profits tomaterially decline.Approximately one-third of Vitas hospice patients reside in nursing homes. Changes in the laws andregulations regarding payments for hospice services and room and board provided to Vitas hospicepatients residing in nursing homes could reduce its net patient service revenue and profitability.     For Vitas hospice patients receiving nursing home care under certain state Medicaid programswho elect hospice care under Medicare and Medicaid, the state generally must pay Vitas, in additionto the applicable Medicare or Medicaid hospice per diem rate, an amount equal to at least 95% ofthe Medicaid per diem nursing home rate for room and board furnished to the patient by thenursing home. Vitas contracts with various nursing homes for the nursing homes provision ofcertain room and board services that the nursing homes would otherwise provide Medicaid nursinghome patients. Vitas bills and collects from the applicable state Medicaid program an amount equalto approximately 95% of the amount that would otherwise have been paid directly to the nursing homeunder the states Medicaid plan. Under Vitas standard nursing home contracts, it pays the nursinghome for these room and board services at approximately 100% of the Medicaid per diem nursinghome rate.     The reduction or elimination of Medicare and Medicaid payments for hospice patients residingin nursing homes would reduce Vitas net patient service revenue and profitability. In addition,changes in the way nursing homes are reimbursed for room and board services provided to hospicepatients residing in nursing homes could effect Vitas ability to serve patients in nursing homes.19Table of ContentsIf Vitas is unable to maintain relationships with existing patient referral sources or to establishnew referral sources, Vitas growth and profitability could be adversely affected.     Vitas success is heavily dependent on referrals from physicians, long-term care facilities,hospitals and other institutional health care providers, managed care companies, insurancecompanies and other patient referral sources in the communities that its hospice locations serve,as well as on its ability to maintain good relations with these referral sources. Vitas referralsources may refer their patients to other hospice care providers or not to a hospice provider atall. Vitas growth and profitability depend significantly on its ability to establish and maintainclose working relationships with these patient referral sources and to increase awareness andacceptance of hospice care by its referral sources and their patients. We cannot assure you thatVitas will be able to maintain its existing relationships or that it will be able to develop andmaintain new relationships in existing or new markets. Vitas loss of existing relationships orits failure to develop new relationships could adversely affect its ability to expand or maintainits operations and operate profitably. Moreover, we cannot assure you that awareness or acceptanceof hospice care will increase or remain at current levels.Vitas operates in an industry that is subject to extensive government regulation and claimsreviews, and changes in law and regulatory interpretations could reduce its net patient servicerevenue and profitability and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.     The healthcare industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws, rules andregulations relating to, among others:  Payment for services;   Conduct of operations, including fraud and abuse, anti-kickback prohibitions,self-referral prohibitions and false claims;   Privacy and security of medical records;   Employment practices; and   Various state approval requirements, such as facility and professionallicensure, certificate of need, compliance surveys and other certification orrecertification requirements.     Changes in these laws, rules and regulations or in interpretations thereof could reduce Vitasnet patient service revenue and profitability. See the Government Regulations section of this10-K for a greater description of these matters.     Fraud and Abuse Laws. Vitas contracts with a significant number of health care providers andpractitioners, including physicians, hospitals and nursing homes and arranges for these entities toprovide services to Vitas patients. Some of these health care providers and practitioners mayrefer, or be in a position to refer, patients to Vitas (or Vitas may refer patients to them).These arrangements may not qualify for a safe harbor. Vitas from time to time seeks guidance fromregulatory counsel as to the changing and evolving interpretations and the potential applicabilityof the Anti-Kickback Law to its programs, and in response thereto, takes such actions as it deemsappropriate. Vitas generally believes that its contracts and arrangements with providers,practitioners and suppliers should not be found to violate the Anti-Kickback Law. However, wecannot assure you that such laws will ultimately be interpreted in a manner consistent with Vitaspractices.     Several health care reform proposals have included an expansion of the Anti-Kickback Law toinclude referrals of any patients regardless of payor source, which is similar to the scope ofcertain laws that have been enacted at the state level. In addition, a number of states in whichVitas operates have laws, which vary from state20Table of Contentsto state, prohibiting certain direct or indirect remuneration or fee-splitting arrangements betweenhealth care providers, regardless of payor source, for the referral of patients to a particularprovider.     The federal Ethics in Patient Referral Act, Section 1877 of the Social Security Act (commonlyknown as the Stark Law) prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients fordesignated health services to entities in which they hold an ownership or investment interest orwith whom they have a compensation arrangement, subject to certain statutory or regulatoryexceptions. We cannot assure you that future statutory or regulatory changes will not result inhospice services being subject to the Stark Laws ownership, investment, compensation or referralprohibitions. Several states in which Vitas operates have similar laws which likewise are subjectto change. Any such changes could adversely affect the business, financial condition and operatingresults of Vitas.     Further, under separate statutes, submission of claims for items or services that are notprovided as claimed may lead to civil money penalties, criminal fines and imprisonment and/orexclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federally funded state health careprograms. These false claims statutes include the federal False Claims Act, which allows anyperson to bring suit on behalf of the federal government, known as a qui tam action, alleging falseor fraudulent Medicare or Medicaid claims or other violations of the statute and to share in anyamounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. Any entity found to beviolating the False Claims Act may be liable for up to $11,000 per false claim and treble theamount of damages the federal government is found to have sustained because of the false claims.See the discussion of the governmental investigation pending against Vitas under Other HealthcareRegulations, above.     Certificate of Need Laws. Many states, including Florida, have certificate of need laws orother similar health planning laws that apply to hospice care providers. These states may requiresome form of state agency review or approval prior to opening a new hospice program, to adding orexpanding hospice services, to undertaking significant capital expenditures or under otherspecified circumstances. Approval under these certificate of need laws is generally conditioned onthe showing of a demonstrable need for services in the community. Vitas may seek to develop,acquire or expand hospice programs in states having certificate of need laws. To the extent thatstate agencies require Vitas to obtain a certificate of need or other similar approvals to expandservices at existing hospice programs or to make acquisitions or develop hospice programs in new orexisting geographical markets, Vitas plans could be adversely affected by a failure to obtain acertificate or approval. In addition, competitors may seek administratively or judicially tochallenge such an approval or proposed approval by the state agency. Such a challenge, whether ornot ultimately successful, could adversely affect Vitas.     Other Federal and State Regulations. The federal government and all states regulate variousaspects of the hospice industry and Vitas business. In particular, Vitas operations are subjectto federal and state health regulatory laws, including those covering professional services, thedispensing of drugs and certain types of hospice activities. Certain of Vitas employees aresubject to state laws and regulations governing professional practice. Vitas operations aresubject to periodic survey by governmental authorities and private accrediting entities to assurecompliance with applicable state licensing, and Medicare and Medicaid certification andaccreditation standards, as the case may be. From time to time in the ordinary course of business,Vitas receives survey reports noting deficiencies for alleged failure to comply with applicablerequirements. Vitas reviews such reports and takes appropriate corrective action. The failure toeffect such action could result in one of Vitas hospice programs being terminated from theMedicare hospice program. Any termination of one or more of Vitas hospice locations from theMedicare hospice program could adversely affect Vitas net patient service revenue andprofitability and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. The failureto obtain, renew or maintain any of the required regulatory approvals, certifications or licensescould materially adversely affect Vitas business and could prevent the programs involved fromoffering products and services to patients. In addition, laws and regulations often are adopted toregulate new products, services and industries. We cannot assure you that either the states or thefederal government will not impose additional regulations on Vitas activities, which mightmaterially adversely affect Vitas.21Table of Contents     Claims Review. The Medicare and Medicaid programs and their fiscal intermediaries and otherpayors periodically conduct pre-payment or post-payment reviews and other reviews and audits ofhealth care claims, including hospice claims. As a result of such reviews or audits, Vitas couldbe required to return any amounts found to be overpaid, or amounts found to be overpaid could berecouped through reductions in future payments. There is pressure from state and federalgovernments and other payors to scrutinize health care claims to determine their validity andappropriateness. During the past several years, Vitas claims have been subject to review andaudit. We cannot assure you that reviews and/or similar audits of Vitas claims will not result inmaterial recoupments, denials or other actions that could have a material adverse effect on Vitasbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. See the discussion of OIG investigationpending against Vitas under Other Health Care Regulations, above.     Regulation and Provision of Continuous Home Care. Vitas provides continuous home care topatients requiring such care. Continuous home care is provided to patients while at home, duringperiods of crisis when intensive monitoring and care, primarily nursing care, is required in orderto achieve palliation or management of acute medical symptoms. Continuous home care requires aminimum of 8 hours of care within a 24-hour day, which begins and ends at midnight. The care mustbe predominantly nursing care provided by either a registered nurse or licensed practical nurse.     Continuous home care can be challenging for a hospice to provide for a number of reasons,including the need to have available sufficient skilled and trained staff to furnish such care, theneed to manage the staffing and provision of such care, and a shortage of nurses that can make itparticularly difficult to attract and retain nurses that are required to furnish a majority of suchcare. Medicare reimbursement for continuous home care has been calculated by multiplying theapplicable continuous home care hourly rate by the number of hours of care provided. If the carewas provided for less than one hour, Medicare regulations allowed for rounding to the next hourincrement. Effective January 1, 2007, Medicare requires reporting in 15-minute increments of careprovided, with no rounding.     Medicare reimbursement for continuous home care is subject to a number of requirements posingfurther challenges for a hospice providing such care. For example, if a patient requires skilledinterventions for palliation or symptom management that can be accomplished in less than 8aggregate hours within the 24-hour period, if the majority of care can be accomplished by someoneother than a registered nurse or a licensed practical nurse (e.g., if a majority of care isfurnished by a home health aide or homemaker), or if for any reason less than 8 hours of directcare are provided (such as when a patient dies before 8 AM even if 7 or more hours of care has beenprovided), the care rendered cannot be reimbursed by Medicare at the continuous home care rate(although the care instead may be eligible for Medicare reimbursement at the reduced routine homecare day rate). As a result of such requirements, Vitas may incur the costs of providing servicesintended to be continuous home care services yet be unable to bill or be reimbursed for suchservices at the continuous home care rate. We cannot assure you that challenges in providingcontinuous home care will not cause Vitas net patient service revenue and profits to materiallydecline or that reviews and/or similar audits of Vitas claims will not result in materialrecoupments, denials or other actions that could have a material adverse effect on Vitas business,financial condition and results of operations.     Compliance. Vitas maintains an internal regulatory compliance review program and from time totime retains regulatory counsel for guidance on compliance matters. We cannot assure you, however,that Vitas practices, if reviewed, would be found to be in compliance with applicable healthregulatory laws, as such laws ultimately may be interpreted, or that any non-compliance with suchlaws would not have a material adverse effect on Vitas.Federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to patient privacy could requireVitas to expend substantial sums on acquiring, implementing and supporting new information systems,which could negatively impact its profitability.22Table of Contents     There are currently numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives at both the state andfederal levels that address patient privacy concerns. In particular, regulations issued under theHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) require Vitas to protect theprivacy and security of patients individual health information. We cannot predict the totalfinancial or other impact of the regulations on Vitas operations. In addition, although Vitasmanagement believes it is in compliance with the requirement of patient privacy regulations, wecannot assure you that Vitas will not be found to have violated state and federal laws, rules orguidelines surrounding patient privacy. Compliance with current and future HIPAA requirements orany other federal or state privacy initiatives could require Vitas to make substantial investments,which could negatively impact its profitability and cash flows.Vitas growth strategies may not be successful, which could adversely affect its business.     A significant element of Vitas growth strategy is expected to include expansion of itsbusiness in new and existing markets. This aspect of Vitas growth strategy may not be successful,which could adversely impact its growth and profitability. We cannot assure you that Vitas will beable to:  Identify markets that meet its selection criteria for new hospice locations;   Hire and retain qualified management teams to operate each of its new hospicelocations;   Manage a large and geographically diverse group of hospice locations;   Become Medicare and Medicaid certified in new markets;   Generate sufficient hospice admissions in new markets to operate profitably inthese new markets;   Compete effectively with existing hospices in new markets; or   Obtain state licensure and/or a certificate of need from appropriate stateagencies in new markets.     In addition to growing existing locations and developing new hospice locations, Vitas growthis expected to include expansion through acquisition of other hospices. We cannot assure you thatVitas acquisition strategy will be successful. The success of Vitas acquisition strategy dependsupon a number of factors, including:  Its ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates;   Its ability to negotiate favorable acquisition terms, including purchase price,which may be adversely affected due to increased competition with other buyers;   The availability of financing on favorable terms, or at all;   Its ability to integrate effectively the systems and operations of acquiredhospices;   Its ability to retain key personnel of acquired hospices; and   Its ability to obtain required regulatory approvals.     Acquisitions involve a number of other risks, including diversion of managements attentionfrom other business concerns and assuming known or unknown liabilities of acquired hospices,including liabilities for failure to comply with health care laws and regulations. Integratingacquired hospices may place significant strains on23Table of ContentsVitas current operating and financial systems and controls. Vitas may not successfully overcomethese risks or any other problems encountered in connection with its acquisition strategy.     In addition, since 1990, Vitas has acquired hospice programs, some of which involvedacquisitions of hospice programs from not-for-profit entities. Vitas believes that acquisitions ofnot-for-profit programs are generally more complex than acquisitions from for-profit entities andthat a substantial number of acquisition opportunities are likely to involve acquisitions fromnot-for-profit entities. Such acquisitions are subject to provisions of the Internal Revenue Codeand, in certain states, state attorney general powers, which have been interpreted to require thatthe consideration paid for the assets purchased be at fair market value and, where applicable, thatany fees paid for services be reasonable. In many states there is no mechanism for state attorneygeneral pre-clearance of transactions to assure that applicable standards have been met. Entitiesthat acquired not-for-profit hospices could face potential liability if the acquisition transactionis not structured to comply with Internal Revenue Code and state law requirements, and in somecases the transaction could be enjoined or subject to rescission. The acquisition ofnot-for-profit businesses, including the fairness of the purchase price paid, has receivedincreasing regulatory scrutiny by state attorneys general and other regulatory authorities.Although Vitas believes that reasonable actions have been taken to date to establish the fairmarket value of assets purchased in prior acquisitions of hospice operations from not-for-profitentities and the reasonableness of fees paid for services, we cannot assure you that suchtransactions or any future similar transactions will not be challenged or that, if challenged, theresults of such challenge would not have a material adverse effect on Vitas business.Vitas loss of key management personnel or its inability to hire and retain skilled employees couldadversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.     Vitas future success significantly depends upon the continued service of its seniormanagement personnel. The loss of one or more of Vitas key senior management personnel or itsinability to hire and retain new skilled employees could negatively impact Vitas ability tomaintain or increase patient referrals, a key aspect of its growth strategy, and could adverselyaffect its future operating results.     Competition for skilled employees is intense, and the process of locating and recruitingskilled employees with the combination of qualifications and attributes required to careeffectively for terminally ill patients and their families can be difficult and lengthy. We cannotassure you that Vitas will be successful in attracting, retaining or training highly skillednursing, management, community education, operations, admissions and other personnel. Vitasbusiness could be disrupted and its growth and profitability negatively impacted if it is unable toattract and retain skilled employees.A nationwide shortage of qualified nurses could adversely affect Vitas profitability, growth andability to continue to provide quality, responsive hospice services to its patients as nursingwages and benefits increase.     The substantial majority of Vitas workforce is nurses. Vitas depends on qualified nurses toprovide quality, responsive hospice services to its patients. The current nationwide shortage ofqualified nurses impacts some of the markets in which Vitas provides hospice services. In responseto this shortage, Vitas has adjusted its wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and toengage contract nurses. Vitas inability to attract and retain qualified nurses could adverselyaffect its ability to provide quality, responsive hospice services to its patients and its abilityto increase or maintain patient census in those markets. Increases in the wages and benefitsrequired to attract and retain qualified nurses or an increase in reliance on contract nurses couldnegatively impact profitability.Vitas may not be able to compete successfully against other hospice providers, and competitivepressures may limit its ability to maintain or increase its market position and adversely affectits profitability, financial condition and results of operations.     Hospice care in the United States is highly competitive. In many areas in which Vitashospices are located, they compete with a large number of organizations, including:24Table of Contents  Community-based hospice providers;   National and regional companies;   Hospital-based hospice and palliative care programs;   Physician groups;   Nursing homes;   Home health agencies;   Infusion therapy companies; and   Nursing agencies.     Various health care companies have diversified into the hospice market. Other companies,including hospitals and health care organizations that are not currently providing hospice care,may enter the markets Vitas serves and expand the variety of services offered to include hospicecare. We cannot assure you that Vitas will not encounter increased competition in the future thatcould limit its ability to maintain or increase its market position, including competition fromparties in a position to impact referrals to Vitas. Such increased competition could have amaterial adverse effect on Vitas business, financial condition and results of operations.Changes in rates or methods of payment for Vitas services could adversely affect its revenues andprofits.     Managed care organizations have grown substantially in terms of the percentage of thepopulation they cover and their control over an increasing portion of the health care economy.Managed care organizations have continued to consolidate to enhance their ability to influence thedelivery of health care services and to exert pressure to control health care costs. Vitas has anumber of contractual arrangements with managed care organizations and other similar parties.     Vitas provides hospice care to many Medicare beneficiaries who receive their non-hospicehealth care services from health maintenance organizations (HMOs) under Medicare risk contracts.Under such contracts between HMOs and the federal Department of Health and Human Services, theMedicare payments for hospice services are excluded from the per-member, per-month payment fromMedicare to HMOs and instead are paid directly by Medicare to the hospices. As a result, Vitaspayments for Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare risk HMOs are processed in the same waywith the same rates as other Medicare beneficiaries. We cannot assure, however, that paymentfor hospice services will continue to be excluded from HMO payment under Medicare risk contractsand similar Medicare managed care plans or that if not excluded, managed care organization or otherlarge third-party payors would not use their power to influence and exert pressure on health careproviders to reduce costs in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on Vitas business,financial condition and results of operations.Liability claims may have an adverse effect on Vitas, and its insurance coverage may be inadequate.     Participants in the hospice industry are subject to lawsuits alleging negligence, productliability or other similar legal theories, many of which involve large claims and significantdefense costs. From time to time, Vitas is subject to such and other types of lawsuits. See thedescription below under Legal Proceedings. The ultimate liability for claims, if any, could have amaterial adverse effect on its financial condition or operating results. Although Vitas currentlymaintains liability insurance intended to cover the claims, we cannot assure you that the coveragelimits of such insurance policies will be adequate or that all such claims will be covered by theinsurance. In addition, Vitas insurance policies must be renewed annually and may be subject tocancellation during the policy25Table of Contentsperiod. While Vitas has been able to obtain liability insurance in the past, such insurance variesin cost, is difficult to obtain and may not be available in the future on terms acceptable toVitas, if at all.     A successful claim in excess of the insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect onVitas. Claims, regardless of their merit or eventual outcome, also may have a material adverseeffect on Vitas business and reputation due to the costs of litigation, diversion of managementstime and related publicity.     Vitas procures professional liability coverage on a claims-made basis. The insurancecontracts specify that coverage is available only during the term of each insurance contract.Vitas management intends to renew or replace the existing claims-made policy annually but suchcoverage is difficult to obtain, may be subject to cancellation and may be written by carriers thatare unable, or unwilling to pay claims. During fiscal 2001, Vitas was notified that one of itsprior carriers was ordered into rehabilitation, and in early fiscal 2002, into liquidation,creating the possibility that certain prior year claims could be underinsured or uninsured.Certain claims have been asserted where the coverage would be the responsibility of this priorcarrier and/or other carriers that may not have the financial wherewithal to satisfy the claims.Additionally, some risks and liabilities, including claims for punitive damages, are not covered byinsurance"
16,CHE,CHEMED CORP,2007-02-28,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
     You should carefully consider the risks described below. They are not the only ones facingthe Company. Other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we deem to beimmaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or resultsof operations.GENERAL     We have incurred debt to finance the operations of the Company. We repaid $84.6 million ofthis in 2006. Our leverage may limit cash flow available for our operations, could adverselyaffect our ability to service our debt or obtain additional financing and could adversely affectour financial health and our ability to react to changes in our business.     The Company has debt service obligations that may restrict our operating flexibility. Wecannot assure you that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to service our debt, whichmay require us to borrow additional funds, or restructure or otherwise refinance our debt. Inaddition, the Company has the ability to expand its debt and borrowing capacity subject to variousrestrictions and covenants defined by its creditors. The interest rate the Company pays willfluctuate from time to time based15Table of Contentsupon a number of factors including current LIBOR rates andCompany operating performance. Significant changes in these factors could result in a materialchange in the Companys interest expense.     Our indebtedness could have important consequences for our business. Among other things, ourindebtedness may:  limit our ability to obtain additional financing;   limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the marketsin which we compete;   place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors with lessindebtedness;   increase our exposure to interest rate increases due to variable interest rateson certain borrowings;   limit our ability to complete future acquisitions;   limit our ability to make capital expenditures;   render us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and   require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to service andrepay our debt.Servicing our indebtedness will require a significant amount of cash, and our ability to generatecash depends on many factors beyond our control.     Our ability to repay or to refinance our indebtedness and to pay interest on our indebtednesswill depend on our operating performance, which may be affected by factors beyond our control.These factors could include operating difficulties, increased operating costs, our competitorsactions and regulatory developments. Our ability to meet our debt service and other obligationsmay depend in significant part on the extent to which we successfully implement our businessstrategy. We cannot assure you that we will be able to implement our strategy fully or that theanticipated results of our strategy will be realized.     If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations,we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek additional equitycapital or restructure our debt. We cannot assure you that our cash flows and capital resourceswill be sufficient to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness in thefuture or that alternative measures would successfully meet our debt service obligations.     As certain of our obligations under our credit facilities and certain other borrowings couldbear interest at floating rates, an increase in interest rates could further increase our debtservice costs and adversely affect our cash flows.The agreements and instruments governing our outstanding debt contain restrictions and limitationsthat could significantly impact our ability to operate our business and adversely affect the priceof our Capital Stock.     The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our instruments of indebtednessrestrict our ability to:  incur additional debt;   pay dividends, make redemptions and purchases of Capital Stock and make otherrestricted payments;16Table of Contents  issue and sell capital stock of subsidiaries;   sell assets;   engage in transactions with affiliates;   restrict distributions from subsidiaries;   incur liens;   engage in businesses other than permitted businesses;   engage in sale/leaseback transactions;   engage in mergers or consolidations;   make capital expenditures;   make guarantees;   make investments and acquisitions;   enter into operating leases;   hedge interest rates; and   prepay other debt.     Moreover, if we are unable to meet the terms of the financial covenants or if we breach any ofthese covenants, a default could result under one or more of these agreements. A default, if notwaived by our lenders, could accelerate repayment of our outstanding indebtedness. If accelerationoccurs, we may not be able to repay our debt and it is unlikely that we would be able to borrowsufficient additional funds to refinance such debt on acceptable terms. In the event of anydefault under our credit facilities, the lenders thereunder could elect to declare all outstandingborrowings, together with accrued and unpaid interest and other fees, to be due and payable, torequire us to apply all of our available cash to repay these borrowings, any of which would be anevent of default.We depend on our management team and the loss of their service could have a material adverse effecton our business, financial condition and results of operations.     Our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of our executive managementteam. The loss of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financialcondition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, we cannot assure you that we willbe able to attract or retain other skilled personnel in the future.Environmental compliance costs and liabilities could increase our expenses and adversely affect ourfinancial condition.     Our operations are subject to numerous environmental, health andsafety laws and regulations that prohibit or restrict the discharge of pollutants into theenvironment and regulate employee exposure to hazardous substances in the workplace. Failure tocomply with these laws could subject us to material costs and liabilities, including civil andcriminal fines, costs to cleanup contamination we cause and, in some circumstances, costs tocleanup contamination we discover on our own property but did not cause.     Because we use and generate hazardous materials in some of our operations, we are17Table of Contentspotentiallysubject to material liabilities relating to the cleanup of contamination and personal injuryclaims. In addition, we have retained certain environmental liabilities in connection with thesale of former businesses. We are currently funding the cleanup of historical contamination at oneof our former properties and contributing to the cleanup of third-party sites as a result of oursale of Dubois Chemicals Inc. Although we have established a reserve for these liabilities, actualcleanup costs may exceed our current estimates due to factors beyond our control, such as thediscovery of additional contamination or the enforcement of more stringent cleanup requirements.New laws and regulations or their stricter enforcement, the discovery of presently unknownconditions or the receipt of additional claims for indemnification could require us to incur costsor become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect onour business, financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to certain anti-takeover statues that might make it more difficult to effect achange in control of the Company.     We are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware GeneralCorporation Law, which prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with an interestedstockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the personbecame an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribedmanner. The application of Section 203 could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change ofcontrol that could be advantageous to stockholders.An adverse ruling against us in certain litigation could have an adverse effect on our financialcondition and results of operations.     We are involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of our business currently and fromtime to time. The damages claimed against us in some of these cases are substantial.     See the Legal Proceedings section of this 10-K for discussion of particular matters.     We cannot assure you that we will prevail in pending cases. Regardless of the outcome, suchlitigation is costly to manage, investigate and defend, and the related defense costs, diversion ofmanagements time and related publicity may adversely affect the conduct of our business and theresults of our operations.ROTO-ROOTERWe face intense competition from numerous, fragmented competitors. If we do not competeeffectively, our business may suffer.     We face intense competition from numerous competitors, many of whom have less leverage than wedo. The sewer, drain and pipe cleaning, and plumbing repair businesses are highly fragmented, withthe bulk of the industries consisting of local and regional competitors. We compete primarily onthe basis of advertising, range of services provided, name recognition, speed and quality ofcustomer service, service guarantees and pricing. Our competitors may succeed in developing new orenhanced products and services more successful than ours and in marketing and selling existing andnew products and services better than us. In addition, new competitors may emerge. We cannot makeany assurances that we will continue to be able to compete successfully with any of thesecompanies.Our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations, exposing us to potential claims andcompliance costs that could adversely affect our business.     We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to franchising,insurance and other aspects of our business. These are discussed in greater detail underGovernment Regulations in the Description of Business section hereof. If we fail to comply withexisting or future laws and regulations, we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines andsanctions. Our franchising activities are subject to various federal and state franchising lawsand regulations, including the18Table of Contentsrules and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission (the FTC)regarding the offering or sale of franchises. The rules and regulations of the FTC require us toprovide all of our prospective franchisees with specific information regarding us and our franchiseprogram in the form of a detailed franchise offering circular. In addition, a number of statesrequire us to register our franchise offering prior to offering or selling franchises in suchstates. Various state laws also provide for certain rights in favor of franchisees, including (i)limitations on the franchisors ability to terminate a franchise except for good cause, (ii)restrictions on the franchisors ability to deny renewal of a franchise, (iii) circumstances underwhich the franchisor may be required to purchase certain inventory of franchisees when a franchiseis terminated or not renewed in violation of such laws and (iv) provisions relating to arbitration.The ability to engage in the plumbing repair business is also subject to certain limitations andrestrictions imposed by state and local licensing laws and regulations. We cannot predict whatlegislation or regulations affecting our business will be enacted in the future, how existing orfuture laws or regulations will be enforced, administered and interpreted, or the amount of futureexpenditures that may be required to comply with these laws or regulations. Compliance costsassociated with governmental regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business,financial condition and results of operations.VITASVitas is highly dependent on payments from Medicare and Medicaid. Ifthere are changes in the rates or methods governing these payments, Vitas net patient servicerevenue and profits could materially decline.     In excess of 90% of Vitas net patient service revenue consists of payments from the Medicareand Medicaid programs. Such payments are made primarily on a per diem basis, subject to annualreimbursement caps. Because Vitas receives a per diem fee to provide eligible services to allpatients, Vitas profitability is largely dependent upon its ability to manage the costs ofproviding hospice services to patients. Increases in operating costs, such as labor and supplycosts that are subject to inflation, without a compensating increase in Medicare and Medicaidrates, could have a material adverse effect on Vitas business in the future. Medicare andMedicaid currently adjust the various hospice payment rates annually based on the increase ordecrease of the hospital wage index basket, regionally adjusted. However, the increases may beless than actual inflation. Vitas profitability could be negatively impacted if this adjustmentwere eliminated or reduced, or if Vitas costs of providing hospice services increased more thanthe annual adjustment. In addition, cost pressures resulting from shorter patient lengths of stayand the use of more expensive forms of palliative care, including drugs and drug delivery systems,could negatively impact Vitas profitability. Many payors are increasing pressure to controlhealth care costs. In addition, both public and private payors are increasing pressure to decrease,or limit increases in, reimbursement rates for health care services. Vitas levels of revenues andprofitability will be subject to the effect of possible reductions in coverage or payment rates bythird-party payors, including payment rates from Medicare and Medicaid.     Each state that maintains a Medicaid program has the option to provide reimbursement forhospice services at reimbursement rates generally required to be at least as much as Medicarerates. All states in which Vitas operates cover Medicaid hospice services; however, we cannotassure you that the states in which Vitas is presently operating or states into which Vitas couldexpand operations will continue to cover Medicaid hospice services. In addition, the Medicare andMedicaid programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive and prospective rateand payment adjustments, administrative rulings, freezes and funding reductions, all of which mayadversely affect the level of program payments and could have a material adverse effect on Vitasbusiness. We cannot assure you that Medicare and /or Medicaid payments to hospices will notdecrease. Reductions in amounts paid by government programs for services or changes in methods orregulations governing payments could cause Vitas net patient service revenue and profits tomaterially decline.Approximately one-third of Vitas hospice patients reside in nursing homes. Changes in the lawsand regulations regarding payments for hospice services and room and board19Table of Contentsprovided to Vitashospice patients residing in nursing homes could reduce its net patient service revenue andprofitability.     For Vitas hospice patients receiving nursing home care under certain state Medicaid programswho elect hospice care under Medicare and Medicaid, the state generally must pay Vitas, in additionto theapplicable Medicare or Medicaid hospice per diem rate, an amount equal to at least 95% of theMedicaid per diem nursing home rate for room and board furnished to the patient by the nursinghome. Vitas contracts with various nursing homes for the nursing homes provision of certain roomand board services that the nursing homes would otherwise provide Medicaid nursing home patients.Vitas bills and collects from the applicable state Medicaid program an amount equal toapproximately 95% of the amount that would otherwise have been paid directly to the nursing homeunder the states Medicaid plan. Under Vitas standard nursing home contracts, it pays the nursinghome for these room and board services at approximately 100% of the Medicaid per diem nursinghome rate.     The reduction or elimination of Medicare and Medicaid payments for hospice patients residingin nursing homes would reduce Vitas net patient service revenue and profitability. In addition,changes in the way nursing homes are reimbursed for room and board services provided to hospicepatients residing in nursing homes could effect Vitas ability to serve patients in nursing homes.If Vitas is unable to maintain relationships with existing patient referral sources or to establishnew referral sources, Vitas growth and profitability could be adversely affected.     Vitas success is heavily dependent on referrals from physicians, long-term care facilities,hospitals and other institutional health care providers, managed care companies, insurancecompanies and other patient referral sources in the communities that its hospice locations serve,as well as on its ability to maintain good relations with these referral sources. Vitas referralsources may refer their patients to other hospice care providers or not to a hospice provider atall. Vitas growth and profitability depend significantly on its ability to establish and maintainclose working relationships with these patient referral sources and to increase awareness andacceptance of hospice care by its referral sources and their patients. We cannot assure you thatVitas will be able to maintain its existing relationships or that it will be able to develop andmaintain new relationships in existing or new markets. Vitas loss of existing relationships orits failure to develop new relationships could adversely affect its ability to expand or maintainits operations and operate profitably. Moreover, we cannot assure you that awareness or acceptanceof hospice care will increase or remain at current levels.Vitas operates in an industry that is subject to extensive government regulation and claimsreviews, and changes in law and regulatory interpretations could reduce its net patient servicerevenue and profitability and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.     The health care industry is subject to extensive federal, state and local laws, rules andregulations relating to, among others:  payment for services;   conduct of operations, including fraud and abuse, anti-kickback prohibitions,self-referral prohibitions and false claims;   privacy and security of medical records;   employment practices; and   various state approval requirements, such as facility and professionallicensure, certificate of need, compliance surveys and other certification orrecertification requirements.20Table of Contents     Changes in these laws, rules and regulations or in interpretations thereof could reduce Vitasnet patient service revenue and profitability. See the Government Regulations section of this10-K for a greater description of these matters.     Fraud and Abuse Laws. Vitas contracts with a significant number of health care providers andpractitioners, including physicians, hospitals and nursing homes and arranges for these entities toprovide services to Vitas patients. Some of these health care providers and practitioners mayrefer, or be in a position to refer, patients to Vitas (or Vitas may refer patients to them).These arrangements may not qualify for a safe harbor. Vitas from time to time seeks guidance fromregulatory counsel as to the changing and evolving interpretations and the potential applicabilityof the Anti-Kickback Law to its programs, and in response thereto, takes such actions as it deemsappropriate. Vitas generally believes that its contracts and arrangements with providers,practitioners and suppliers should not be found to violate the Anti-Kickback Law. However, wecannot assure you that such laws will ultimately be interpreted in a manner consistent with Vitaspractices.     Several health care reform proposals have included an expansion of the Anti-Kickback Law toinclude referrals of any patients regardless of payor source, which is similar to the scope ofcertain laws that have been enacted at the state level. In addition, a number of states in whichVitas operates have laws, which vary from state to state, prohibiting certain direct or indirectremuneration or fee-splitting arrangements between health care providers, regardless of payorsource, for the referral of patients to a particular provider.     The federal Ethics in Patient Referral Act, Section 1877 of the Social Security Act (commonlyknow an the Stark Law) prohibits physicians from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients fordesignated health services to entities in which they hold an ownership or investment interest orwith whom they have a compensation arrangement, subject to certain statutory or regulatoryexceptions. We cannot assure you that future statutory or regulatory changes will not result inhospice services being subject to the Stark Laws ownership, investment, compensation or referralprohibitions. Several states in which Vitas operates have similar laws which likewise are subjectto change. Any such changes could adversely affect the business, financial conditionand operating results of Vitas.     Further, under separate statutes, submission of claims for items or services that are notprovided as claimed may lead to civil money penalties, criminal fines and imprisonment and/orexclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federally funded state health careprograms. These false claims statutes include the federal False Claims Act, which allows anyperson to bring suit on behalf of the federal government, known as a qui tam action, alleging falseor fraudulent Medicare or Medicaid claims or other violations of the statute and to share in anyamounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. Any entity found to beviolating the False Claims Act may be liable for up to $11,000 per false claim and treble theamount of damages the federal government is found to have sustained because of the false claims.See the discussion of the qui tam case pending against Vitas under Other Healthcare Regulations,above.     Certificate of Need Laws. Many states, including Florida, have certificate of need laws orother similar health planning laws that apply to hospice care providers. These states may requiresome form of state agency review or approval prior to opening a new hospice program, to adding orexpanding hospice services, to undertaking significant capital expenditures or under otherspecified circumstances. Approval under these certificate of need laws is generally conditioned onthe showing of a demonstrable need for services in the community. Vitas may seek to develop,acquire or expand hospice programs in states having certificate of need laws. To the extent thatstate agencies require Vitas to obtain a certificate of need or other similar approvals to expandservices at existing hospice programs or to make acquisitions or develop hospice programs in new orexisting geographical markets, Vitas plans could be adversely affected by a failure to obtain acertificate or approval. In addition, competitors may seek administratively or judicially tochallenge such an approval or proposed approval by the state agency. Such a challenge, whether ornot ultimately successful, could adversely affect Vitas.21Table of Contents     Other Federal and State Regulations. The federal government and all states regulate variousaspects of the hospice industry and Vitas business. In particular, Vitas operations are subjectto federal and state health regulatory laws, including those covering professional services, thedispensing of drugs and certain types of hospice activities. Certain of Vitas employees aresubject to state laws and regulations governing professional practice. Vitas operations aresubject to periodic survey by governmental authorities and private accrediting entities to assurecompliance with applicable state licensing, and Medicare and Medicaid certification andaccreditation standards, as the case may be. From time to time in the ordinary course of business,Vitas receives survey reports noting deficiencies for alleged failure to comply with applicablerequirements. Vitas reviews such reports and takes appropriate corrective action. The failure toeffect such action could result in one of Vitas hospice programs being terminated from theMedicare hospice program. Any termination of one or more of Vitas hospice locations from theMedicare hospice program could adversely affect Vitas net patient service revenue andprofitability and adversely affect its financial condition and results of operations.The failure to obtain, renew or maintain any of the required regulatory approvals,certifications or licenses could materially adversely affect Vitas business and could prevent theprograms involved from offering products and services to patients. In addition, laws andregulations often are adopted to regulate new products, services and industries. We cannot assureyou that either the states or the federal government will not impose additional regulations onVitas activities, which might materially adversely affect Vitas.     Claims Review. The Medicare and Medicaid programs and their fiscal intermediaries and otherpayors periodically conduct pre-payment or post-payment reviews and other reviews and audits ofhealth care claims, including hospice claims. As a result of such reviews or audits, Vitas couldbe required to return any amounts found to be overpaid, or amounts found to be overpaid could berecouped through reductions in future payments. There is pressure from state and federalgovernments and other payors to scrutinize health care claims to determine their validity andappropriateness. During the past several years, Vitas claims have been subject to review andaudit. We cannot assure you that reviews and/or similar audits of Vitas claims will not result inmaterial recoupments, denials or other actions that could have a material adverse effect on Vitasbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. See the discussion of OIG investigationpending against Vitas under Other Health Care Regulations, above.     Regulation and Provision of Continuous Home Care. Vitas provides continuous home care topatients requiring such care. Continuous home care is provided to patients while at home, duringperiods of crisis when intensive monitoring and care, primarily nursing care, is required in orderto achieve palliation or management of acute medical symptoms. Continuous home care requires aminimum of 8 hours of care within a 24-hour day, which begins and ends at midnight. The care mustbe predominantly nursing care provided by either a registered nurse or licensed practical nurse.     Continuous home care can be challenging for a hospice to provide for a number of reasons,including the need to have available sufficient skilled and trained staff to furnish such care, theneed to manage the staffing and provision of such care, and a shortage of nurses that can make itparticularly difficult to attract and retain nurses that are required to furnish a majority of suchcare. Medicare reimbursement for continuous home care has been calculated by multiplying theapplicable continuous home care hourly rate by the number of hours of care provided. If the carewas provided for less than one hour, Medicare regulations allowed for rounding to the next hourincrement. Effective January 1, 2007, Medicare requires reporting in 15 minute increments of careprovided, with no rounding.     Medicare reimbursement for continuous home care is subject to a number of requirements posingfurther challenges for a hospice providing such care. For example, if a patient requires skilledinterventions for palliation or symptom management that can be accomplished in less than 8aggregate hours within the 24-hour period, if the majority of care can be accomplished by someoneother than a registered nurse or a licensed practical nurse (e.g., if a majority of care isfurnished by a homehealth aide or homemaker), or if for any reason less than 8 hours of direct care are provided(such as when a patient dies before 8 AM even if 7 or more hours of care has been provided),22Table of Contentsthecare rendered cannot be reimbursed by Medicare at the continuous home care rate (although the careinstead may be eligible for Medicare reimbursement at the reduced routine home care day rate). Asa result of such requirements, Vitas may incur the costs of providing services intended to becontinuous home care services yet be unable to bill or be reimbursed for such services at thecontinuous home care rate. We cannot assure you that challenges in providing continuous home carewill not cause Vitas net patient service revenue and profits to materially decline or that reviewsand/or similar audits of Vitas claims will not result in material recoupments, denials or otheractions that could have a material adverse effect on Vitas business, financial condition andresults of operations.     Compliance. Vitas maintains an internal regulatory compliance review program and from time totime retains regulatory counsel for guidance on compliance matters. We cannot assure you, however,that Vitas practices, if reviewed, would be found to be in compliance with applicable healthregulatory laws, as such laws ultimately may be interpreted, or that any non-compliance with suchlaws would not have a material adverse effect on Vitas.Federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to patient privacy could requireVitas to expend substantial sums on acquiring, implementing and supporting new information systems,which could negatively impact its profitability.     There are currently numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives at both the state andfederal levels that address patient privacy concerns. In particular, regulations issued under theHealth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) require Vitas to protect theprivacy and security of patients individual health information. We cannot predict the totalfinancial or other impact of the regulations on Vitas operations. In addition, although Vitas management believes it is in compliance with the requirement of patient privacy regulations, wecannot assure you that Vitas will not be found to have violated state and federal laws, rules orguidelines surrounding patient privacy. Compliance with current and future HIPAA requirements orany other federal or state privacy initiatives could require Vitas to make substantial investments,which could negatively impact its profitability and cash flows.Vitas growth strategies may not be successful, which could adversely affect its business.     A significant element of Vitas growth strategy is expected to include expansion of itsbusiness in new and existing markets. This aspect of Vitas growth strategy may not be successful,which could adversely impact its growth and profitability. We cannot assure you that Vitas will beable to:  identify markets that meet its selection criteria for new hospice locations;   hire and retain qualified management teams to operate each of its new hospicelocations;   manage a large and geographically diverse group of hospice locations;   become Medicare and Medicaid certified in new markets;   generate sufficient hospice admissions in new markets to operate profitably inthese new markets;   compete effectively with existing hospices in new markets; or   obtain state licensure and/or a certificate of need from appropriate stateagencies in new markets.     In addition to growing existing locations and developing new hospice locations, Vitas growthstrategy is expected to include expansion through acquisition of other23Table of Contentshospices. We cannot assureyou that Vitas acquisition strategy will be successful. The success of Vitas acquisitionstrategy depends upon a number of factors, including:  its ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates;   its ability to negotiate favorable acquisition terms, including purchaseprice, which may be adversely affected due to increased competition with otherbuyers;   the availability of financing on favorable terms, or at all;   its ability to integrate effectively the systems and operations of acquiredhospices;   its ability to retain key personnel of acquired hospices; and   its ability to obtain required regulatory approvals.     Acquisitions involve a number of other risks, including diversion of managements attentionfrom other business concerns and assuming known or unknown liabilities of acquired hospices,including liabilities for failure to comply with health care laws and regulations. Integratingacquired hospices may place significant strains on Vitas current operating and financial systemsand controls. Vitas may not successfully overcome these risks or any other problems encountered inconnection with its acquisition strategy.     In addition, since 1990, Vitas has acquired hospice programs, some of which involvedacquisitions of hospice programs from not-for-profit entities. Vitas believes that acquisitions ofnot-for-profit programs are generally more complex than acquisitions from for-profit entitiesand that a substantial number of acquisition opportunities are likely to involve acquisitionsfrom not-for-profit entities. Such acquisitions are subject to provisions of the Internal RevenueCode and, in certain states, state attorney general powers, which have been interpreted to requirethat the consideration paid for the assets purchased be at fair market value and, where applicable,that any fees paid for services be reasonable. In many states there is no mechanism for stateattorney general pre-clearance of transactions to assure that applicable standards have been met.Entities that acquire not-for-profit hospices could face potential liability if the acquisitiontransaction is not structured to comply with Internal Revenue Code and state law requirements, andin some cases the transaction could be enjoined or subject to rescission. The acquisition ofnot-for-profit businesses, including the fairness of the purchase price paid, has receivedincreasing regulatory scrutiny by state attorneys general and other regulatory authorities.Although Vitas believes that reasonable actions have been taken to date to establish the fairmarket value of assets purchased in prior acquisitions of hospice operations from not-for-profitentities and the reasonableness of fees paid for services, we cannot assure you that suchtransactions or any future similar transactions will not be challenged or that, if challenged, theresults of such challenge would not have a material adverse effect on Vitas business.Vitas loss of key management personnel or its inability to hire and retain skilled employees couldadversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.     Vitas future success significantly depends upon the continued service of its seniormanagement personnel. The loss of one or more of Vitas key senior management personnel or itsinability to hire and retain new skilled employees could negatively impact Vitas ability tomaintain or increase patient referrals, a key aspect of its growth strategy, and could adverselyaffect its future operating results.     Competition for skilled employees is intense, and the process of locating and recruitingskilled employees with the combination of qualifications and attributes required to careeffectively for terminally ill patients and their families can be difficult and lengthy. We cannotassure you that Vitas will be successful in24Table of Contentsattracting, retaining or training highly skillednursing, management, community education, operations, admissions and other personnel. Vitasbusiness could be disrupted and its growth and profitability negatively impacted if it is unable toattract and retain skilled employees.A nationwide shortage of qualified nurses could adversely affect Vitas profitability, growth andability to continue to provide quality, responsive hospice services to its patients as nursingwages and benefits increase.     The substantial majority of Vitas workforce is nurses. Vitas depends on qualified nurses toprovide quality, responsive hospice services to its patients. The current nationwide shortage ofqualified nurses impacts some of the markets in which Vitas provides hospice services. In responseto this shortage, Vitas has adjusted its wagesand benefits to recruit and retain nurses and to engage contract nurses. Vitas inability toattract and retain qualified nurses could adversely affect its ability to provide quality,responsive hospice services to its patients and its ability to increase or maintain patient censusin those markets. Increases in the wages and benefits required to attract and retain qualifiednurses or an increase in reliance on contract nurses could negatively impact profitability.Vitas may not be able to compete successfully against other hospice providers, and competitivepressures may limit its ability to maintain or increase its market position and adversely affectits profitability, financial condition and results of operations.     Hospice care in the United States is highly competitive. In many areas in which Vitashospices are located, they compete with a large number of organizations, including:  community-based hospice providers;   national and regional companies;   hospital-based hospice and palliative care programs;   physician groups;   nursing homes;   home health agencies;   infusion therapy companies; and   nursing agencies     Various health care companies have diversified into the hospice market. Other companies,including hospitals and health care organizations that are not currently providing hospice care,may enter the markets Vitas serves and expand the variety of services offered to include hospicecare. We cannot assure you that Vitas will not encounter increased competition in the future thatcould limit its ability to maintain or increase its market position, including competition fromparties in a position to impact referrals to Vitas. Such increased competition could have amaterial adverse effect on Vitas business, financial condition and results of operations.Changes in rates or methods of payment for Vitas services could adversely affect its revenues andprofits.     Managed care organizations have grown substantially in terms of the percentage of thepopulation they cover and their control over an increasing portion of the health care economy.Managed care organizations have continued to consolidate to enhance their ability to influence thedelivery of health care services and to exert pressure to control health care costs. Vitas has anumber of contractualarrangements with managed care organizations and other similar parties.25Table of Contents     Vitas provides hospice care to many Medicare beneficiaries who receive their non-hospicehealth care services from health maintenance organizations (HMOs) under Medicare risk contracts.Under such contracts between HMOs and the federal Department of Health and Human Services, theMedicare payments for hospice services are excluded from the per-member, per-month payment fromMedicare to HMOs and instead are paid directly by Medicare to the hospices. As a result, Vitaspayments for Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare risk HMOs are processed in the same waywith the same rates as other Medicare beneficiaries. We cannot assure, however, that payment forhospice services will continue to be excluded from HMO payment under Medicare risk contracts andsimilar Medicare managed care plans or that if not excluded, managed care organizations or otherlarge third-party payors would not use their power to influence and exert pressure on health careproviders to reduce costs in a manner that could have a material adverse effect on Vitas business,financial condition and results of operations.Liability claims may have an adverse effect on Vitas, and its insurance coverage may be inadequate.     Participants in the hospice industry are subject to lawsuits alleging negligence, productliability or other similar legal theories, many of which involve large claims and significantdefense costs. From time to time, Vitas is subject to such and other types of lawsuits. See thedescription below under Legal Proceedings. The ultimate liability for claims, if any, could have amaterial adverse effect on its financial condition or operating results. Although Vitas currentlymaintains liability insurance intended to cover the claims, we cannot assure you that the coveragelimits of such insurance policies will be adequate or that all such claims will be covered by theinsurance. In addition, Vitas insurance policies must be renewed annually and may be subject tocancellation during the policy period. While Vitas has been able to obtain liability insurance inthe past, such insurance varies in cost, is difficult to obtain and may not be available in thefuture on terms acceptable to Vitas, if at all.     A successful claim in excess of the insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect onVitas. Claims, regardless of their merit or eventual outcome, also may have a material adverseeffect on Vitas business and reputation due to the costs of litigation, diversion of managementstime and related publicity.     Vitas procures professional liability coverage on a claims-made basis. The insurancecontracts specify that coverage is available only during the term of each insurance contract.Vitas management intends to renew or replace the existing claims-made policy annually but suchcoverage is difficult to obtain, may be subject to cancellation and may be written by carriers thatare unable, or unwilling to pay claims. During fiscal 2001, Vitas was notified that one of itsprior carriers was ordered into rehabilitation, and in early fiscal 2002, into liquidation,creating the possibility that certain prior year claims could be underinsured or uninsured.Certain claims have been asserted where the coverage would be the responsibility of this priorcarrierand/or other carriers that may not have the financial wherewithal to satisfy the claims.Additionally, some risks and liabilities, including claims for punitive damages, are not covered byinsurance"
0,CHE,CHEMED CORP,2006-03-16,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS     You should carefully consider the risks described below. They are not theonly ones facing the Company. Other risks and uncertainties not currently knownto us or that we deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affectour business, financial condition, or results of operations.GENERAL     WE HAVE INCURRED DEBT TO FINANCE THE OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY. OURLEVERAGE WILL LIMIT CASH FLOW AVAILABLE FOR OUR OPERATIONS, COULD ADVERSELYAFFECT OUR ABILITY TO SERVICE OUR DEBT OR OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING AND COULDADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL HEALTH AND OUR ABILITY TO REACT TO CHANGES IN OURBUSINESS.     The Company has debt service obligations that may restrict our operatingflexibility. We cannot assure you that our cash flow from operations will besufficient to service our debt, which may require us to borrow additional funds,or restructure or otherwise refinance our debt. In addition, the Company has theability to expand its debt and borrowing capacity subject to variousrestrictions and covenants defined by its                                       15creditors. The interest rate the Company pays will fluctuate from time to timebased upon a number of factors including current LIBOR rates and Companyoperating performance. Significant changes in these factors could result in amaterial change in the Company's interest expense.     Our indebtedness could have important consequences for our business. Amongother things, our indebtedness may:          -    limit our ability to obtain additional financing;          -    limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in               the markets in which we compete;          -    place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our               competitors with less indebtedness;          -    increase our exposure to interest rate increases due to variable               interest rates on certain borrowings;          -    limit our ability to complete future acquisitions;          -    limit our ability to make capital expenditures;          -    render us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and               industry conditions; and          -    require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to               service and repay our debt.Servicing our indebtedness will require a significant amount of cash, and ourability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.     Our ability to repay or to refinance our indebtedness and to pay intereston our indebtedness will depend on our operating performance, which may beaffected by factors beyond our control. These factors could include operatingdifficulties, increased operating costs, our competitors' actions and regulatorydevelopments. Our ability to meet our debt service and other obligations maydepend in significant part on the extent to which we successfully implement ourbusiness strategy. We cannot assure you that we will be able to implement ourstrategy fully or that the anticipated results of our strategy will be realized.     If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debtservice obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures,sell assets, seek additional equity capital or restructure our debt. We cannotassure you that our cash flows and capital resources will be sufficient to makescheduled payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness in the futureor that alternative measures would successfully meet our debt serviceobligations.     As certain of our obligations under our credit facilities and certain otherborrowings bear interest at floating rates, an increase in interest rates couldfurther increase our debt service costs and adversely affect our cash flows.THE AGREEMENTS AND INSTRUMENTS GOVERNING OUR OUTSTANDING DEBT CONTAINRESTRICTIONS AND LIMITATIONS THAT COULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT OUR ABILITY TOOPERATE OUR BUSINESS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PRICE OF OUR CAPITAL STOCK.     The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our instrumentsof indebtedness restrict our ability to:          -    incur additional debt;                                       16          -    pay dividends, make redemptions and purchases of Capital Stock               and make other restricted payments;          -    issue and sell capital stock of subsidiaries;          -    sell assets;          -    engage in transactions with affiliates;          -    restrict distributions from subsidiaries;          -    incur liens;          -    engage in businesses other than permitted businesses;          -    engage in sale/leaseback transactions;          -    engage in mergers or consolidations;          -    make capital expenditures;          -    make guarantees;          -    make investments and acquisitions;          -    enter into operating leases;          -    hedge interest rates; and          -    prepay other debt.     Moreover, if we are unable to meet the terms of the financial covenants orif we breach any of these covenants, a default could result under one or more ofthese agreements. A default, if not waived by our lenders, could acceleraterepayment of our outstanding indebtedness. If acceleration occurs, we may not beable to repay our debt and it is unlikely that we would be able to borrowsufficient additional funds to refinance such debt on acceptable terms. In theevent of any default under our credit facilities, the lenders thereunder couldelect to declare all outstanding borrowings, together with accrued and unpaidinterest and other fees, to be due and payable, to require us to apply all ofour available cash to repay these borrowings, any of which would be an event ofdefault.WE DEPEND ON OUR MANAGEMENT TEAM AND THE LOSS OF THEIR SERVICE COULD HAVE AMATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OFOPERATIONS.     Our success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of ourexecutive management team. The loss of key personnel could have a materialadverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations andcash flows. Additionally, we cannot assure you that we will be able to attractor retain other skilled personnel in the future.ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE COSTS AND LIABILITIES COULD INCREASE OUR EXPENSES ANDADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION.     Our operations are subject to numerous environmental, health and safetylaws and regulations that prohibit or restrict the discharge of pollutants intothe environment and regulate employee exposure to hazardous substances in theworkplace. Failure to comply with these laws could subject us to material costsand liabilities, including civil and criminal fines, costs to cleanupcontamination we cause and, in some circumstances, costs to cleanupcontamination we discover on our own property but did not cause.                                       17     Because we use and generate hazardous materials in some of our operations,we are potentially subject to material liabilities relating to the cleanup ofcontamination and personal injury claims. In addition, we have retained certainenvironmental liabilities in connection with the sale of former businesses. Weare currently funding the cleanup of historical contamination at one of ourformer properties and contributing to the cleanup of third-party sites as aresult of our sale of Dubois Chemicals Inc. Although we have established areserve for these liabilities, actual cleanup costs may exceed our currentestimates due to factors beyond our control, such as the discovery of additionalcontamination or the enforcement of more stringent cleanup requirements. Newlaws and regulations or their stricter enforcement, the discovery of presentlyunknown conditions or the receipt of additional claims for indemnification couldrequire us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilitiesthat could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditionand results of operations.WE ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN ANTI-TAKEOVER STATUES THAT MIGHT MAKE IT MOREDIFFICULT TO EFFECT A CHANGE IN CONTROL OF THE COMPANY.     We are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Section 203 of theDelaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits us from engaging in a""business combination"" with an ""interested stockholder"" for a period of threeyears after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interestedstockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.The application of Section 203 could have the effect of delaying or preventing achange of control that could be advantageous to stockholders.AN ADVERSE RULING AGAINST US IN CERTAIN LITIGATION COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECTON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.     We are involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of our businesscurrently and from time to time. The damages claimed against us in some of thesecases are substantial.     See the ""Legal Proceedings"" section of this 10-K for discussion ofparticular matters.     We cannot assure you that we will prevail in pending cases. Regardless ofthe outcome, such litigation is costly to manage, investigate and defend, andthe related defense costs, diversion of management's time and related publicitymay adversely affect the conduct of our business and the results of ouroperations.ROTO-ROOTERWE FACE INTENSE COMPETITION FROM NUMEROUS, FRAGMENTED COMPETITORS. IF WE DO NOTCOMPETE EFFECTIVELY, OUR BUSINESS MAY SUFFER.     We face intense competition from numerous competitors, many of whom haveless leverage than we do. The sewer, drain and pipe cleaning, and plumbingrepair businesses are highly fragmented, with the bulk of the industriesconsisting of local and regional competitors. We compete primarily on the basisof advertising, range of services provided, name recognition, speed and qualityof customer service, service guarantees and pricing. Our competitors may succeedin developing new or enhanced products and services more successful than oursand in marketing and selling existing and new products and services better thanus. In addition, new competitors may emerge. We cannot make any assurances thatwe will continue to be able to compete successfully with any of these companies.OUR OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS LAWS AND REGULATIONS, EXPOSING US TOPOTENTIAL CLAIMS AND COMPLIANCE COSTS THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.     We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating tofranchising, insurance and other aspects of our business. These are discussed ingreater detail under ""Government Regulations"" in the Description of Businesssection hereof. If we fail to comply with existing or future laws andregulations, we may be                                       18subject to governmental or judicial fines and sanctions. Our franchisingactivities are subject to various federal and state franchising laws andregulations, including the rules and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission(the ""FTC"") regarding the offering or sale of franchises. The rules andregulations of the FTC require us to provide all of our prospective franchiseeswith specific information regarding us and our franchise program in the form ofa detailed franchise offering circular. In addition, a number of states requireus to register our franchise offering prior to offering or selling franchises insuch states. Various state laws also provide for certain rights in favor offranchisees, including (i) limitations on the franchisor's ability to terminatea franchise except for good cause, (ii) restrictions on the franchisor's abilityto deny renewal of a franchise; (iii) circumstances under which the franchisormay be required to purchase certain inventory of franchisees when a franchise isterminated or not renewed in violation of such laws and (iv) provisions relatingto arbitration. The ability to engage in the plumbing repair business is alsosubject to certain limitations and restrictions imposed by state and locallicensing laws and regulations. We cannot predict what legislation orregulations affecting our business will be enacted in the future, how existingor future laws or regulations will be enforced, administered and interpreted, orthe amount of future expenditures that may be required to comply with these lawsor regulations. Compliance costs associated with governmental regulations couldhave material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results ofoperations.VITASVITAS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON PAYMENTS FROM MEDICARE AND MEDICAID. IF THERE ARECHANGES IN THE RATES OR METHODS GOVERNING THESE PAYMENTS, VITAS' NET PATIENTSERVICE REVENUE AND PROFITS COULD MATERIALLY DECLINE.     Approximately 95% of Vitas' net patient service revenue consists ofpayments from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Such payments are madeprimarily on a ""per diem"" basis, subject to annual reimbursement caps. BecauseVitas receives a per diem fee to provide eligible services to all patients,Vitas' profitability is largely dependent upon its ability to manage the costsof providing hospice services to patients. Increases in operating costs, such aslabor and supply costs that are subject to inflation, without a compensatingincrease in Medicare and Medicaid rates, could have a material adverse effect onVitas' business in the future. Medicare and Medicaid currently adjust thevarious hospice payment rates annually based on the increase or decrease of thehospital wage index basket, regionally adjusted. However, the increases may beless than actual inflation. Vitas' profitability could be negatively impacted ifthis adjustment were eliminated or reduced, or if Vitas' costs of providinghospice services increased more than the annual adjustment. In addition, costpressures resulting from shorter patient lengths of stay and the use of moreexpensive forms of palliative care, including drugs and drug delivery systems,could negatively impact Vitas' profitability. Many payors are increasingpressure to control health care costs. In addition, both public and privatepayors are increasing pressure to decrease, or limit increases in, reimbursementrates for health care services. Vitas' levels of revenues and profitability willbe subject to the effect of possible reductions in coverage or payment rates bythird-party payors, including payment rates from Medicare and Medicaid.     Each state that maintains a Medicaid program has the option to providereimbursement for hospice services at reimbursement rates generally required tobe at least as much as Medicare rates. All states in which Vitas operates coverMedicaid hospice services; however, we cannot assure you that the states inwhich Vitas is presently operating or states into which Vitas could expandoperations will continue to cover Medicaid hospice services. In addition, theMedicare and Medicaid programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes,retroactive and prospective rate and payment adjustments, administrativerulings, freezes and funding reductions, all of which may adversely affect thelevel of program payments and could have a material adverse effect on Vitas'business. We cannot assure you that Medicare and /or Medicaid payments tohospices will not decrease. Reductions in amounts paid by government programsfor services or changes in methods or regulations governing payments could causeVitas' net patient service revenue and profits to materially decline.                                       19APPROXIMATELY ONE-THIRD OF VITAS' HOSPICE PATIENTS RESIDE IN NURSING HOMES.CHANGES IN THE LAWS AND REGULATIONS REGARDING PAYMENTS FOR HOSPICE SERVICES AND""ROOM AND BOARD"" PROVIDED TO VITAS' HOSPICE PATIENTS RESIDING IN NURSING HOMESCOULD REDUCE ITS NET PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY.     For Vitas' hospice patients receiving nursing home care under certain stateMedicaid programs who elect hospice care under Medicare and Medicaid, the stategenerally must pay Vitas, in addition to the applicable Medicare or Medicaidhospice per diem rate, an amount equal to at least 95% of the Medicaid per diemnursing home rate for ""room and board"" furnished to the patient by the nursinghome. Vitas contracts with various nursing homes for the nursing homes'provision of certain ""room and board"" services that the nursing homes wouldotherwise provide Medicaid nursing home patients. Vitas bills and collects fromthe applicable state Medicaid program an amount equal to approximately 95% ofthe amount that would otherwise have been paid directly to the nursing homeunder the state's Medicaid plan. Under Vitas' standard nursing home contracts,it pays the nursing home for these ""room and board"" services at approximately100% of the Medicaid per diem nursing home rate.     The reduction or elimination of Medicare and Medicaid payments for hospicepatients residing in nursing homes would reduce Vitas' net patient servicerevenue and profitability. In addition, changes in the way nursing homes arereimbursed for ""room and board"" services provided to hospice patients residingin nursing homes could effect Vitas' ability to serve patients in nursing homes.IF VITAS IS UNABLE TO MAINTAIN RELATIONSHIPS WITH EXISTING PATIENT REFERRALSOURCES OR TO ESTABLISH NEW REFERRAL SOURCES, VITAS' GROWTH AND PROFITABILITYCOULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.     Vitas' success is heavily dependent on referrals from physicians, long-termcare facilities, hospitals and other institutional health care providers,managed care companies, insurance companies and other patient referral sourcesin the communities that its hospice locations serve, as well as on its abilityto maintain good relations with these referral sources. Vitas' referral sourcesmay refer their patients to other hospice care providers or not to a hospiceprovider at all. Vitas' growth and profitability depend significantly on itsability to establish and maintain close working relationships with these patientreferral sources and to increase awareness and acceptance of hospice care by itsreferral sources and their patients. We cannot assure you that Vitas will beable to maintain its existing relationships or that it will be able to developand maintain new relationships in existing or new markets. Vitas' loss ofexisting relationships or its failure to develop new relationships couldadversely affect its ability to expand or maintain its operations and operateprofitably. Moreover, we cannot assure you that awareness or acceptance ofhospice care will increase or remain at current levels.VITAS OPERATES IN AN INDUSTRY THAT IS SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE GOVERNMENT REGULATIONAND CLAIMS REVIEWS, AND CHANGES IN LAW AND REGULATORY INTERPRETATIONS COULDREDUCE ITS NET PATIENT SERVICE REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY AND ADVERSELY AFFECTITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.     The health care industry is subject to extensive federal, state and locallaws, rules and regulations relating to, among others:          -    payment for services;          -    conduct of operations, including fraud and abuse, anti-kickback               prohibitions, self-referral prohibitions and false claims;          -    privacy and security of medical records;          -    employment practices; and                                       20          -    various state approval requirements, such as facility and               professional licensure, certificate of need, compliance surveys               and other certification or recertification requirements.     Changes in these laws, rules and regulations or in interpretations thereofcould reduce Vitas' net patient service revenue and profitability. See the""Government Regulations"" section of this 10-K for a greater description of thesematters.     Fraud and Abuse Laws. Vitas contracts with a significant number of healthcare providers and practitioners, including physicians, hospitals and nursinghomes and arranges for these entities to provide services to Vitas' patients.Some of these health care providers and practitioners may refer, or be in aposition to refer, patients to Vitas (or Vitas may refer patients to them).These arrangements may not qualify for a safe harbor. Vitas from time to timeseeks guidance from regulatory counsel as to the changing and evolvinginterpretations and the potential applicability of the Anti-Kickback Law to itsprograms, and in response thereto, takes such actions as it deems appropriate.Vitas generally believes that its contracts and arrangements with providers,practitioners and suppliers should not be found to violate the Anti-KickbackLaw. However, we cannot assure you that such laws will ultimately be interpretedin a manner consistent with Vitas' practices.     Several health care reform proposals have included an expansion of theAnti-Kickback Law to include referrals of any patients regardless of payorsource, which is similar to the scope of certain laws that have been enacted atthe state level. In addition, a number of states in which Vitas operates havelaws, which vary from state to state, prohibiting certain direct or indirectremuneration or fee-splitting arrangements between health care providers,regardless of payor source, for the referral of patients to a particularprovider.     The federal Ethics in Patient Referral Act, Section 1877 of the SocialSecurity Act (commonly know an the ""Stark Law"") prohibits physicians fromreferring Medicare or Medicaid patients for ""designated health services"" toentities in which they hold an ownership or investment interest or with whomthey have a compensation arrangement, subject to certain statutory or regulatoryexceptions. We cannot assure you that future statutory or regulatory changeswill not result in hospice services being subject to the Stark Law's ownership,investment, compensation or referral prohibitions. Several states in which Vitasoperates have similar laws which likewise are subject to change. Any suchchanges could adversely affect the business, financial condition and operatingresults of Vitas.     Further, under separate statutes, submission of claims for items orservices that are ""not provided as claimed"" may lead to civil money penalties,criminal fines and imprisonment and/or exclusion from participation in Medicare,Medicaid and other federally funded state health care programs. These falseclaims statutes include the federal False Claims Act, which allows any person tobring suit on behalf of the federal government, known as a qui tam action,alleging false or fraudulent Medicare or Medicaid claims or other violations ofthe statute and to share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government infines or settlement. Any entity found to be violating the False Claims Act maybe liable for up to $11,000 per false claim and treble the amount of damages thefederal government is found to have sustained because of the false claims.     Certificate of Need Laws. Many states, including Florida, have certificateof need laws or other similar health planning laws that apply to hospice careproviders. These states may require some form of state agency review or approvalprior to opening a new hospice program, to adding or expanding hospice services,to undertaking significant capital expenditures or under other specifiedcircumstances. Approval under these certificate of need laws is generallyconditioned on the showing of a demonstrable need for services in the community.Vitas may seek to develop, acquire or expand hospice programs in states havingcertificate of need laws. To the extent that state agencies require Vitas toobtain a certificate of need or other similar approvals to expand services atexisting hospice programs or to make acquisitions or develop hospice programs innew or existing geographical markets, Vitas' plans could be adversely affectedby a failure to obtain a certificate or approval. In addition, competitors mayseek administratively or judicially to challenge such an approval or proposedapproval                                       21by the state agency, and Vitas has been defending against such a challenge inconnection with the development of its Palm Beach County, Florida hospiceprogram. Such a challenge, whether or not ultimately successful, could adverselyaffect Vitas.     Other Federal and State Regulations. The federal government and all statesregulate various aspects of the hospice industry and Vitas' business. Inparticular, Vitas' operations are subject to federal and state health regulatorylaws, including those covering professional services, the dispensing of drugsand certain types of hospice activities. Certain of Vitas' employees are subjectto state laws and regulations governing professional practice. Vitas' operationsare subject to periodic survey by governmental authorities and privateaccrediting entities to assure compliance with applicable state licensing, andMedicare and Medicaid certification and accreditation standards, as the case maybe. From time to time in the ordinary course of business, Vitas receives surveyreports noting deficiencies for alleged failure to comply with applicablerequirements. Vitas reviews such reports and takes appropriate correctiveaction. The failure to effect such action could result in one of Vitas' hospiceprograms being terminated from the Medicare hospice program. Any termination ofone or more of Vitas' hospice locations from the Medicare hospice program couldadversely affect Vitas' net patient service revenue and profitability andadversely affect its financial condition and results of operations. The failureto obtain, renew or maintain any of the required regulatory approvals,certifications or licenses could materially adversely affect Vitas' business andcould prevent the programs involved from offering products and services topatients. In addition, laws and regulations often are adopted to regulate newproducts, services and industries. We cannot assure you that either the statesor the federal government will not impose additional regulations on Vitas'activities, which might materially adversely affect Vitas.     Claims Review. The Medicare and Medicaid programs and their fiscalintermediaries and other payors periodically conduct pre-payment or post-paymentreviews and other reviews and audits of health care claims, including hospiceclaims. As a result of such reviews or audits, Vitas could be required to returnany amounts found to be overpaid, or amounts found to be overpaid could berecouped through reductions in future payments. There is pressure from state andfederal governments and other payors to scrutinize health care claims todetermine their validity and appropriateness. During the past several years,Vitas' claims have been subject to review and audit. We cannot assure you thatreviews and/or similar audits of Vitas' claims will not result in materialrecoupments, denials or other actions that could have a material adverse effecton Vitas' business, financial condition and results of operations. See thediscussion of OIG investigation pending against Vitas under Other Health CareRegulations, above.     Regulation and Provision of Continuous Home Care. Vitas provides continuoushome care to patients requiring such care. Continuous home care is provided topatients while at home, during periods of crisis when intensive monitoring andcare, primarily nursing care, is required in order to achieve palliation ormanagement of acute medical symptoms. Continuous home care requires a minimum of8 hours of care within a 24-hour day, which begins and ends at midnight. Thecare must be predominantly nursing care provided by either a registered nurse orlicensed practical nurse.     Continuous home care can be challenging for a hospice to provide for anumber of reasons, including the need to have available sufficient skilled andtrained staff to furnish such care, the need to manage the staffing andprovision of such care, and a shortage of nurses that can make it particularlydifficult to attract and retain nurses that are required to furnish a majorityof such care. Medicare reimbursement for continuous home care is calculated bymultiplying the applicable continuous home care hourly rate by the number ofhours of care provided.     Medicare reimbursement for continuous home care is subject to a number ofrequirements posing further challenges for a hospice providing such care. Forexample, if a patient requires skilled interventions for palliation or symptommanagement that can be accomplished in less than 8 aggregate hours within the24-hour period, if the majority of care can be accomplished by someone otherthan a registered nurse or a licensed practical nurse (e.g., if a majority ofcare is furnished by a home health aide or homemaker), or if for any reason lessthan 8 hours of direct care are provided (such as when a patient dies before 8AM even if 7 or more hours of care has been provided),                                       22the care rendered cannot be reimbursed by Medicare at the continuous home carerate (although the care instead may be eligible for Medicare reimbursement atthe reduced routine home care day rate). As a result of such requirements, Vitasmay incur the costs of providing services intended to be continuous home careservices yet be unable to bill or be reimbursed for such services at thecontinuous home care rate. We cannot assure you that challenges in providingcontinuous home care will not cause Vitas' net patient service revenue andprofits to materially decline or that reviews and/or similar audits of Vitas'claims will not result in material recoupments, denials or other actions thatcould have a material adverse effect on Vitas' business, financial condition andresults of operations.     Compliance. Vitas maintains an internal regulatory compliance reviewprogram and from time to time retains regulatory counsel for guidance oncompliance matters. We cannot assure you, however, that Vitas' practices, ifreviewed, would be found to be in compliance with applicable health regulatorylaws, as such laws ultimately may be interpreted, or that any non-compliancewith such laws would not have a material adverse effect on Vitas.FEDERAL AND STATE LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY INITIATIVES RELATING TO PATIENTPRIVACY COULD REQUIRE VITAS TO EXPEND SUBSTANTIAL SUMS ON ACQUIRING,IMPLEMENTING AND SUPPORTING NEW INFORMATION SYSTEMS, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELYIMPACT ITS PROFITABILITY.     There are currently numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives at boththe state and federal levels that address patient privacy concerns. Inparticular, regulations issued under the Health Insurance Portability andAccountability Act of 1996 (""HIPAA"") require Vitas to protect the privacy andsecurity of patients' individual health information. We cannot predict the totalfinancial or other impact of the regulations on Vitas' operations. In addition,although Vitas' management believes it is in compliance with the requirement ofpatient privacy regulations, we cannot assure you that Vitas will not be foundto have violated state and federal laws, rules or guidelines surrounding patientprivacy. Compliance with current and future HIPAA requirements or any otherfederal or state privacy initiatives could require Vitas to make substantialinvestments, which could negatively impact its profitability and cash flows.VITAS' GROWTH STRATEGIES MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT ITSBUSINESS.     A significant element of Vitas' growth strategy is expected to includeexpansion of its business by developing new hospice locations in new andexisting markets. This aspect of Vitas' growth strategy may not be successful,which could adversely impact its growth and profitability. We cannot assure youthat Vitas will be able to:          -    identify markets that meet its selection criteria for new hospice               locations;          -    hire and retain qualified management teams to operate each of its               new hospice locations;          -    manage a large and geographically diverse group of hospice               locations;          -    become Medicare and Medicaid certified in new markets;          -    generate sufficient hospice admissions in new markets to operate               profitably in these new markets;          -    compete effectively with existing hospices in new markets; or          -    obtain state licensure and/or a certificate of need from               appropriate state agencies in new markets.     In addition to growing existing locations and developing new hospicelocations, Vitas' growth strategy is expected to include expansion throughacquisition of other                                       23hospices. We cannot assure you that Vitas' acquisition strategy will besuccessful. The success of Vitas' acquisition strategy depends upon a number offactors, including:          -    its ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates;          -    its ability to negotiate favorable acquisition terms, including               purchase price, which may be adversely affected due to increased               competition with other buyers;          -    the availability of financing on favorable terms, or at all;          -    its ability to integrate effectively the systems and operations               of acquired hospices;          -    its ability to retain key personnel of acquired hospices; and          -    its ability to obtain required regulatory approvals.     Acquisitions involve a number of other risks, including diversion ofmanagement's attention from other business concerns and assuming known orunknown liabilities of acquired hospices, including liabilities for failure tocomply with health care laws and regulations. Integrating acquired hospices mayplace significant strains on Vitas' current operating and financial systems andcontrols. Vitas may not successfully overcome these risks or any other problemsencountered in connection with its acquisition strategy.     In addition, since 1990, Vitas has acquired hospice programs, some of whichinvolved acquisitions of hospice programs from not-for-profit entities. Vitasbelieves that acquisitions of not-for-profit programs are generally more complexthan acquisitions from for-profit entities and that a substantial number ofacquisition opportunities are likely to involve acquisitions from not-for-profitentities. Such acquisitions are subject to provisions of the Internal RevenueCode and, in certain states, state attorney general powers, which have beeninterpreted to require that the consideration paid for the assets purchased beat fair market value and, where applicable, that any fees paid for services bereasonable. In many states there is no mechanism for state attorney generalpre-clearance of transactions to assure that applicable standards have been met.Entities that acquire not-for-profit hospices could face potential liability ifthe acquisition transaction is not structured to comply with Internal RevenueCode and state law requirements, and in some cases the transaction could beenjoined or subject to rescission. The acquisition of not-for-profit businesses,including the fairness of the purchase price paid, has received increasingregulatory scrutiny by state attorneys general and other regulatory authorities.Although Vitas believes that reasonable actions have been taken to date toestablish the fair market value of assets purchased in prior acquisitions ofhospice operations from not-for-profit entities and the reasonableness of feespaid for services, we cannot assure you that such transactions or any futuresimilar transactions will not be challenged or that, if challenged, the resultsof such challenge would not have a material adverse effect on Vitas' business.VITAS' LOSS OF KEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL OR ITS INABILITY TO HIRE AND RETAINSKILLED EMPLOYEES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION ANDRESULTS OF OPERATIONS.     Vitas' future success significantly depends upon the continued service ofits senior management personnel. The loss of one or more of Vitas' key seniormanagement personnel or its inability to hire and retain new skilled employeescould negatively impact Vitas' ability to maintain or increase patientreferrals, a key aspect of its growth strategy, and could adversely affect itsfuture operating results.     Competition for skilled employees is intense, and the process of locatingand recruiting skilled employees with the combination of qualifications andattributes required to care effectively for terminally ill patients and theirfamilies can be difficult and lengthy. We cannot assure you that Vitas will besuccessful in                                       24attracting, retaining or training highly skilled nursing, management, communityeducation, operations, admissions and other personnel. Vitas' business could bedisrupted and its growth and profitability negatively impacted if it is unableto attract and retain skilled employees.A NATIONWIDE SHORTAGE OF QUALIFIED NURSES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT VITAS'PROFITABILITY, GROWTH AND ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE QUALITY, RESPONSIVEHOSPICE SERVICES TO ITS PATIENTS AS NURSING WAGES AND BENEFITS INCREASE.     The substantial majority of Vitas' workforce is nurses. Vitas depends onqualified nurses to provide quality, responsive hospice services to itspatients. The current nationwide shortage of qualified nurses impacts some ofthe markets in which Vitas provides hospice services. In response to thisshortage, Vitas has adjusted its wages and benefits to recruit and retain nursesand to engage contract nurses. Vitas' inability to attract and retain qualifiednurses could adversely affect its ability to provide quality, responsive hospiceservices to its patients and its ability to increase or maintain patient censusin those markets. Increases in the wages and benefits required to attract andretain qualified nurses or an increase in reliance on contract nurses couldnegatively impact profitability.VITAS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY AGAINST OTHER HOSPICE PROVIDERS,AND COMPETITIVE PRESSURES MAY LIMIT ITS ABILITY TO MAINTAIN OR INCREASE ITSMARKET POSITION AND ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS PROFITABILITY, FINANCIAL CONDITION ANDRESULTS OF OPERATIONS.     Hospice care in the United States is highly competitive. In many areas inwhich Vitas' hospices are located, they compete with a large number oforganizations, including:          -    community-based hospice providers;          -    national and regional companies;          -    hospital-based hospice and palliative care programs;          -    physician groups;          -    nursing homes;          -    home health agencies;          -    infusion therapy companies; and          -    nursing agencies     Various health care companies have diversified into the hospice market.Other companies, including hospitals and health care organizations that are notcurrently providing hospice care, may enter the markets Vitas serves and expandthe variety of services offered to include hospice care. We cannot assure youthat Vitas will not encounter increased competition in the future that couldlimit its ability to maintain or increase its market position, includingcompetition from parties in a position to impact referrals to Vitas. Suchincreased competition could have a material adverse effect on Vitas' business,financial condition and results of operations.CHANGES IN RATES OR METHODS OF PAYMENT FOR VITAS' SERVICES COULD ADVERSELYAFFECT ITS REVENUES AND PROFITS.     Managed care organizations have grown substantially in terms of thepercentage of the population that is covered by such organizations and in termsof their control over an increasing portion of the health care economy. Managedcare organizations have continued to consolidate to enhance their ability toinfluence the delivery of health care services and to exert pressure to controlhealth care costs. Vitas has a number of contractual arrangements with managedcare organizations and other similar parties.                                       25     Vitas provides hospice care to many Medicare beneficiaries who receivetheir non-hospice health care services from health maintenance organizations(""HMOs"") under Medicare risk contracts. Under such contracts between HMOs andthe federal Department of Health and Human Services, the Medicare payments forhospice services are excluded from the per-member, per-month payment fromMedicare to HMOs and instead are paid directly by Medicare to the hospices. As aresult, Vitas' payments for Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare riskHMOs are processed in the same way with the same rates as other Medicarebeneficiaries. We cannot assure, however, that payment for hospice services willcontinue to be excluded from HMO payment under Medicare risk contracts andsimilar Medicare managed care plans or that if not excluded, managed careorganizations or other large third-party payors would not use their power toinfluence and exert pressure on health care providers to reduce costs in amanner that could have a material adverse effect on Vitas' business, financialcondition and results of operations.LIABILITY CLAIMS MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON VITAS, AND ITS INSURANCE COVERAGEMAY BE INADEQUATE.     Participants in the hospice industry are subject to lawsuits allegingnegligence, product liability or other similar legal theories, many of whichinvolve large claims and significant defense costs. From time to time, Vitas issubject to such and other types of lawsuits. See the description below underLegal Proceedings. The ultimate liability for claims, if any, could have amaterial adverse effect on its financial condition or operating results.Although Vitas currently maintains liability insurance intended to cover theclaims, we cannot assure you that the coverage limits of such insurance policieswill be adequate or that all such claims will be covered by the insurance. Inaddition, Vitas' insurance policies must be renewed annually and may be subjectto cancellation during the policy period. While Vitas has been able to obtainliability insurance in the past, such insurance varies in cost, is difficult toobtain and may not be available in the future on terms acceptable to Vitas, ifat all.     A successful claim in excess of the insurance coverage could have amaterial adverse effect on Vitas. Claims, regardless of their merit or eventualoutcome, also may have a material adverse effect on Vitas' business andreputation due to the costs of litigation, diversion of management's time andrelated publicity.     Vitas procures professional liability coverage on a claims-made basis. Theinsurance contracts specify that coverage is available only during the term ofeach insurance contract. Vitas' management intends to renew or replace theexisting claims-made policy annually but such coverage is difficult to obtain,may be subject to cancellation and may be written by carriers that are unable,or unwilling to pay claims. During fiscal 2001, Vitas was notified that one ofits prior carriers was ordered into rehabilitation, and in early fiscal 2002,into liquidation, creating the possibility that certain prior year claims couldbe underinsured or uninsured. Certain claims have been asserted where thecoverage would be the responsibility of this prior carrier and/or other carriersthat may not have the financial wherewithal to satisfy the claims. Additionally,some risks and liabilities, including claims for punitive damages, are notcovered by insurance"
