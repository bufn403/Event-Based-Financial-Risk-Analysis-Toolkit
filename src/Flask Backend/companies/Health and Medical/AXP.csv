0,AXP,AMERICAN EXPRESS CO,2007-03-01,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS     This section highlights specific risks that could affect our Company and its businesses. Youshould carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth inthis Annual Report on Form 10-K. Based on the information currently known to us, we believe thatthe following information identifies the most significant risk factors affecting our Company.However, the risks and uncertainties our Company faces are not limited to those described below.Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to beimmaterial may also adversely affect our business.     If any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events or thecircumstances described in the risks and uncertainties occur, these events or circumstances couldhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.These events could also have a negative effect on the trading price of our securities.     We face increasingly intense competitive pressure which may impact the prices we chargemerchants who accept our cards for payment for goods and services.     Unlike our competitors in the payments industry that rely on high revolving credit balances todrive profits, our business model is focused on Cardmember spending. Discount revenue, whichrepresents fees charged to merchants when Cardmembers use their Cards to purchase goods andservices on our network, is primarily driven by billed business volumes and is our largest singlerevenue source. In recent years, we have been under market pressure to reduce merchant discountrates and undertake other repricing initiatives. This pressure arises, in part, due to theregulatory pressure on our competitors outside the United States, which has been increasing. If wecontinue to experience a decline in the average merchant discount rate we charge merchants or areunable to sustain premium merchant discount rates on our Cards without experiencing overall volumegrowth or an increase in merchant coverage, our revenues and profitability could be materially andadversely affected.     We may not be able to increase consumer and business spending and borrowing on our paymentservices products or manage the costs of our Cardmember benefits intended to stimulate such use.     Our business is characterized by the high level of spending by our Cardmembers. Increasingconsumer and business spending and borrowing on our payment services products, particularly creditand charge Cards and Travelers Cheques and other prepaid products, and growth in Card lendingbalances, depend in part on our ability to develop and issue new or42Table of Contentsenhanced Card and prepaid products and increase revenues from such products. It also dependson our ability to attract new Cardmembers, reduce Cardmember attrition, increase merchant coverage,and capture a greater share of customers total spending on Cards issued on our network, both inthe United States and in our international operations. One of the ways in which we attract newCardmembers is through our Membership Rewards program, as well as other Cardmember benefits. Wemay not be able to cost effectively manage and expand Cardmember benefits, including containing thegrowth of marketing, promotion and rewards expenses and Cardmember services expenses. If we arenot successful in increasing consumer and business spending or in managing the costs of ourCardmember benefits, our revenues and profitability could be negatively affected.     Our brand and reputation are key assets of our Company and our business may be affected by howwe are perceived in the marketplace.     Our brand and its attributes are key assets of the Company. Our ability to attract and retainconsumer Cardmembers and corporate clients is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of ourlevel of service, business practices and financial condition. Negative perceptions or publicityregarding these matters could damage our reputation among existing and potential Cardmembers andcorporate clients, which could make it difficult for us to attract new Cardmembers and maintainexisting ones. Adverse developments with respect to our industry may also, by association,negatively impact our reputation, or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny.Although we monitor developments for areas of potential risk to our reputation and brand, negativeperceptions or publicity could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.     An increase in account data breaches and fraudulent activity using our Cards could lead toreputational damage to our brand and could reduce the use and acceptance of our charge and creditCards.     We and other third parties store Cardmember account information in connection with our chargeand credit Cards. Criminals are using increasingly sophisticated methods to capture various typesof information relating to Cardmembers accounts, including Membership Rewards accounts, to engagein illegal activities such as fraud and identity theft. As outsourcing and specialization become amore acceptable way of doing business in the payments industry, there are more third partiesinvolved in processing transactions using our Cards. If data breaches or fraud levels involvingour Cards were to rise, it could lead to regulatory intervention (such as mandatory cardreissuance) and reputational and financial damage to our brand, which could reduce the use andacceptance of our Cards, and have a material adverse impact on our business.     Our reengineering and other cost control initiatives may not prove successful and we may notrealize all or a significant portion of the benefits that we intended.     We have regularly undertaken, and are currently considering undertaking, a variety of effortsto reengineer our business operations in order to achieve cost savings and other benefits(including the reinvestment of such savings in key areas such as marketing, promotion and rewards),enhance revenue-generating opportunities and improve our operating expense to43Table of Contentsrevenue ratio both in the short-term and over time. These efforts include cost management,structural and strategic measures such as vendor, process, facilities and operations consolidation,outsourcing functions (including, among others, technologies operations), relocating certainfunctions to lower cost overseas locations, moving internal and external functions to the Internetto save costs and planned staff reductions relating to certain of these reengineering actions. Ifwe do not successfully achieve these efforts in a timely manner or if we are not able to capitalizeon these efforts, we may not realize all or a significant portion of the benefits that we intended.Failure to achieve these benefits could have a negative effect on our financial condition andresults of operations.     We have agreements with business partners in a variety of industries, including the airlineindustry, that represent a significant portion of our billed business. We are exposed to the riskof downturns in these industries, including bankruptcies of our partners, and the possibleobligation to make payments to our partners.     In the ordinary course of our business we enter into different types of contractualarrangements with business partners in a variety of industries. For example, we have partneredwith Costco to offer cobranded cards for consumers and small businesses, and through our MembershipRewards program we have partnered with businesses in many industries, most notably the airlineindustry, to offer benefits to Cardmember participants. The airline industry represents asignificant portion of our billed business and in recent years has undergone bankruptcies,restructurings and other similar events. In particular, we are exposed to risk under ouragreements with Delta Air Lines, which were restructured in connection with Deltas filing forprotection under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. For additional information relating to theagreements with Delta, see Financial Review  AirlineIndustry Matters on page 60 of our 2006Annual Report to Shareholders. In addition, under some types of these contractual arrangements,upon the occurrence of certain triggering events, we may be obligated to make payments to certaincobrand partners, merchants, vendors and customers. If we are not able to effectively manage thetriggering events, we could unexpectedly have to make payments to these partners, which could havea negative effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We are also exposed torisk if we are not able to effectively manage bankruptcies, restructurings, consolidations andother similar events that may occur in the airline industry or any other industry representing asignificant portion of our billed business, including any potential negative effects on particularcard products and services (and billed business generally) that could result from the actual orperceived weakness of key business partners in such industries.     Our risk management policies and procedures may not be effective.     We must effectively manage credit risk related to consumer debt, business loans, merchantbankruptcies and other credit trends and the rate of bankruptcies, which can affect spending oncard products, debt payments by individual and corporate customers and businesses that accept ourcard products. Credit risk is the risk of loss from obligor or counterparty default. We areexposed to both consumer credit risk, principally from Cardmember receivables, and our otherconsumer lending activities and institutional credit risk from merchants and GNS partners. Whileconsumer credit risk is more closely linked to general economic conditions rather thanborrower-specific events like institutional credit risk, both expose us to a risk of loss. Third44Table of Contentsparties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operationalfailure or other reasons. Country, regional and political risks are components of credit risk.Rising delinquencies and rising rates of bankruptcy are often precursors of future write-offs andmay require us to increase our reserve for loan losses. Higher write-off rates and an increase inour reserve for loan losses may adversely affect our profitability and the performance of oursecuritizations, and may increase our cost of funds.     Although we make estimates to provide for credit losses in our outstanding portfolio of loansand receivables, these estimates may not be accurate. In addition, the information that we use inmanaging our credit risk may be inaccurate or incomplete. Although we regularly review our creditexposure to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries, countries and regionsthat we believe may present credit concerns, default risk may arise from events or circumstancesthat are difficult to foresee or detect, such as fraud. We may also fail to receive fullinformation with respect to the credit risks of our customers.     We must also effectively manage market risk to which we are exposed. Market risk representsthe loss in value of portfolios and financial instruments due to adverse changes in marketvariables. We are exposed to market risk from interest rates in our Card business. Changes in theinterest rates at which we borrow and lend money affect the value of our assets and liabilities.If the rate of interest we pay on our borrowings increases more than the rate of interest we earnon our loans, our net finance charge revenue, and consequently our net income, could fall.     We must also accurately estimate the fair value of the assets in our investment portfolio and,in particular, those investments that are not readily marketable, including the valuation of theinterest-only strip (commonly referred to as the I/O strip) arising from our securitization ofcharge and credit Card receivables.     Finally, we must also manage the operational risks to which we are exposed. We consideroperational risk to be the risk of not achieving our business objectives due to failed processes,people or information systems, or from the external environment, such as natural disasters.Operational risks include the risk that we may not accurately estimate the expense provision forthe cost of our Membership Rewards program, as well as the risk that we are unable to manage adownturn in our businesses and/or negative changes in our and our subsidiaries credit ratings,which could result in contingent payments under contracts, decreased liquidity and higher borrowingcosts.     Although we have devoted significant resources to develop our risk management policies andprocedures and expect to continue to do so in the future, our hedging strategies and other riskmanagement techniques may not be fully effective. See Financial Review  Risk Management onpages 49-53 of our 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders for a discussion of the policies andprocedures we use to identify, monitor and manage the risks we assume in conducting our businesses.Management of credit, market and operational risk requires, among other things, policies andprocedures to record properly and verify a large number of transactions and events, and thesepolicies and procedures may not be fully effective.45Table of Contents     Adverse currency fluctuations and foreign exchange controls could decrease revenue we receivefrom our international operations.     During 2006, over 30% of our revenue was generated from activities outside the United States.We are exposed to foreign exchange risk from our international operations, and some of the revenuewe generate outside the United States is subject to unpredictable and indeterminate fluctuations ifthe values of other currencies change relative to the U.S. dollar. Resulting exchange gains andlosses are included in our net income. Furthermore, we may become subject to exchange controlregulations that might restrict or prohibit the conversion of our other revenue currencies intoU.S. dollars. The occurrence of any of these events or circumstances could decrease the revenueswe receive from our international operations and have a material adverse effect on our business.     Our access to financing, including securitizations, may be limited.     In general, the amount, type and cost of our funding, including financing from other financialinstitutions and the capital markets, directly impacts our expense in operating our business andgrowing our assets and therefore, can positively or negatively affect our financial results.     A number of factors could make such financing more difficult, more expensive or unavailable onany terms both domestically and internationally (where funding transactions may be on terms more orless favorable than in the United States), including, but not limited to, financial results andlosses, changes within our organization, specific events that adversely impact our reputation,changes in the activities of our business partners, disruptions in the capital markets, specificevents that adversely impact the financial services industry, counter-party availability, changesaffecting our assets, our corporate and regulatory structure, interest rate fluctuations, ratingsagencies actions, general economic conditions and the legal, regulatory, accounting and taxenvironments governing our funding transactions. In addition, our ability to raise funds isstrongly affected by the general state of the United States and world economies, and may becomeincreasingly difficult due to economic and other factors. Also, we compete for funding with otherfinancial institutions, some of which are publicly traded. Competition from these institutions mayincrease our cost of funds.     Inaddition, we periodically securitize Cardmember receivables and loans arising from our Cardbusiness. Securitization involves the legal sale of beneficial interests in Cardmember receivablesand loan balances to a trust, which in turn issues securities to third-party investorscollateralized by the transferred receivables and loans, and our receipt of the proceeds from theissuance of such securities. Although the markets for securitized credit and charge cardreceivables and loans is large and well-established, if these markets experience difficulties, wemay be unable to securitize our receivables or to do so at favorable pricing levels. If we wereunable to continue to securitize our loan receivables at desired levels, we would use alternativefunding sources to meet our liquidity needs. If we were unable to find cost-effective and stablealternatives, it could negatively impact our liquidity and potentially subject us to certain risks.These risks would include an increase in our cost of funds, an increase in the allowance for loan46Table of Contentslosses and the provision for possible credit losses as more loans would remain on ourconsolidated balance sheet, and lower loan growth.     In addition, the occurrence of certain events may cause the securitization transactions toamortize earlier than scheduled, which would accelerate the need for an alternate source offunding.     For a further discussion of our liquidity and funding needs, see Financial Review  FundingStrategy on pages 43-48 in the 2006 Annual Report to Shareholders.     If we are not able to invest successfully in, and compete at the leading edge of,technological developments across all our businesses, our revenue and profitability could benegatively affected.     Our industry is subject to rapid and significant technological changes. In order to competein our industry, we need to continue to invest in technologies across all areas of our business,including in transaction processing, data management, customer interactions and communications,travel reservations systems, prepaid products, alternative payment mechanisms and risk managementand compliance systems. We rely in part on third parties, including some of our competitors andpotential competitors, for the development of and access to new technologies. We expect that newservices and technologies applicable to the payments industry will continue to emerge, and thesenew services and technologies may be superior to, or render obsolete, the technologies we currentlyuse in our Cards and networks. In addition, our ability to adopt new services and technologiesthat we develop may be inhibited by a need for industry-wide standards or by resistance fromCardmembers or merchants to such changes in addition to patent rights held by competitors orothers. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to develop or adapt totechnological changes and evolving industry standards.     Our operating results may suffer because of substantial and increasingly intense competitionworldwide in the payments industry.     The payments industry is highly competitive and includes, in addition to credit card networks,evolving alternative payment mechanisms and systems. Some of our competitors have developed, ormay develop, substantially greater financial and other resources than we have, may offer a widerrange of programs and services than we offer or may use more effective advertising and marketingstrategies to achieve broader brand recognition or merchant acceptance than we have. We may notcontinue to be able to compete effectively against these threats. In addition, our competitors maybe more efficient in introducing innovative products, programs and services than we are. As aresult, our revenue or profitability may decline.     Banks, card issuers and card network operators generally are the subject of increasing globalregulatory focus, which may impose costly new compliance burdens on our company and lead todecreased transaction volumes through our network.     We are subject to regulations that affect banks and the payments industry in the manycountries in which our charge and credit Cards are used and where we conduct banking47Table of Contentsactivities. In particular, we are subject to numerous regulations applicable to financialinstitutions in the United States and abroad. We are also subject to regulations as a provider ofservices to financial institutions. Regulation of the payments industry has increasedsignificantly in recent years. For example, we are subject to the regulatory requirements of thePatriot Act, which substantially broadened existing anti-money laundering legislation and theextraterritorial jurisdiction of the United States. The Patriot Act requires us to create andimplement comprehensive anti-money laundering programs that meet certain standards, includingexpanded reporting and enhanced information gathering and record-keeping requirements, as well asto perform due diligence on the third party institutions that issue Cards and/or acquire merchantson our network. Increased regulatory focus in this area could result in additional obligations orrestrictions with respect to the types of products and services that we may offer to consumers, thecountries in which our charge and credit Cards may be used and where we provide private andcorrespondent banking services, and the types of cardholders and merchants who can obtain or acceptour charge and credit Cards.     The U.S. Congress is also presently considering legislative initiatives in the areas ofInternet gambling, Internet prescription drug purchases and copyright and trademark infringement,among others, that could impose additional compliance burdens on our Company, for example, imposingrequirements aimed at preventing the use of payment cards to unlawfully purchase prescription drugsover the Internet. Many states are also considering a variety of similar legislation. Federal andstate law enforcement authorities have also contacted payment companies concerning these issues.If implemented, these initiatives may require us to monitor, filter, restrict, or otherwise overseevarious categories of charge and credit card transactions, thereby increasing our costs ordecreasing our transaction volumes. Various regulatory agencies are also considering regulationscovering identity theft, account management guidelines, disclosure rules, security, and marketingthat would impact us directly, in part due to increased scrutiny of our underwriting standards.These new requirements may restrict our ability to issue charge and credit cards or partner withother financial institutions, which could decrease our transaction volumes. In some circumstances,new regulations could have the effect of limiting our ability to offer new types of charge orcredit cards or restricting our ability to offer existing Cards, such as stored value cards, whichcould materially and adversely reduce our revenues and revenue growth.     In the United States, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and various FederalReserve Banks have been following developments on interchange and have held several conferencesfocused on credit card interchange rates. While the Federal Reserve has expressed interest inmonitoring this issue, it has not indicated the need to regulate interchange rates in the UnitedStates. In Congress, there have been several hearings on VISA and MasterCard interchange over thelast year. During 2006, there were also a number of bills proposed in individual statelegislatures seeking to impose caps on credit card interchange or to prohibit card companies fromcharging merchant discount on the state tax portion of credit card purchases. None of those billswere enacted. It is expected that Congressional hearings and similar proposed state legislationwill continue during 2007.48Table of Contents     Regulators and Congress have also increased their scrutiny of our industrys fees to itscustomers. Any legislative or regulatory restrictions on our ability to price our services freelycould materially and adversely affect our transaction volume and revenues.     Increased regulatory focus on our Company, such as in connection with the matters discussedabove, may increase our compliance costs or result in a reduction of transactions processed on ournetworks, which could materially and adversely impact our financial performance.     Existing and proposed regulation in the areas of consumer privacy and data use and securitycould decrease the number of charge and credit cards issued and could increase our costs.     We are also subject to regulations related to privacy and data use and security in thejurisdictions in which we do business, and we could be negatively impacted by these regulations.For example, in the United States, we are subject to the Federal Trade Commissions informationsafeguards rule under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. The rule requires that each financialinstitution develop, implement and maintain a written, comprehensive information security programcontaining safeguards that are appropriate to the financial institutions size and complexity, thenature and scope of the financial institutions activities, and the sensitivity of any customerinformation at issue. The heightened legislative and regulatory focus on data security, includingrequiring consumer notification in the event of a data breach, continues. In the United States,there are a number of bills pending in Congress and there have been several Congressional hearingsto address these issues. Congress will likely consider data security/data breach legislation in2007 that, if implemented, could affect our Company.     In addition, approximately 34 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia have enactedsecurity breach legislation, requiring varying levels of consumer notification in the event of asecurity breach, and several other states are considering similar legislation. In 1995, theEuropean Parliament and Council passed European Directive 95/46/EC on the protection of individualswith regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (commonlyreferred to as the Data Protection Directive), which obligates the controller of an individualspersonal data to take the necessary technical and organizational measures to protect personal data.The Data Protection Directive has been implemented through local laws regulating data protectionin European Union member states. Any additional regulations in these areas may also increase ourcosts to comply with such regulations, which could materially and adversely affect ourprofitability.     Global economic, political and other conditions may adversely affect trends in consumerspending and in travel.     Our business depends heavily upon the overall level of spending using our credit and chargeCards, and we are not insulated from the effects of economic cycles. A sustained deterioration ingeneral economic conditions, particularly in the United States or Europe, or increases in interestrates in key countries in which we operate, may adversely affect our financial performance byreducing the number or average purchase amount of transactions involving our charge and creditCards and result in increasing delinquencies and credit losses.49Table of ContentsPolitical or economic instability in certain regions or countries could also affect ourcommercial or other lending activities, among other businesses, or result in restrictions onconvertibility of certain currencies. In addition, our travel network may be adversely affected byworld geopolitical and other conditions. Travel expenditures are sensitive to business andpersonal discretionary spending levels and tend to decline during general economic downturns.     Terrorist attacks, natural disasters or other catastrophic events may have a negative effecton our business. Because of our proximity to the World Trade Center, our headquarters were damagedas a result of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Similar events or other disasters orcatastrophic events in the future could have a negative effect on our businesses andinfrastructure, including our information technology systems. Because we derive a portion of ourrevenues from travel-related spending, our business will be sensitive to safety concerns, and thusmay decline during periods in which travelers become concerned about safety issues or when travelmight involve health-related risks.     If our global network systems are disrupted or we are unable to process transactionsefficiently or at all, our revenue or profitability would be materially reduced.     Our transaction authorization, clearing and settlement systems may experience serviceinterruptions as a result of fire, natural disasters, power loss, disruptions in long distance orlocal telecommunications access, fraud, terrorism or accident. A natural disaster or other problemat our facilities could interrupt our services. Additionally, we rely on third-party serviceproviders for the timely transmission of information across our global network. If a serviceprovider fails to provide the communications capacity or services we require, as a result ofnatural disaster, operational disruption, terrorism or any other reason, the failure couldinterrupt our services, adversely affect the perception of our brands reliability and materiallyreduce our revenue or profitability.     We rely on third-party providers of various computer systems and other services integral tothe operations of our businesses. These third parties may act in ways that could harm ourbusiness.     We outsource to third-party providers many of our computer systems and other services that areintegral to the operations of our businesses. We are subject to the risk that certain decisionsare subject to the control of our third-party service providers and that these decisions mayadversely affect our activities. We cannot be certain that our third-party vendors will performtheir obligations as expected.     Resolution of our unresolved SEC staff comment may result in a change in the presentation ofour reportable operating segments in our financial statements.     Our business is comprised of three reportable operating segments, U.S. Card Services,International Card & Global Commercial Services and Global Network & Merchant Services. Inconnection with a review of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2005,the SEC requested certain information regarding the aggregation of our operating segments into thereportable segments identified above. The Company and the SEC are50Table of Contentscontinuing to discuss the Companys segment reporting. If, as a result of these discussions,it is concluded that a different reportable operating segment presentation (including thedisaggregation of certain operating segments) is appropriate, we would report our segmentsdifferently in our filings with the SEC (although consolidated results would not be impacted). TheSEC may also require that we restate segment information that appears in the notes to ourconsolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and file an amendmentto this Form 10-K to reflect any such changes to the reportable operating segment presentation.Special Note About Forward-Looking Statements     We have made various statements in this report that may constitute forward-lookingstatements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.Forward-looking statements may also be made in our other reports filed with the SEC, in our pressreleases and in other documents.
