15,ABT,ABBOTT LABORATORIES,2024-02-16,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS        In addition to the other information in this report, the following risk factors should be considered before deciding to invest in any of Abbott’s securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to Abbott, or risks Abbott currently considers immaterial, could also affect Abbott’s actual results. Abbott’s business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.Business and Operational RisksDisruptions to Abbott’s global supply chain, which is large and complex, could negatively affect Abbott’s results of operations.Abbott’s operations and performance depend on its ability to manage its large and complex global supply chain. While Abbott has taken and will continue to take actions to mitigate the risks of disruptions to its global supply chain, disruptions to it could negatively affect Abbott's results of operations. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic and macroeconomic conditions such as inflationary pressures and labor shortages contributed to global supply chain challenges over the last few years, which adversely impacted the cost and availability of certain raw materials, supplies, and services. A discussion on the global supply chain challenges and its resulting impact on Abbott’s business is contained in the “Financial Review” section in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this report.Abbott may acquire other businesses, license rights to technologies or products, form alliances, or dispose of or spin-off businesses, which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability.From time to time, Abbott pursues acquisitions, licensing arrangements, and strategic alliances, or may dispose of or spin-off some of its businesses, as part of its business strategy. Abbott may not complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and may not realize the expected benefits. If Abbott is successful in making an acquisition, the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated. Abbott may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business or transition disposed businesses efficiently, and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities. Abbott could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or disposition-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of long-term assets. These effects could cause a deterioration of Abbott’s credit rating, result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense, and decrease liquidity.Abbott depends on sophisticated information systems and maintains protected personal data, and a significant cybersecurity incident or other disruption affecting these information systems or protected data could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s business, financial condition and results of operations.Similar to other large multi-national companies, the size and complexity of the information systems on which Abbott relies for both its infrastructure and products make them susceptible to a cybersecurity incident, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy, or other significant disruption. These systems have been and are expected to continue to be the target of malware and other cybersecurity incidents. In addition, third party hacking attempts may cause Abbott’s information systems and related products, protected data, or proprietary information to be compromised or stolen. A significant cybersecurity incident or other disruption could result in adverse consequences, including regulatory inquiries or litigation, increased costs and expenses, manufacturing challenges or disruption, problems with product availability, functionality or safety, damage to customer relations, reputational damage, lost revenue, and fines or penalties.Abbott also collects, manages and processes protected personal data, including protected health information, in connection with certain medical products and service offerings. Abbott is subject to certain regional and local data protection laws that prohibit or restrict the transfer of protected data across country borders. For additional information concerning data privacy and security regulation, see the discussion in “Regulation” under Item 1, “Business.” A breach of protected personal information could result in adverse consequences, including regulatory inquiries or litigation, increased costs and expenses, reputational damage, lost revenue, and fines or penalties.9Table of ContentsAbbott invests in its information systems and technology and in the protection of its products and data to reduce the risk of a cybersecurity incident or other significant disruption, and monitors its information systems on an ongoing basis for any current or potential cybersecurity threats or vulnerabilities and for changes in technology and the regulatory environment. There can be no assurance that these measures and efforts will prevent future cybersecurity incidents or other significant disruptions to any of the information systems on which Abbott relies or that related product issues will not arise in the future. Similarly, there can be no assurance that third party information technology providers or other partners with whom Abbott contracts will not suffer a significant cybersecurity incident or disruption that impacts Abbott. Any significant cybersecurity incident or other disruption affecting Abbott’s information systems or products could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s business, financial condition and results of operations.Abbott’s research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and technologies, which may cause Abbott’s revenue and profitability to decline.To remain competitive, Abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies. To accomplish this, Abbott commits substantial efforts, funds, and other resources to research and development. A risk of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies. Abbott must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including after significant funds have been invested.Promising new products and technologies may fail to reach the market or may only have limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, limited scope of approved uses, excessive costs to manufacture, failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights, or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others. Even if Abbott successfully develops new products or enhancements or new generations of Abbott’s existing products, they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences, changing industry or regulatory standards, or competitors’ innovations. Innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of, among other things, entrenched patterns of clinical practice or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Abbott cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched, whether it will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire compounds or products, or whether any products will be commercially successful. Failure to launch successful new products or technologies, or new indications or uses for existing products, may cause Abbott’s products or technologies to become obsolete, causing Abbott’s revenues and operating results to suffer.The manufacture of many of Abbott's products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if Abbott or one of its suppliers or manufacturers encounters problems manufacturing products, Abbott’s business could suffer.The manufacture of many of Abbott’s products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials or the global supply chain, failure to meet product specifications, cybersecurity incidents, natural disasters, and environmental factors. In addition, single suppliers are currently used for certain products and materials. If problems arise during the production of a lot or batch of product, those products may have to be discarded. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred. Any of these events could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, reputational damage, time and expense spent investigating the cause and remediating the problem, if any, a production stoppage at a manufacturing facility, and depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other lots, batches or products. To the extent Abbott or one of its suppliers or manufacturers experiences significant manufacturing problems, this could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues and profitability.Abbott has significant indebtedness, which could adversely affect its business, including decreasing its business flexibility.As of December 31, 2023, Abbott's consolidated indebtedness was approximately $14.7 billion. This consolidated indebtedness could have the effect, among other things, of reducing Abbott's flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions, and reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes.Further, Abbott may be required to raise additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, future acquisitions or other general corporate purposes. Abbott's ability to arrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on, among other factors, Abbott's financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond Abbott's control. Consequently, Abbott cannot assure that it will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to Abbott or at all, which could adversely impact Abbott's ability to make scheduled payments with respect to its consolidated indebtedness and its profitability and financial condition.10Table of ContentsAdditionally, further borrowing could cause a deterioration of Abbott's credit ratings. Abbott's credit ratings reflect each credit rating agency's then opinion of Abbott's financial strength, operating performance, and ability to meet its debt obligations. Adverse changes in Abbott's credit ratings may result in increased borrowing costs for future long-term debt or short-term borrowing facilities and may limit financing options, including access to the unsecured borrowing market. Abbott may also be subject to additional restrictive covenants that would reduce flexibility.Legal and Regulatory RisksIt is costly for Abbott to comply with numerous governmental regulations and to develop compliant products and processes, and consequences for non-compliance could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues, profitability, cash flows, and financial condition.Abbott’s products are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous international, supranational, federal, and state authorities. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a drug, medical device, diagnostic product, or nutritional product can be costly and time-consuming, and approvals might not be granted for future products, or additional indications or uses of existing products, on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in the receipt of, or failure to obtain, approvals for future products, or new indications and uses, could result in delayed realization of product revenues, reduction in revenues, and substantial additional costs.In addition, no assurance can be given that Abbott will remain in compliance with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements once approval or marketing authorization has been obtained for a product. These requirements include, among other things, regulations regarding manufacturing practices, product labeling, and advertising and postmarketing reporting, including adverse event reports and field alerts. Many of Abbott’s facilities and procedures and those of Abbott’s suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation, including periodic inspection by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Abbott must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations. Possible regulatory actions for non-compliance include warning letters, fines, damages, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls, consent decrees, seizures of Abbott’s products, and civil litigation and/or criminal prosecution.These actions could result in, among other things, substantial modifications to Abbott’s business practices and operations; refunds, recalls, or seizures of Abbott’s products; a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more facilities while Abbott or Abbott’s suppliers remedy any actual or potential issues; the inability to obtain future pre-market approvals or marketing authorizations; and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market. Any of these events could disrupt Abbott’s business and have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues, profitability, cash flows, and financial condition. For information on Abbott’s voluntary recall in February 2022 of certain powder infant formula products manufactured at its facility in Sturgis, Michigan, the manufacturing stoppage at such facility, and the consent decree that Abbott entered into with the FDA on May 16, 2022, see the discussion in the “Financial Review” section in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this report. Laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on Abbott, require Abbott to change its business practices, and restrict its operations, which could result in a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues, profitability, and financial condition.Abbott’s industry is subject to various international, supranational, federal, and state laws and regulations pertaining to government benefit program reimbursement, price reporting and regulation, and health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback and false claims laws, and international and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices. Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, substantial fines, imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in government health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and Veterans Administration health programs in the U.S. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to evolving interpretations, which could require Abbott to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt Abbott’s business and result in a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues, profitability, and financial condition.Changes in the health care regulatory environment may adversely impact the demand for and price of Abbott’s products.Both in the U.S. and internationally, government authorities may enact changes in regulatory requirements, make legislative or administrative reforms to existing reimbursement programs, make adverse decisions relating to Abbott’s products’ coverage or reimbursement, or make changes to patient access to health care, all of which could adversely impact the demand for and usage of Abbott’s products or the prices that Abbott’s customers are willing to pay for them.11Table of ContentsFurther, in the U.S., a number of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 address access to health care products and services. These provisions may be modified, expanded, repealed, or otherwise invalidated, in whole or in part. Future rulemaking could affect rebates, prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, or required reporting and disclosure. Abbott cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking or changes in the law.For additional information concerning health care regulation, see the discussion in “Regulation” under Item 1, “Business.”The expiration or loss of intellectual property protection and licenses may affect Abbott’s future revenues and operating income.Many of Abbott’s businesses rely on patent and trademark and other intellectual property protection. Although most of the challenges to Abbott’s intellectual property have come from other companies, governments may also challenge intellectual property protections. To the extent Abbott’s intellectual property is successfully challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or to the extent it does not allow Abbott to compete effectively, Abbott’s businesses could suffer. To the extent that countries do not enforce Abbott’s intellectual property rights, Abbott’s future revenues and operating income could be reduced. Any material litigation regarding Abbott’s patents and trademarks is described in the section captioned “Legal Proceedings.”Significant safety concerns could arise for Abbott’s products, which could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues and financial condition.Health care products typically receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration. Following regulatory approval, these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients. Investigators may also conduct additional, and perhaps more extensive, studies. When new safety concerns are reported, Abbott may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product. For example, Abbott may be required to provide additional warnings on a product’s label or narrow its approved intended use, either of which could reduce the product’s market acceptance. If serious safety concerns arise with an Abbott product, sales of the product have been and could be halted by Abbott or by regulatory authorities. Safety concerns affecting suppliers’ or competitors’ products also may reduce the market acceptance of Abbott’s products.In addition, in the ordinary course of business, Abbott is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that its products or the products of other companies that Abbott promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for, or injury to, patients. Product liability claims and lawsuits, safety alerts or product recalls, and other allegations of product safety or quality issues, regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome, may have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s business and reputation and on Abbott’s ability to attract and retain customers. Consequences may also include additional costs, a decrease in market share for the products, lower income or exposure to other claims. Product liability losses are self-insured and could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s profitability, cash flows, and financial condition.Economic, Geopolitical and Industry RisksAbbott is subject to cost containment efforts that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operating income.In the United States and other countries, Abbott’s businesses have experienced downward pressure on certain product pricing. Cost containment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in the section captioned “Regulation.” To the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater patient access to health care or other factors, Abbott’s future revenues and operating income will be reduced.Competitors’ intellectual property may prevent Abbott from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s future profitability and financial condition.In the ordinary course of business, Abbott is the subject of patent litigation, such as competitor claims that an Abbott product infringes their intellectual property. Resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require Abbott to enter into license agreements. Abbott cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject Abbott to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture, sale or use of affected Abbott products. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s profitability and financial condition.12Table of ContentsNew products and technological advances by Abbott’s competitors may negatively affect Abbott’s results of operations.Abbott’s products face intense competition from competitors' products and technological advances. Competitors’ products may be safer, more effective, more effectively marketed or sold, or have lower prices or superior performance features than Abbott’s products. Further, the development of new technology, health care products and medicines, and the development of new treatments for disease could significantly change the competitive landscape of the health care industry and negatively impact the demand for certain Abbott products. Abbott cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction of competitors’ products and technological advances.Fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect Abbott’s financial statements and its ability to realize projected sales and earnings.Although Abbott’s financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of Abbott’s revenues and costs are realized in other currencies. Sales outside of the United States in 2023 made up approximately 61 percent of Abbott’s net sales. Abbott’s profitability is affected by movement of the U.S. dollar against other currencies. Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies may also affect the reported value of Abbott’s assets and liabilities, as well as its cash flows. Some foreign currencies are subject to government exchange controls. While Abbott enters into hedging arrangements to mitigate some of its foreign currency exposure, Abbott cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or its ability to mitigate these risks.Information on the impact of foreign exchange rates on Abbott’s financial results is contained in the “Financial Review — Results of Operations” section in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this report. A discussion of the steps taken to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange is contained in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, of this report. Information on Abbott’s hedging arrangements is contained in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in this report.Adverse changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretations, both in the U.S. and internationally, could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s effective tax rate, financial condition and results of operations.Abbott is a large, global corporation, and changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations could adversely affect Abbott’s overall tax liabilities. Changes in tax laws, regulations or interpretations, both in the U.S. and internationally, such as the two-pillared plan proposed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation & Development (OECD), could materially adversely affect Abbott’s effective tax rate, financial condition and results of operations. A discussion on the OECD proposals and their potential impact on Abbott’s business in the future is contained in the “Financial Review” section in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this report. Abbott is unable to predict what changes to the tax laws of the U.S. or other jurisdictions may be proposed or enacted in the future or what impact such changes would have on its business. Deterioration in the economic condition and credit quality of certain countries may negatively affect Abbott’s results of operations.Unfavorable economic conditions in certain countries may increase the time it takes to collect outstanding trade receivables or inhibit Abbott's ability to best utilize its cash. Financial instability and fiscal deficits in these countries may result in additional austerity measures to reduce costs, including health care. Deterioration in the quality of sovereign debt, including credit downgrades, could increase Abbott’s collection risk where a significant amount of Abbott’s receivables in these countries are with governmental health care systems or where Abbott’s customers depend on payment by government health care systems.Abbott is subject to risks related to public health crises, such as widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases like the COVID-19 pandemic, which had a material effect on Abbott’s business, financial condition and results of operations. As a global healthcare company, public health crises, such as the widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases like the COVID-19 pandemic, may negatively impact certain Abbott's operations. Health concerns and significant changes in political or economic conditions caused by such outbreaks can cause, and during the COVID-19 pandemic caused, significant reductions in demand for certain products, increased difficulty in serving customers, disruptions to manufacturing and supply chains, and negative effects on certain of Abbott’s operations as well as the operations of its suppliers, distributors and other third-party partners. Furthermore, such widespread outbreaks may impact, and during the COVID-19 pandemic impacted, the broader economies of affected countries, including negatively impacting economic growth, the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, inflation rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to global supply chain disruptions, which adversely impacted the cost and availability of certain raw materials, supplies, and services. 13Table of ContentsWith regard to COVID-19 diagnostic testing, the FDA issued Emergency Use Authorizations (EUA) for several COVID‑19 related products in 2020 and 2021, including Abbott diagnostic tests. EUAs are authorized pursuant to an EUA Declaration under the U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and remain in effect until the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services terminates the EUA Declaration or unless sooner terminated or revoked. Abbott is actively pursuing the FDA’s customary regulatory approval process for various COVID-19 diagnostic tests, which has uncertainty as discussed in “Abbott is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes.” in “Legal and Regulatory Risks” under “Item 1A. Risk Factors
.” The U.S. federal public health emergency (PHE) expired on May 11, 2023, which has not impacted the availability of the products authorized under the EUAs. Abbott will continue to monitor further regulatory actions from relevant U.S. government agencies and assess potential impacts on pandemic-related government policies and product authorizations. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic has shifted to an endemic state, resulting in significantly lower demand for COVID-19 tests.A more detailed discussion on the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic had on Abbott’s business is contained in the “Financial Review” section in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of this report.The international nature of Abbott’s business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause its revenue and profitability to decline.Abbott’s business is subject to risks associated with managing a global supply chain and doing business internationally. Sales outside of the United States in 2023 made up approximately 61 percent of Abbott’s net sales. Additional risks associated with Abbott’s international operations include:•differing local product preferences and product requirements;•trade protection measures, including tariffs, import or export licensing requirements, other governmental restrictions such as trade sanctions, and changes to international trade agreements;•difficulty in establishing, staffing, and managing operations;•differing labor regulations;•potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;•geopolitical and economic instability, including sovereign debt issues;•restrictions on local currency conversion and/or cash extraction;•price controls, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization, and other governmental action;•inflation, recession, and fluctuations in interest rates;•diminished protection of intellectual property; and•potential penalties or other adverse consequences for violations of anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and other similar laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act.Events contemplated by these risks may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues and profitability.Other factors can have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s future profitability and financial condition.Many other factors can affect Abbott’s profitability and its financial condition, including:•changes in or interpretations of laws and regulations, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements, product approval standards, product labeling standards, source and use laws, and environmental laws;•differences between the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and their actual value, particularly for pensions, retiree health care, stock compensation, intangibles, goodwill, and contingent consideration; and for contingent liabilities such as litigation, the absence of a recorded amount, or an amount recorded at the minimum, compared to the actual amount;•changes in the rate of inflation (including the cost of raw materials, labor, commodities, and supplies), interest rates, market value of Abbott’s equity investments, and the performance of investments held by Abbott or Abbott’s employee benefit trusts;14Table of Contents•changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties that transact business with or provide services to Abbott or Abbott’s employee benefit trusts;•changes in business, economic, and geopolitical conditions, including: war, political instability, terrorist attacks, the threat of future terrorist activity and related military action; global climate change, extreme weather and natural disasters; the cost and availability of insurance due to any of the foregoing events; labor disputes, strikes, slow-downs, or other forms of labor or union activity; and pressure from third-party interest groups;•changes in Abbott’s business units and investments and changes in the relative and absolute contribution of each to earnings and cash flow resulting from evolving business strategies, and changing product mix;•changes in the buying patterns of a major distributor, retailer, wholesaler, or other customer resulting from buyer purchasing decisions, pricing, seasonality, or other factors, or other problems with licensors, suppliers, distributors, and business partners; and•legal difficulties, any of which could preclude or delay commercialization of products or adversely affect profitability, including claims asserting statutory or regulatory violations, and adverse litigation decisions.Many of these factors may manifest individually or collectively, such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine which resulted in political instability, sanctions, economic and currency volatility, inflation and other operational and supply disruptions. To date, Abbott has been able to manage these disruptions without material impact to its results of operations. However, it is difficult to predict the future implications and consequences of the situation on local, regional or global economies and Abbott’s operations. There could be additional sanctions, economic volatility, cybersecurity threats, political instability, transportation and other supply disruptions, as well as collection default or liquidity risks or limited availability of resources to conduct essential business processes that could have a material adverse impact to Abbott’s operations and financial condition. The resolution and long-term impact of this matter are uncertain and difficult to predict.CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that are based on management’s current expectations, estimates, and projections. Words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,” “forecasts,” “could,” “may,” variations of these words, and similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. Certain factors, including but not limited to those identified under “Item 1A. Risk Factors
” of this Form 10-K, may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations, estimates, projections, forecasts, and from past results. No assurance can be made that any expectation, estimate, or projection contained in a forward-looking statement will be achieved or will not be affected by the factors cited above or other unknown or future events. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as the result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law"
7,ABT,ABBOTT LABORATORIES,2023-02-17,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSIn addition to the other information in this report, the following risk factors should be considered before deciding to invest in any of Abbott’s securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to Abbott, or risks Abbott currently considers immaterial, could also affect Abbott’s actual results. Abbott’s business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.Business and Operational RisksDisruptions to Abbott’s global supply chain, which is large and complex, could negatively affect Abbott’s results of operations.Abbott’s operations and performance depend on its ability to manage its large and complex global supply chain. The COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to global supply chain disruptions, which have adversely impacted the cost and availability of certain raw materials, supplies, and services. While Abbott has taken actions to offset some of these inflationary pressures in its supply chain, Abbott may not be able to completely offset all the increases in its operational costs. Further, Abbott has experienced, and may continue to experience, availability issues with some services, operations, and materials used in its products. To date, Abbott has been able to manage the various supply chain challenges without significant supply disruption or shortage for services, raw materials and supplies. The future extent to which supply chain disruptions may have a material effect on Abbott’s operating results is uncertain. A more detailed discussion on the supply chain disruptions impact on Abbott’s business is contained in the “Financial Review” section in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report.Abbott may acquire other businesses, license rights to technologies or products, form alliances, or dispose of or spin-off businesses, which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability.From time to time, Abbott pursues acquisitions, licensing arrangements, and strategic alliances, or dispose of or spin-off some of its businesses, as part of its business strategy. Abbott may not complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and may not realize the expected benefits. If Abbott is successful in making an acquisition, the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated. Abbott may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business or transition disposed businesses efficiently, and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities. Abbott could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or disposition-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of long-term assets. These effects could cause a deterioration of Abbott’s credit rating, result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense, and decrease liquidity.Abbott depends on sophisticated information technology systems and maintains protected personal data, and a cyber attack or other breach affecting these information technology systems or protected data could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s results of operations.Similar to other large multi-national companies, the size and complexity of the information technology systems on which Abbott relies for both its infrastructure and products make them susceptible to a cyber attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy, or other significant disruption. These systems have been and are expected to continue to be the target of malware and other cyber attacks. In addition, third party hacking attempts may cause Abbott’s information technology systems and related products, protected data, or proprietary information to be compromised or stolen. A significant attack or other disruption could result in adverse consequences, including increased costs and expenses, manufacturing challenges or disruption, problems with product availability, functionality or safety, damage to customer relations, reputational damage, lost revenue, and legal or regulatory penalties.Abbott also collects, manages and processes protected personal data, including protected health information, in connection with certain medical products and service offerings. Abbott is subject to certain regional and local data protection laws that prohibit or restrict the transfer of protected data across country borders. For additional information concerning data privacy and security regulation, see the discussion in “Regulation” under Item 1, “Business.” A breach of protected personal information could result in adverse consequences, including regulatory inquiries or litigation, increased costs and expenses, reputational damage, lost revenue, and fines or penalties.9Table of ContentsAbbott invests in its systems and technology and in the protection of its products and data to reduce the risk of an attack or other significant disruption, and monitors its systems on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats or vulnerabilities and for changes in technology and the regulatory environment. There can be no assurance that these measures and efforts will prevent future attacks or other significant disruptions to any of the systems on which Abbott relies or that related product issues will not arise in the future. Similarly, there can be no assurance that third party information technology providers or other partners with whom Abbott contracts will not suffer a significant attack or disruption that impacts customers like Abbott. Any significant breach, attack or other disruption involving Abbott’s systems or products could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s business.Abbott’s research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and technologies, which may cause Abbott’s revenue and profitability to decline.To remain competitive, Abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies. To accomplish this, Abbott commits substantial efforts, funds, and other resources to research and development. A risk of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies. Abbott must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including after significant funds have been invested.Promising new products and technologies may fail to reach the market or may only have limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, limited scope of approved uses, excessive costs to manufacture, failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights, or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others. Even if Abbott successfully develops new products or enhancements or new generations of Abbott’s existing products, they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences, changing industry or regulatory standards, or competitors’ innovations. Innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of, among other things, entrenched patterns of clinical practice or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Abbott cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched, whether it will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire compounds or products, or whether any products will be commercially successful. Failure to launch successful new products or technologies, or new indications or uses for existing products, may cause Abbott’s products or technologies to become obsolete, causing Abbott’s revenues and operating results to suffer.The manufacture of many of Abbott's products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if Abbott or one of its suppliers or manufacturers encounters problems manufacturing products, Abbott’s business could suffer.The manufacture of many of Abbott’s products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials or the global supply chain, failure to meet product specifications, cyber attacks, natural disasters, and environmental factors. In addition, single suppliers are currently used for certain products and materials. If problems arise during the production of a lot or batch of product, those products may have to be discarded. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred. Any of these events could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, reputational damage, time and expense spent investigating the cause and remediating the problem, if any, a production stoppage at a manufacturing facility, and depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other lots, batches or products. To the extent Abbott or one of its suppliers or manufacturers experiences significant manufacturing problems, this could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues and profitability.Abbott has significant indebtedness, which could adversely affect its business, including decreasing its business flexibility.As of December 31, 2022, Abbott's consolidated indebtedness was approximately $16.8 billion. This consolidated indebtedness could have the effect, among other things, of reducing Abbott's flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions, and reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes.Further, Abbott may be required to raise additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, future acquisitions or other general corporate purposes. Abbott's ability to arrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on, among other factors, Abbott's financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond Abbott's control. Consequently, Abbott cannot assure that it will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to Abbott or at all, which could adversely impact Abbott's ability to make scheduled payments with respect to its consolidated indebtedness and its profitability and financial condition.10Table of ContentsAdditionally, further borrowing could cause a deterioration of Abbott's credit ratings. Abbott's credit ratings reflect each credit rating agency's then opinion of Abbott's financial strength, operating performance, and ability to meet its debt obligations. Adverse changes in Abbott's credit ratings may result in increased borrowing costs for future long-term debt or short-term borrowing facilities and may limit financing options, including access to the unsecured borrowing market. Abbott may also be subject to additional restrictive covenants that would reduce flexibility.Legal and Regulatory RisksAbbott is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it is costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes.Abbott’s products are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous international, supranational, federal, and state authorities. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a drug, medical device, diagnostic product, or nutritional product can be costly and time-consuming, and approvals might not be granted for future products, or additional indications or uses of existing products, on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in the receipt of, or failure to obtain, approvals for future products, or new indications and uses, could result in delayed realization of product revenues, reduction in revenues, and substantial additional costs.In addition, no assurance can be given that Abbott will remain in compliance with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements once approval or marketing authorization has been obtained for a product. These requirements include, among other things, regulations regarding manufacturing practices, product labeling, and advertising and postmarketing reporting, including adverse event reports and field alerts. Many of Abbott’s facilities and procedures and those of Abbott’s suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation, including periodic inspection by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Abbott must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations. Possible regulatory actions for non-compliance include warning letters, fines, damages, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls, consent decrees, seizures of Abbott’s products, and criminal prosecution.These actions could result in, among other things, substantial modifications to Abbott’s business practices and operations; refunds, recalls, or seizures of Abbott’s products; a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more facilities while Abbott or Abbott’s suppliers remedy the alleged violation; the inability to obtain future pre-market approvals or marketing authorizations; and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market. Any of these events could disrupt Abbott’s business and have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues, profitability, cash flows, and financial condition. For information on Abbott’s voluntary recall in February 2022 of certain powder infant formula products manufactured at its facility in Sturgis, Michigan, the manufacturing stoppage at such facility, and the consent decree that Abbott entered into with the FDA on May 16, 2022, see the discussion in the “Financial Review” section in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report. Laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on Abbott, require Abbott to change its business practices, and restrict its operations.Abbott’s industry is subject to various international, supranational, federal, and state laws and regulations pertaining to government benefit program reimbursement, price reporting and regulation, and health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback and false claims laws, and international and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices. Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, substantial fines, imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in government health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and Veterans Administration health programs in the U.S. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to evolving interpretations, which could require Abbott to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt Abbott’s business and result in a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues, profitability, and financial condition.Changes in the health care regulatory environment may adversely impact the demand for and price of Abbott’s products.Both in the U.S. and internationally, government authorities may enact changes in regulatory requirements, make legislative or administrative reforms to existing reimbursement programs, make adverse decisions relating to Abbott’s products’ coverage or reimbursement, or make changes to patient access to health care, all of which could adversely impact the demand for and usage of Abbott’s products or the prices that Abbott’s customers are willing to pay for them.11Table of ContentsFurther, in the U.S., a number of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 address access to health care products and services. These provisions may be modified, expanded, repealed, or otherwise invalidated, in whole or in part. Future rulemaking could affect rebates, prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, or required reporting and disclosure. Abbott cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking or changes in the law.For additional information concerning health care regulation, see the discussion in “Regulation” under Item 1, “Business.”The expiration or loss of intellectual property protection and licenses may affect Abbott’s future revenues and operating income.Many of Abbott’s businesses rely on patent and trademark and other intellectual property protection. Although most of the challenges to Abbott’s intellectual property have come from other companies, governments may also challenge intellectual property protections. To the extent Abbott’s intellectual property is successfully challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or to the extent it does not allow Abbott to compete effectively, Abbott’s businesses could suffer. To the extent that countries do not enforce Abbott’s intellectual property rights, Abbott’s future revenues and operating income could be reduced. Any material litigation regarding Abbott’s patents and trademarks is described in the section captioned “Legal Proceedings.”Significant safety concerns could arise for Abbott’s products, which could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues and financial condition.Health care products typically receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration. Following regulatory approval, these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients. Investigators may also conduct additional, and perhaps more extensive, studies. When new safety concerns are reported, Abbott may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product. For example, Abbott may be required to provide additional warnings on a product’s label or narrow its approved intended use, either of which could reduce the product’s market acceptance. If serious safety concerns arise with an Abbott product, sales of the product have been and could be halted by Abbott or by regulatory authorities. Safety concerns affecting suppliers’ or competitors’ products also may reduce the market acceptance of Abbott’s products.In addition, in the ordinary course of business, Abbott is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that its products or the products of other companies that Abbott promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for, or injury to, patients. Product liability claims and lawsuits, safety alerts or product recalls, and other allegations of product safety or quality issues, regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome, may have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s business and reputation and on Abbott’s ability to attract and retain customers. Consequences may also include additional costs, a decrease in market share for the products, lower income or exposure to other claims. Product liability losses are self-insured and could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s profitability, cash flows, and financial condition.Economic and Industry RisksAbbott is subject to risks related to public health crises, such as widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases like the COVID-19 pandemic, which has had, and may continue to have, a material effect on Abbott’s business, financial condition and results of operations. As a global healthcare company, public health crises, such as the widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases like the COVID-19 pandemic, may negatively impact certain of Abbott's operations. Health concerns and significant changes in political or economic conditions caused by such outbreaks can cause, and during the COVID-19 pandemic have caused, significant reductions in demand for certain products, increased difficulty in serving customers, disruptions to manufacturing and supply chains, and negative effects on certain of Abbott’s operations as well as the operations of its suppliers, distributors and other third-party partners. Furthermore, such widespread outbreaks may impact, and during the COVID-19 pandemic have impacted, the broader economies of affected countries, including negatively impacting economic growth, the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, inflation rates (including in the U.S.), foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to global supply chain disruptions, which have adversely impacted the cost and availability of certain raw materials, supplies, and services. 12Table of ContentsWith regard to COVID-19 diagnostic testing, the FDA issued Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) for several COVID‑19 related products in 2020 and 2021, including Abbott diagnostic tests. EUAs are authorized pursuant to an EUA Declaration under the U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and remain in effect until the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services terminates the EUA Declaration or unless sooner terminated or revoked. Abbott is actively pursuing the FDA’s customary regulatory approval process for various COVID-19 diagnostic tests which has uncertainty as discussed in “Abbott is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes.” in “Legal and Regulatory Risks” under “Item 1A. Risk Factors
.” On January 30, 2023, the U.S. announced that it plans to end the public health emergency on May 11, 2023. Abbott is evaluating the potential impacts of the end of the public health emergency, and it will continue to monitor further regulatory actions from relevant U.S. government agencies and assess potential impacts on pandemic-related government policies and product authorizations. Further, the demand for COVID-19 tests has been volatile over the last two years as the number of COVID-19 cases has fluctuated during the period. Abbott expects the COVID-19 pandemic to shift to an endemic state in 2023, which would likely result in significantly lower demand for COVID-19 tests.Due to the unpredictability of the COVID-19 pandemic, including how and when it will shift to an endemic state, the extent to which COVID-19 will continue to have a material effect on Abbott’s business, financial condition or results of operations is uncertain. A more detailed discussion on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Abbott’s business is contained in the “Financial Review” section in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report.Abbott is subject to cost containment efforts that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operating income.In the United States and other countries, Abbott’s businesses have experienced downward pressure on certain product pricing. Cost containment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in the section captioned “Regulation.” To the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater patient access to health care or other factors, Abbott’s future revenues and operating income will be reduced.Competitors’ intellectual property may prevent Abbott from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s future profitability and financial condition.In the ordinary course of business, Abbott is the subject of patent litigation, such as competitor claims that an Abbott product infringes their intellectual property. Resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require Abbott to enter into license agreements. Abbott cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject Abbott to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture, sale or use of affected Abbott products. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s profitability and financial condition.New products and technological advances by Abbott’s competitors may negatively affect Abbott’s results of operations.Abbott’s products face intense competition from competitive products. Competitors’ products may be safer, more effective, more effectively marketed or sold, or have lower prices or superior performance features than Abbott’s products. Abbott cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction of competitors’ products.Fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates has adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect Abbott’s financial statements and its ability to realize projected sales and earnings.Although Abbott’s financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of Abbott’s revenues and costs are realized in other currencies. Sales outside of the United States in 2022 made up approximately 58 percent of Abbott’s net sales. Abbott’s profitability is affected by movement of the U.S. dollar against other currencies. Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies may also affect the reported value of Abbott’s assets and liabilities, as well as its cash flows. Some foreign currencies are subject to government exchange controls. While Abbott enters into hedging arrangements to mitigate some of its foreign currency exposure, Abbott cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or its ability to mitigate these risks.Information on the impact of foreign exchange rates on Abbott’s financial results is contained in the “Financial Review — Results of Operations” section in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report. A discussion of the steps taken to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange is contained in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in Abbott’s 2022 Form 10-K. Information on Abbott’s hedging arrangements is contained in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in this report.13Table of ContentsDeterioration in the economic condition and credit quality of certain countries may negatively affect Abbott’s results of operations.Unfavorable economic conditions in certain countries may increase the time it takes to collect outstanding trade receivables. Financial instability and fiscal deficits in these countries may result in additional austerity measures to reduce costs, including health care. Deterioration in the quality of sovereign debt, including credit downgrades, could increase Abbott’s collection risk where a significant amount of Abbott’s receivables in these countries are with governmental health care systems or where Abbott’s customers depend on payment by government health care systems.The international nature of Abbott’s business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause its revenue and profitability to decline.Abbott’s business is subject to risks associated with managing a global supply chain and doing business internationally. Sales outside of the United States in 2022 made up approximately 58 percent of Abbott’s net sales. Additional risks associated with Abbott’s international operations include:•differing local product preferences and product requirements;•trade protection measures, including tariffs, import or export licensing requirements, other governmental restrictions such as trade sanctions, and changes to international trade agreements;•difficulty in establishing, staffing, and managing operations;•differing labor regulations;•potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;•political and economic instability, including sovereign debt issues;•restrictions on local currency conversion and/or cash extraction;•price controls, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization, and other governmental action;•inflation, recession, and fluctuations in interest rates;•diminished protection of intellectual property; and•potential penalties or other adverse consequences for violations of anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and other similar laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act.Events contemplated by these risks may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues and profitability.Other factors can have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s future profitability and financial condition.Many other factors can affect Abbott’s profitability and its financial condition, including:•changes in or interpretations of laws and regulations, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements, product approval standards, product labeling standards, source and use laws, and environmental laws;•differences between the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and their actual value, particularly for pensions, retiree health care, stock compensation, intangibles, goodwill, and contingent consideration; and for contingent liabilities such as litigation, the absence of a recorded amount, or an amount recorded at the minimum, compared to the actual amount;•changes in the rate of inflation (including the cost of raw materials, commodities, and supplies), interest rates, market value of Abbott’s equity investments, and the performance of investments held by Abbott or Abbott’s employee benefit trusts;•changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties that transact business with or provide services to Abbott or Abbott’s employee benefit trusts;•changes in business, economic, and political conditions, including: war, political instability, terrorist attacks, the threat of future terrorist activity and related military action; global climate change, extreme weather and natural disasters; widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases; the cost and availability of insurance due to any of the foregoing events; labor disputes, strikes, slow-downs, or other forms of labor or union activity; and pressure from third-party interest groups;14Table of Contents•changes in Abbott’s business units and investments and changes in the relative and absolute contribution of each to earnings and cash flow resulting from evolving business strategies, changing product mix, changes in tax laws or tax rates both in the U.S. and abroad and opportunities existing now or in the future;•changes in the buying patterns of a major distributor, retailer, wholesaler, or other customer resulting from buyer purchasing decisions, pricing, seasonality, or other factors, or other problems with licensors, suppliers, distributors, and business partners; and•legal difficulties, any of which could preclude or delay commercialization of products or adversely affect profitability, including claims asserting statutory or regulatory violations, and adverse litigation decisions.Many of these factors may manifest individually or collectively, such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine which resulted in political instability, sanctions, economic and currency volatility, inflation and other operational and supply disruptions. To date, Abbott has been able to manage these disruptions without material impact to its results of operations. However, it is difficult to predict the future implications and consequences of the situation on local, regional or global economies and Abbott’s operations. There could be additional sanctions, economic volatility, cybersecurity threats, political instability, transportation and other supply disruptions, as well as collection default risk or limited availability of resources to conduct essential business processes that could have a material adverse impact to Abbott’s operations and financial condition. The resolution and long-term impact of this matter are uncertain and difficult to predict.CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that are based on management’s current expectations, estimates, and projections. Words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “intends,” “plans,” “believes,” “seeks,” “estimates,” “forecasts,” variations of these words, and similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. Certain factors, including but not limited to those identified under “Item 1A. Risk Factors
” of this Form 10-K, may cause actual results to differ materially from current expectations, estimates, projections, forecasts, and from past results. No assurance can be made that any expectation, estimate, or projection contained in a forward-looking statement will be achieved or will not be affected by the factors cited above or other unknown or future events. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as the result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law"
5,ABT,ABBOTT LABORATORIES,2022-02-18,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSIn addition to the other information in this report, the following risk factors should be considered before deciding to invest in any of Abbott’s securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to Abbott, or risks Abbott currently considers immaterial, could also affect Abbott’s actual results. Abbott’s business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.Business and Operational RisksAbbott may acquire other businesses, license rights to technologies or products, form alliances, or dispose of or spin-off businesses, which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability.Abbott may pursue acquisitions, licensing arrangements, and strategic alliances, or dispose of or spin-off some of its businesses, as part of its business strategy. Abbott may not complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and may not realize the expected benefits. If Abbott is successful in making an acquisition, the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated. Abbott may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business or transition disposed businesses efficiently, and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities. Abbott could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or disposition-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of long-term assets. These effects could cause a deterioration of Abbott’s credit rating, result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense, and decrease liquidity.Abbott depends on sophisticated information technology systems and maintains protected personal data, and a cyber attack or other breach affecting these information technology systems or protected data could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s results of operations.Similar to other large multi-national companies, the size and complexity of the information technology systems on which Abbott relies for both its infrastructure and products makes them susceptible to a cyber attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy, or other significant disruption. These systems have been and are expected to continue to be the target of malware and other cyber attacks. In addition, third party hacking attempts may cause Abbott’s information technology systems and related products, protected data, or proprietary information to be compromised or stolen. A significant attack or other disruption could result in adverse consequences, including increased costs and expenses, manufacturing challenges or disruption, problems with product functionality, damage to customer relations, reputational damage, lost revenue, and legal or regulatory penalties.Abbott also collects, manages and processes protected personal data, including protected health information, in connection with certain medical products and service offerings. Abbott is subject to certain regional and local data protection laws that prohibit or restrict the transfer of protected data across country borders. For additional information concerning data privacy and security regulation, see the discussion in “Regulation” under Item 1, “Business.” A breach of protected personal information could result in adverse consequences, including regulatory inquiries or litigation, increased costs and expenses, reputational damage, lost revenue, and fines or penalties.Abbott invests in its systems and technology and in the protection of its products and data to reduce the risk of an attack or other significant disruption, and monitors its systems on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats or vulnerabilities and for changes in technology and the regulatory environment. There can be no assurance that these measures and efforts will prevent future attacks or other significant disruptions to any of the systems on which Abbott relies or that related product issues will not arise in the future. Similarly, there can be no assurance that third party information technology providers with whom Abbott contracts will not suffer a significant attack or disruption that impacts customers like Abbott. Any significant breach, attack or other disruption involving Abbott’s systems or products could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s business.9Abbott’s research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and technologies, which may cause Abbott’s revenue and profitability to decline.To remain competitive, Abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies. To accomplish this, Abbott commits substantial efforts, funds, and other resources to research and development. A risk of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies. Abbott must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including after significant funds have been invested.Promising new products and technologies may fail to reach the market or may only have limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, limited scope of approved uses, excessive costs to manufacture, failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights, or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others. Even if Abbott successfully develops new products or enhancements or new generations of Abbott’s existing products, they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences, changing industry or regulatory standards, or competitors’ innovations. Innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of, among other things, entrenched patterns of clinical practice or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Abbott cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched, whether it will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire compounds or products, or whether any products will be commercially successful. Failure to launch successful new products or technologies, or new indications or uses for existing products, may cause Abbott’s products or technologies to become obsolete, causing Abbott’s revenues and operating results to suffer.The manufacture of many of Abbott’s products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if Abbott or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing products, Abbott’s business could suffer.The manufacture of many of Abbott’s products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials or the global supply chain, cyber attacks, natural disasters, and environmental factors. In addition, single suppliers are currently used for certain products and materials. If problems arise during the production of a lot or batch of product, those products may have to be discarded. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred. Any of these events could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other lots, batches or products. To the extent Abbott or one of its suppliers experiences significant manufacturing problems, this could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues and profitability.Abbott has significant indebtedness, which could adversely affect its business, including decreasing its business flexibility.As of December 31, 2021, Abbott's consolidated indebtedness was approximately $18.1 billion. This consolidated indebtedness could have the effect, among other things, of reducing Abbott's flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions, and reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes.Further, Abbott may be required to raise additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, future acquisitions or other general corporate purposes. Abbott's ability to arrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on, among other factors, Abbott's financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond Abbott's control. Consequently, Abbott cannot assure that it will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to Abbott or at all, which could adversely impact Abbott's ability to make scheduled payments with respect to its consolidated indebtedness and its profitability and financial condition.Additionally, further borrowing could cause a deterioration of Abbott's credit ratings. Abbott's credit ratings reflect each credit rating agency's then opinion of Abbott's financial strength, operating performance, and ability to meet its debt obligations. Adverse changes in Abbott's credit ratings may result in increased borrowing costs for future long-term debt or short-term borrowing facilities and may limit financing options, including access to the unsecured borrowing market. Abbott may also be subject to additional restrictive covenants that would reduce flexibility.10Legal and Regulatory RisksAbbott is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes.Abbott’s products are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous international, supranational, federal, and state authorities. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a drug, medical device, diagnostic product, or nutritional product can be costly and time-consuming, and approvals might not be granted for future products, or additional indications or uses of existing products, on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in the receipt of, or failure to obtain, approvals for future products, or new indications and uses, could result in delayed realization of product revenues, reduction in revenues, and substantial additional costs.In addition, no assurance can be given that Abbott will remain in compliance with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements once approval or marketing authorization has been obtained for a product. These requirements include, among other things, regulations regarding manufacturing practices, product labeling, and advertising and postmarketing reporting, including adverse event reports and field alerts. Many of Abbott’s facilities and procedures and those of Abbott’s suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation, including periodic inspection by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Abbott must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations. Possible regulatory actions for non-compliance could include warning letters, fines, damages, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls, seizures of Abbott’s products, and criminal prosecution.These actions could result in, among other things, substantial modifications to Abbott’s business practices and operations; refunds, recalls, or seizures of Abbott’s products; a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more facilities while Abbott or Abbott’s suppliers remedy the alleged violation; the inability to obtain future pre-market approvals or marketing authorizations; and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market. Any of these events could disrupt Abbott’s business and have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues, profitability and financial condition.Laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on Abbott, require Abbott to change its business practices, and restrict its operations in the future.Abbott’s industry is subject to various international, supranational, federal, and state laws and regulations pertaining to government benefit program reimbursement, price reporting and regulation, and health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback and false claims laws, and international and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices. Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, substantial fines, imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in government health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and Veterans Administration health programs in the U.S. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to evolving interpretations, which could require Abbott to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt Abbott’s business and result in a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues, profitability, and financial condition.Changes in the health care regulatory environment may adversely affect Abbott’s business.Both in the U.S. and internationally, government authorities may enact changes in regulatory requirements, make legislative or administrative reforms to existing reimbursement programs, make adverse decisions relating to Abbott’s products’ coverage or reimbursement, or make changes to patient access to health care, all of which could adversely impact the demand for and usage of Abbott’s products or the prices that Abbott’s customers are willing to pay for them.Further, in the U.S., a number of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 address access to health care products and services. These provisions may be modified, expanded, repealed, or otherwise invalidated, in whole or in part. Future rulemaking could affect rebates, prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, or required reporting and disclosure. Abbott cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking or changes in the law.For additional information concerning health care regulation, see the discussion in “Regulation” under Item 1, “Business.”The expiration or loss of intellectual property protection and licenses may affect Abbott’s future revenues and operating income.Many of Abbott’s businesses rely on patent and trademark and other intellectual property protection. Although most of the challenges to Abbott’s intellectual property have come from other companies, governments may also challenge intellectual property protections. To the extent Abbott’s intellectual property is successfully challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or to the extent it does not allow Abbott to compete effectively, Abbott’s businesses could suffer. To the extent that countries do not enforce Abbott’s intellectual property rights, Abbott’s future revenues and operating income could be reduced. Any material litigation regarding Abbott’s patents and trademarks is described in the section captioned “Legal Proceedings.”11Significant safety concerns could arise for Abbott’s products, which could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues and financial condition.Health care products typically receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration. Following regulatory approval, these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients. Investigators may also conduct additional, and perhaps more extensive, studies. If new safety issues are reported, Abbott may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product. For example, Abbott may be required to provide additional warnings on a product’s label or narrow its approved intended use, either of which could reduce the product’s market acceptance. If serious safety issues arise with an Abbott product, sales of the product could be halted by Abbott or by regulatory authorities. Safety issues affecting suppliers’ or competitors’ products also may reduce the market acceptance of Abbott’s products.In addition, in the ordinary course of business, Abbott is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that its products or the products of other companies that Abbott promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for, or injury to, patients. Product liability claims and lawsuits, safety alerts or product recalls, and other allegations of product safety or quality issues, regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome, may have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s business and reputation and on Abbott’s ability to attract and retain customers. Consequences may also include additional costs, a decrease in market share for the products, lower income or exposure to other claims. Product liability losses are self-insured. Product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s profitability and financial condition.Economic and Industry RisksAbbott is subject to risks related to public health crises, such as widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases like the COVID-19 pandemic. As a global healthcare company, public health crises, such as the widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases like the COVID-19 pandemic, may negatively impact Abbott's operations. Health concerns and significant changes in political or economic conditions caused by such outbreaks can cause significant reductions in demand for certain products, increased difficulty in serving customers, disrupt manufacturing and supply chains, and negatively affect Abbott’s operations as well as the operations of its suppliers, distributors and other third-party partners. Furthermore, such widespread outbreaks may impact the broader economies of affected countries, including negatively impacting economic growth, the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates.  To date, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected Abbott's diversified health care business in various ways, with some businesses performing at the levels required to successfully meet new demands, other having faced challenges during periods when the number of COVID-19 cases significantly increased, and still others being relatively less impacted by the pandemic.With regard to COVID-19 diagnostic testing, the FDA issued Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) for several COVID-19 related products in 2020 and 2021, including Abbott diagnostic tests. EUAs are authorized for the duration of the COVID-19 public health emergency unless sooner terminated or revoked. Abbott is actively pursuing the FDA’s customary regulatory approval process for various COVID-19 diagnostic tests which has uncertainty as discussed in “Abbott is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes.” in “Legal and Regulatory Risks” under “Item 1A. Risk Factors
.” Further, the demand for COVID-19 tests has been, and Abbott expects it to continue to be, highly volatile, primarily driven by the emergence and severity of new variants, which are unpredictable.In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to global supply chain disruptions, which has adversely impacted the cost and availability of certain raw materials, supplies, and services. While Abbott has taken actions to offset some of these inflationary pressures in its supply chain, Abbott may not be able to completely offset all the increases in its operational costs. Further, Abbott has experienced, and may continue to experience, availability issues with some services and materials used in its products. To date, Abbott has been able to manage these challenges without significant supply disruption or shortage for services, raw materials and supplies, however, no assurance can be given that these efforts will continue to be successful. Significant disruptions or shortages may result in Abbott’s inability to meet customer demand for certain of its products.Due to the unpredictability of the duration and impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will have a material effect on Abbott’s business, financial condition or results of operations is uncertain. A more detailed discussion on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Abbott’s business is contained in the “Financial Review” section in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report.12Abbott is subject to cost containment efforts that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operating income.In the United States and other countries, Abbott’s businesses have experienced downward pressure on product pricing. Cost containment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in the section captioned “Regulation.” To the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater patient access to health care or other factors, Abbott’s future revenues and operating income will be reduced.Competitors’ intellectual property may prevent Abbott from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s future profitability and financial condition.In the ordinary course of business, Abbott is the subject of patent litigation, such as competitor claims that an Abbott product infringes their intellectual property. Resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require Abbott to enter into license agreements. Abbott cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject Abbott to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture, sale or use of affected Abbott products. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s profitability and financial condition.New products and technological advances by Abbott’s competitors may negatively affect Abbott’s results of operations.Abbott’s products face intense competition from competitive products. Competitors’ products may be safer, more effective, more effectively marketed or sold, or have lower prices or superior performance features than Abbott’s products. Abbott cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction of competitors’ products.Fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect Abbott’s financial statements and its ability to realize projected sales and earnings.Although Abbott’s financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of Abbott’s revenues and costs are realized in other currencies. Sales outside of the United States in 2021 made up approximately 61 percent of Abbott’s net sales. Abbott’s profitability is affected by movement of the U.S. dollar against other currencies. Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies may also affect the reported value of Abbott’s assets and liabilities, as well as its cash flows. Some foreign currencies are subject to government exchange controls. While Abbott enters into hedging arrangements to mitigate some of its foreign currency exposure, Abbott cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or its ability to mitigate these risks.Information on the impact of foreign exchange rates on Abbott’s financial results is contained in the “Financial Review — Results of Operations” section in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report. A discussion of the steps taken to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange is contained in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in Abbott’s 2021 Form 10-K. Information on Abbott’s hedging arrangements is contained in Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements in this report.Deterioration in the economic condition and credit quality of certain countries may negatively affect Abbott’s results of operations.Unfavorable economic conditions in certain countries may increase the time it takes to collect outstanding trade receivables. Financial instability and fiscal deficits in these countries may result in additional austerity measures to reduce costs, including health care. Deterioration in the quality of sovereign debt, including credit downgrades, could increase Abbott’s collection risk where a significant amount of Abbott’s receivables in these countries are with governmental health care systems or where Abbott’s customers depend on payment by government health care systems.The international nature of Abbott’s business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause its revenue and profitability to decline.Abbott’s business is subject to risks associated with managing a global supply chain and doing business internationally. Sales outside of the United States in 2021 made up approximately 61 percent of Abbott’s net sales. Additional risks associated with Abbott’s international operations include:●differing local product preferences and product requirements;●trade protection measures, including tariffs, import or export licensing requirements, other governmental restrictions, and changes to international trade agreements;●difficulty in establishing, staffing, and managing operations;13●differing labor regulations;●potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;●political and economic instability, including sovereign debt issues;●restrictions on local currency conversion and/or cash extraction;●price controls, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization, and other governmental action;●inflation, recession, and fluctuations in interest rates;●diminished protection of intellectual property; and●potential penalties or other adverse consequences for violations of anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and other similar laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act.Events contemplated by these risks may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues and profitability.Other factors can have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s future profitability and financial condition.Many other factors can affect Abbott’s profitability and its financial condition, including:●changes in or interpretations of laws and regulations, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements, product marketing application standards, product labeling standards, source and use laws, and environmental laws;●differences between the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and their actual value, particularly for pensions, retiree health care, stock compensation, intangibles, goodwill, and contingent consideration; and for contingent liabilities such as litigation, the absence of a recorded amount, or an amount recorded at the minimum, compared to the actual amount;●changes in the rate of inflation (including the cost of raw materials, commodities, and supplies), interest rates, market value of Abbott’s equity investments, and the performance of investments held by Abbott or Abbott’s employee benefit trusts;●changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties that transact business with or provide services to Abbott or Abbott’s employee benefit trusts;●changes in business, economic, and political conditions, including: war, political instability, terrorist attacks, the threat of future terrorist activity and related military action; global climate change, extreme weather and natural disasters; the cost and availability of insurance due to any of the foregoing events; labor disputes, strikes, slow-downs, or other forms of labor or union activity; and pressure from third-party interest groups;●changes in Abbott’s business units and investments and changes in the relative and absolute contribution of each to earnings and cash flow resulting from evolving business strategies, changing product mix, changes in tax laws or tax rates both in the U.S. and abroad and opportunities existing now or in the future;●changes in the buying patterns of a major distributor, retailer,wholesaler, or other customer resulting from buyer purchasing decisions, pricing, seasonality, or other factors, or other problems with licensors, suppliers, distributors, and business partners; and●legal difficulties, any of which could preclude or delay commercialization of products or adversely affect profitability, including claims asserting statutory or regulatory violations, and adverse litigation decisions.​​14CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that are based on management’s current expectations, estimates, and projections.

14,ABT,ABBOTT LABORATORIES,2021-02-19,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSIn addition to the other information in this report, the following risk factors should be considered before deciding to invest in any of Abbott’s securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to Abbott, or risks Abbott currently considers immaterial, could also affect Abbott’s actual results. Abbott’s business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.Business and Operational RisksAbbott may acquire other businesses, license rights to technologies or products, form alliances, or dispose of or spin-off businesses, which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability.Abbott may pursue acquisitions, licensing arrangements, and strategic alliances, or dispose of or spin-off some of its businesses, as part of its business strategy. Abbott may not complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and may not realize the expected benefits. If Abbott is successful in making an acquisition, the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated. Abbott may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business or transition disposed businesses efficiently, and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities. Abbott could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or disposition-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of long-term assets. These effects could cause a deterioration of Abbott’s credit rating, result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense, and decrease liquidity.Abbott depends on sophisticated information technology systems and maintains protected personal data, and a cyber attack or other breach affecting these information technology systems or protected data could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s results of operations.Similar to other large multi-national companies, the size and complexity of the information technology systems on which Abbott relies for both its infrastructure and products makes them susceptible to a cyber attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy, or other significant disruption. These systems have been and are expected to continue to be the target of malware and other cyber attacks. In addition, third party hacking attempts may cause Abbott’s information technology systems and related products, protected data, or proprietary information to be compromised or stolen. A significant attack or other disruption could result in adverse consequences, including increased costs and expenses, manufacturing challenges or disruption, problems with product functionality, damage to customer relations, lost revenue, and legal or regulatory penalties.Abbott also collects, manages and processes protected personal data, including protected health information, in connection with certain medical products and service offerings. Abbott is subject to certain regional and local data protection laws that prohibit or restrict the transfer of protected data across country borders. For additional information concerning data privacy and security regulation, see the discussion in “Regulation” under Item 1, “Business.” A breach of protected personal information could result in adverse consequences, including regulatory inquiries or litigation, increased costs and expenses, reputational damage, lost revenue, and fines or penalties.Abbott invests in its systems and technology and in the protection of its products and data to reduce the risk of an attack or other significant disruption, and monitors its systems on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats and for changes in technology and the regulatory environment. There can be no assurance that these measures and efforts will prevent future attacks or other significant disruptions to any of the systems on which Abbott relies or that related product issues will not arise in the future. Similarly, there can be no assurance that third party information technology providers with whom Abbott contracts will not suffer a significant attack or disruption that impacts customers like Abbott. Any significant breach, attack or other disruption involving Abbott’s systems or products could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s business.9Abbott’s research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and technologies, which may cause Abbott’s revenue and profitability to decline.To remain competitive, Abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies. To accomplish this, Abbott commits substantial efforts, funds, and other resources to research and development. A risk of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies. Abbott must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including after significant funds have been invested.Promising new products and technologies may fail to reach the market or may only have limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, limited scope of approved uses, excessive costs to manufacture, failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights, or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others. Even if Abbott successfully develops new products or enhancements or new generations of Abbott’s existing products, they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences, changing industry or regulatory standards, or competitors’ innovations. Innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of, among other things, entrenched patterns of clinical practice or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Abbott cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched, whether it will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire compounds or products, or whether any products will be commercially successful. Failure to launch successful new products or technologies, or new indications or uses for existing products, may cause Abbott’s products or technologies to become obsolete, causing Abbott’s revenues and operating results to suffer.The manufacture of many of Abbott’s products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if Abbott or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing products, Abbott’s business could suffer.The manufacture of many of Abbott’s products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, natural disasters, and environmental factors. In addition, single suppliers are currently used for certain products and materials. If problems arise during the production of a lot or batch of product, those products may have to be discarded. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred. Any of these events could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other lots, batches or products. To the extent Abbott or one of its suppliers experiences significant manufacturing problems, this could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues and profitability.Abbott has significant indebtedness, which could adversely affect its business, including decreasing its business flexibility.As of December 31, 2020, Abbott's consolidated indebtedness was approximately $18.7 billion. This consolidated indebtedness could have the effect, among other things, of reducing Abbott's flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions, and reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes.Further, Abbott may be required to raise additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, future acquisitions or other general corporate purposes. Abbott's ability to arrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on, among other factors, Abbott's financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond Abbott's control. Consequently, Abbott cannot assure that it will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to Abbott or at all, which could adversely impact Abbott's ability to make scheduled payments with respect to its consolidated indebtedness and its profitability and financial condition.Additionally, further borrowing could cause a deterioration of Abbott's credit ratings. Abbott's credit ratings reflect each credit rating agency's then opinion of Abbott's financial strength, operating performance, and ability to meet its debt obligations. Adverse changes in Abbott's credit ratings may result in increased borrowing costs for future long-term debt or short-term borrowing facilities and may limit financing options, including access to the unsecured borrowing market. Abbott may also be subject to additional restrictive covenants that would reduce flexibility.10Legal and Regulatory RisksAbbott is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes.Abbott’s products are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous international, supranational, federal, and state authorities. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a drug, medical device, or diagnostic product can be costly and time-consuming, and approvals might not be granted for future products, or additional indications or uses of existing products, on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in the receipt of, or failure to obtain, approvals for future products, or new indications and uses, could result in delayed realization of product revenues, reduction in revenues, and substantial additional costs.In addition, no assurance can be given that Abbott will remain in compliance with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements once approval or marketing authorization has been obtained for a product. These requirements include, among other things, regulations regarding manufacturing practices, product labeling, and advertising and postmarketing reporting, including adverse event reports and field alerts. Many of Abbott’s facilities and procedures and those of Abbott’s suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation, including periodic inspection by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Abbott must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations. Possible regulatory actions for non-compliance could include warning letters, fines, damages, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls, seizures of Abbott’s products, and criminal prosecution.These actions could result in, among other things, substantial modifications to Abbott’s business practices and operations; refunds, recalls, or seizures of Abbott’s products; a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more facilities while Abbott or Abbott’s suppliers remedy the alleged violation; the inability to obtain future pre-market approvals or marketing authorizations; and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market. Any of these events could disrupt Abbott’s business and have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues, profitability and financial condition.Laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on Abbott, require Abbott to change its business practices, and restrict its operations in the future.Abbott’s industry is subject to various international, supranational, federal, and state laws and regulations pertaining to government benefit program reimbursement, price reporting and regulation, and health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback and false claims laws, and international and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices. Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, substantial fines, imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in government health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and Veterans Administration health programs in the U.S. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to evolving interpretations, which could require Abbott to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt Abbott’s business and result in a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues, profitability, and financial condition.Changes in the health care regulatory environment may adversely affect Abbott’s business.Both in the U.S. and internationally, government authorities may enact changes in regulatory requirements, make legislative or administrative reforms to existing reimbursement programs, make adverse decisions relating to Abbott’s products’ coverage or reimbursement, or make changes to patient access to health care, all of which could adversely impact the demand for and usage of Abbott’s products or the prices that Abbott’s customers are willing to pay for them.Further, in the U.S., a number of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 address access to health care products and services. These provisions may be modified, expanded, repealed, or otherwise invalidated, in whole or in part. Future rulemaking could affect rebates, prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, or required reporting and disclosure. Abbott cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking or changes in the law.For additional information concerning health care regulation, see the discussion in “Regulation” under Item 1, “Business.”11The expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may affect Abbott’s future revenues and operating income.Many of Abbott’s businesses rely on patent and trademark and other intellectual property protection. Although most of the challenges to Abbott’s intellectual property have come from other companies, governments may also challenge intellectual property protections. To the extent Abbott’s intellectual property is successfully challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or to the extent it does not allow Abbott to compete effectively, Abbott’s businesses could suffer. To the extent that countries do not enforce Abbott’s intellectual property rights, Abbott’s future revenues and operating income could be reduced. Any material litigation regarding Abbott’s patents and trademarks is described in the section captioned “Legal Proceedings.”Significant safety concerns could arise for Abbott’s products, which could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues and financial condition.Health care products typically receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration. Following regulatory approval, these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients. Investigators may also conduct additional, and perhaps more extensive, studies. If new safety issues are reported, Abbott may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product. For example, Abbott may be required to provide additional warnings on a product’s label or narrow its approved intended use, either of which could reduce the product’s market acceptance. If serious safety issues arise with an Abbott product, sales of the product could be halted by Abbott or by regulatory authorities. Safety issues affecting suppliers’ or competitors’ products also may reduce the market acceptance of Abbott’s products.In addition, in the ordinary course of business, Abbott is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that its products or the products of other companies that Abbott promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for, or injury to, patients. Product liability claims and lawsuits, safety alerts or product recalls, and other allegations of product safety or quality issues, regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome, may have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s business and reputation and on Abbott’s ability to attract and retain customers. Consequences may also include additional costs, a decrease in market share for the products, lower income or exposure to other claims. Product liability losses are self-insured. Product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s profitability and financial condition.Economic and Industry RisksAbbott is subject to risks related to public health crises, such as widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases like the COVID-19 pandemic. As a global healthcare company, public health crises, such as the widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases like the COVID-19 pandemic, may negatively impact Abbott's operations. Health concerns and significant changes in political or economic conditions caused by such outbreaks can cause significant reductions in demand for routine diagnostic testing and medical device procedures or increased difficulty in serving customers, disrupt manufacturing and supply chains, and negatively affect our operations as well as the operations of our suppliers, distributors and other third-party partners. Furthermore, such widespread outbreaks may impact the broader economies of affected countries, including negatively impacting economic growth, the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. With regard to the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA issued Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) for several COVID-19 related products in 2020, including Abbott diagnostic tests. EUAs are authorized for the duration of the COVID-19 public health emergency unless sooner terminated or revoked. Abbott is actively pursuing the FDA’s customary regulatory approval process for these diagnostic tests which has uncertainty as discussed in “Abbott is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes.” in “Legal and Regulatory Risks” under “Item 1A. Risk Factors
.” Due to the unpredictability of the duration and impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will have a material effect on Abbott’s business, financial condition or results of operations is uncertain. A more detailed discussion on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Abbott’s business is contained in the “Financial Review” section in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report.12Abbott is subject to cost containment efforts that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operating income.In the United States and other countries, Abbott’s businesses have experienced downward pressure on product pricing. Cost containment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in the section captioned “Regulation.” To the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater patient access to health care or other factors, Abbott’s future revenues and operating income will be reduced.Competitors’ intellectual property may prevent Abbott from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s future profitability and financial condition.Competitors may claim that an Abbott product infringes their intellectual property. Resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require Abbott to enter into license agreements. Abbott cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject Abbott to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture, sale or use of affected Abbott products. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s profitability and financial condition.New products and technological advances by Abbott’s competitors may negatively affect Abbott’s results of operations.Abbott’s products face intense competition from competitive products. Competitors’ products may be safer, more effective, more effectively marketed or sold, or have lower prices or superior performance features than Abbott’s products.  Abbott cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction of competitors’ products.Fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial statements and Abbott’s ability to realize projected sales and earnings.Although Abbott’s financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of Abbott’s revenues and costs are realized in other currencies. Sales outside of the United States in 2020 made up approximately 62 percent of Abbott’s net sales. Abbott’s profitability is affected by movement of the U.S. dollar against other currencies. Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies may also affect the reported value of Abbott’s assets and liabilities, as well as its cash flows. Some foreign currencies are subject to government exchange controls. While Abbott enters into hedging arrangements to mitigate some of its foreign currency exposure, Abbott cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or its ability to mitigate these risks.Information on the impact of foreign exchange rates on Abbott’s financial results is contained in the “Financial Review — Results of Operations” section in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report. A discussion of the steps taken to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange is contained in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in Abbott’s 2020 Form 10-K. Information on Abbott’s hedging arrangements is contained in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements in this report.Deterioration in the economic condition and credit quality of certain countries may negatively affect Abbott’s results of operations.Unfavorable economic conditions in certain countries may increase the time it takes to collect outstanding trade receivables. Financial instability and fiscal deficits in these countries may result in additional austerity measures to reduce costs, including health care. Deterioration in the quality of sovereign debt, including credit downgrades, could increase Abbott’s collection risk where a significant amount of Abbott’s receivables in these countries are with governmental health care systems or where Abbott’s customers depend on payment by government health care systems.The international nature of Abbott’s business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause its revenue and profitability to decline.Abbott’s business is subject to risks associated with managing a global supply chain and doing business internationally.

1,ABT,ABBOTT LABORATORIES,2020-02-21,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSIn addition to the other information in this report, the following risk factors should be considered before deciding to invest in any of Abbott’s securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to Abbott, or risks Abbott currently considers immaterial, could also affect Abbott’s actual results. Abbott’s business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.Abbott may acquire other businesses, license rights to technologies or products, form alliances, or dispose of or spin-off businesses, which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability.Abbott may pursue acquisitions, licensing arrangements, and strategic alliances, or dispose of or spin-off some of its businesses, as part of its business strategy.

Any of these events could disrupt Abbott’s business and have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues, profitability and financial condition.8Laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on Abbott, require Abbott to change its business practices, and restrict its operations in the future.Abbott’s industry is subject to various international, supranational, federal, and state laws and regulations pertaining to government benefit program reimbursement, price reporting and regulation, and health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback and false claims laws, and international and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices. Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, substantial fines, imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in government health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and Veterans Administration health programs in the U.S. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and they are subject to evolving interpretations, which could require Abbott to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt Abbott’s business and result in a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues, profitability, and financial condition.Changes in the health care regulatory environment may adversely affect Abbott’s business.Both in the U.S. and internationally, government authorities may enact changes in regulatory requirements, make legislative or administrative reforms to existing reimbursement programs, make adverse decisions relating to our products’ coverage or reimbursement, or make changes to patient access to health care, all of which could adversely impact the demand for and usage of Abbott’s products or the prices that Abbott’s customers are willing to pay for them.Further, in the U.S., a number of the provisions of the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 address access to health care products and services. These provisions may be modified, repealed, or otherwise invalidated, in whole or in part. Future rulemaking could affect rebates, prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, or required reporting and disclosure. Abbott cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking or changes in the law.For additional information concerning health care regulation, see the discussion in “Regulation” under Item 1, “Business.”Abbott depends on sophisticated information technology systems and maintains protected personal data, and a cyber attack or other breach affecting these information technology systems or protected data could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s results of operations.Similar to other large multi-national companies, the size and complexity of the information technology systems on which Abbott relies for both its infrastructure and products makes them susceptible to a cyber attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy, or other significant disruption. These systems have been and are expected to continue to be the target of malware and other cyber attacks. In addition, third party hacking attempts may cause Abbott’s information technology systems and related products, protected data, or proprietary information to be compromised or stolen. A significant attack or other disruption could result in adverse consequences, including increased costs and expenses, problems with product functionality, damage to customer relations, lost revenue, and legal or regulatory penalties.Abbott also collects, manages and processes protected personal data, including protected health information, in connection with certain medical products and service offerings. Abbott is subject to certain regional and local data protection laws that prohibit or restrict the transfer of protected data across country borders. For additional information concerning data privacy and security regulation, see the discussion in “Regulation” under Item 1, “Business.” A breach of protected personal information could result in adverse consequences, including regulatory inquiries or litigation, increased costs and expenses, reputational damage, lost revenue, and fines or penalties.Abbott invests in its systems and technology and in the protection of its products and data to reduce the risk of an attack or other significant disruption, and monitors its systems on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats and for changes in technology and the regulatory environment. There can be no assurance that these measures and efforts will prevent future attacks or other significant disruptions to any of the systems on which Abbott relies or that related product issues will not arise in the future. Any significant attack or other disruption on Abbott’s systems or products could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s business.9Abbott has significant indebtedness, which could adversely affect its business, including decreasing its business flexibility.As of December 31, 2019, Abbott's consolidated indebtedness was approximately $18 billion. This consolidated indebtedness could have the effect, among other things, of reducing Abbott's flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions, and reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes.Further, Abbott may be required to raise additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, future acquisitions or other general corporate purposes. Abbott's ability to arrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on, among other factors, Abbott's financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond Abbott's control. Consequently, Abbott cannot assure that it will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to Abbott or at all, which could adversely impact Abbott's ability to make scheduled payments with respect to its consolidated indebtedness and its profitability and financial condition.Additionally, further borrowing could cause a deterioration of Abbott's credit ratings. Abbott's credit ratings reflect each credit rating agency's then opinion of Abbott's financial strength, operating performance, and ability to meet its debt obligations. Adverse changes in Abbott's credit ratings may result in increased borrowing costs for future long-term debt or short-term borrowing facilities and may limit financing options, including access to the unsecured borrowing market. Abbott may also be subject to additional restrictive covenants that would reduce flexibility.The expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may affect Abbott’s future revenues and operating income.Many of Abbott’s businesses rely on patent and trademark and other intellectual property protection. Although most of the challenges to Abbott’s intellectual property have come from other companies, governments may also challenge intellectual property protections. To the extent Abbott’s intellectual property is successfully challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or to the extent it does not allow Abbott to compete effectively, Abbott’s businesses could suffer. To the extent that countries do not enforce Abbott’s intellectual property rights, Abbott’s future revenues and operating income could be reduced. Any material litigation regarding Abbott’s patents and trademarks is described in the section captioned “Legal Proceedings.”Competitors’ intellectual property may prevent Abbott from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s future profitability and financial condition.Competitors may claim that an Abbott product infringes their intellectual property. Resolving an intellectual property infringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require Abbott to enter into license agreements. Abbott cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject Abbott to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture, sale or use of affected Abbott products. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s profitability and financial condition.Abbott’s research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and technologies, which may cause Abbott’s revenue and profitability to decline.To remain competitive, Abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies. To accomplish this, Abbott commits substantial efforts, funds, and other resources to research and development. A risk of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies. Abbott must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including after significant funds have been invested.Promising new products and technologies may fail to reach the market or may only have limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, limited scope of approved uses, excessive costs to manufacture, failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights, or infringement of the intellectual property rights of others. Even if Abbott successfully develops new products or enhancements or new generations of Abbott’s existing products, they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences, changing industry or regulatory standards, or competitors’ innovations. Innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of, among other things, entrenched patterns of clinical practice or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Abbott cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under 10development will be launched, whether it will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire compounds or products, or whether any products will be commercially successful. Failure to launch successful new products or technologies, or new indications or uses for existing products, may cause Abbott’s products or technologies to become obsolete, causing Abbott’s revenues and operating results to suffer.New products and technological advances by Abbott’s competitors may negatively affect Abbott’s results of operations.Abbott’s products face intense competition from its competitors’ products. Competitors’ products may be safer, more effective, more effectively marketed or sold, or have lower prices or superior performance features than Abbott’s products. Abbott cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction of competitors’ products.The manufacture of many of Abbott’s products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if Abbott or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing products, Abbott’s business could suffer.The manufacture of many of Abbott’s products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, natural disasters, and environmental factors. In addition, single suppliers are currently used for certain products and materials. If problems arise during the production of a lot or batch of product, those products may have to be discarded. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred. Any of these events could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respect to other lots, batches or products. To the extent Abbott or one of its suppliers experiences significant manufacturing problems, this could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues and profitability.Significant safety concerns could arise for Abbott’s products, which could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues and financial condition.Health care products typically receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration. Following regulatory approval, these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients. Investigators may also conduct additional, and perhaps more extensive, studies. If new safety issues are reported, Abbott may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product. For example, Abbott may be required to provide additional warnings on a product’s label or narrow its approved intended use, either of which could reduce the product’s market acceptance. If serious safety issues arise with an Abbott product, sales of the product could be halted by Abbott or by regulatory authorities. Safety issues affecting suppliers’ or competitors’ products also may reduce the market acceptance of Abbott’s products.In addition, in the ordinary course of business, Abbott is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that its products or the products of other companies that Abbott promotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for or injury to patients. Product liability claims and lawsuits, safety alerts or product recalls, and other allegations of product safety or quality issues, regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome, may have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s business and reputation and on Abbott’s ability to attract and retain customers. Consequences may also include additional costs, a decrease in market share for the products, lower income or exposure to other claims. Product liability losses are self-insured. Product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s profitability and financial condition.Fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial statements and Abbott’s ability to realize projected sales and earnings.Although Abbott’s financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of Abbott’s revenues and costs are realized in other currencies. Sales outside of the United States in 2019 made up approximately 64 percent of Abbott’s net sales. Abbott’s profitability is affected by movement of the U.S. dollar against other currencies. Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies may also affect the reported value of Abbott’s assets and liabilities, as well as its cash flows. Some foreign currencies are subject to government exchange controls. While Abbott enters into hedging arrangements to mitigate some of its foreign currency exposure, Abbott cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or its ability to mitigate these risks.11Information on the impact of foreign exchange rates on Abbott’s financial results is contained in the “Financial Review — Results of Operations” section in Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report. A discussion of the steps taken to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange is contained in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in Abbott’s 2019 Form 10-K. Information on Abbott’s hedging arrangements is contained in Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements in this report.Deterioration in the economic condition and credit quality of certain countries may negatively affect Abbott’s results of operations.Unfavorable economic conditions in certain countries may increase the time it takes to collect outstanding trade receivables. Financial instability and fiscal deficits in these countries may result in additional austerity measures to reduce costs, including health care. Deterioration in the quality of sovereign debt, including credit downgrades, could increase Abbott’s collection risk where a significant amount of Abbott’s receivables in these countries are with governmental health care systems or where Abbott’s customers depend on payment by government health care systems.The international nature of Abbott’s business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause its revenue and profitability to decline.Abbott’s business is subject to risks associated with managing a global supply chain and doing business internationally. Sales outside of the United States in 2019 made up approximately 64 percent of Abbott’s net sales. Additional risks associated with Abbott’s international operations include:●differing local product preferences and product requirements;●trade protection measures, including tariffs, import or export licensing requirements, and changes to international trade agreements;●difficulty in establishing, staffing, and managing operations;●differing labor regulations;●potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;●political and economic instability, including sovereign debt issues;●restrictions on local currency conversion and/or cash extraction;●price controls, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization, and other governmental action;●inflation, recession, and fluctuations in interest rates;●diminished protection of intellectual property; and●potential penalties or other adverse consequences for violations of anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and other similar laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act.Events contemplated by these risks may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s revenues and profitability.Other factors can have a material adverse effect on Abbott’s future profitability and financial condition.Many other factors can affect Abbott’s profitability and its financial condition, including:●changes in or interpretations of laws and regulations, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements, product marketing application standards, product labeling, source and use laws, and environmental laws;●differences between the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and their actual value, particularly for pensions, retiree health care, stock compensation, intangibles, goodwill, and contingent consideration; and for contingent liabilities such as litigation, the absence of a recorded amount, or an amount recorded at the minimum, compared to the actual amount;12●changes in the rate of inflation (including the cost of raw materials, commodities, and supplies), interest rates, market value of Abbott’s equity investments, and the performance of investments held by Abbott or Abbott’s employee benefit trusts;●changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties that transact business with or provide services to Abbott or Abbott’s employee benefit trusts;●changes in business, economic, and political conditions, including: war, political instability, terrorist attacks, the threat of future terrorist activity and related military action; global climate, extreme weather and natural disasters; widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases; the cost and availability of insurance due to any of the foregoing events; labor disputes, strikes, slow-downs, or other forms of labor or union activity; and pressure from third-party interest groups;●changes in Abbott’s business units and investments and changes in the relative and absolute contribution of each to earnings and cash flow resulting from evolving business strategies, changing product mix, changes in tax laws or tax rates both in the U.S. and abroad and opportunities existing now or in the future;●changes in the buying patterns of a major distributor, retailer, or wholesale customer resulting from buyer purchasing decisions, pricing, seasonality, or other factors, or other problems with licensors, suppliers, distributors, and business partners; and●legal difficulties, any of which could preclude or delay commercialization of products or adversely affect profitability, including claims asserting statutory or regulatory violations, and adverse litigation decisions.CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that are based on management’s current expectations, estimates, and projections.

6,ABT,ABBOTT LABORATORIES,2019-02-22,"ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS             In addition to the other information in this report, the following risk factors should be considered before deciding to invest in any ofAbbott's securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to Abbott, or risks Abbott currently considers immaterial, could also affect Abbott's actual results. Abbott's business,financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. Abbott may acquire other businesses, license rights to technologies or products, form alliances, or disposeof or spin-off businesses, which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability.          Abbott may pursue acquisitions, licensing arrangements, and strategic alliances, or dispose of or spin-off some of its businesses, as part ofits business strategy. Abbott may not complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and may not realize the expected benefits. If Abbott is successful in makingan acquisition, the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated. Abbott may not be ableto integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business or transition disposed businesses efficiently, and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities.Abbott could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or disposition-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges forimpairment of long-term assets. These effects could cause a deterioration of Abbott's credit rating, result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense, and decrease liquidity. Abbott is subject to cost containment efforts that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operatingincome.          In the United States and other countries, Abbott's businesses have experienced downward pressure on product pricing. Cost containment efforts bygovernments and private organizations are described in greater detail in the section captioned ""Regulation."" To the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater patient access tohealth care or other factors, Abbott's future revenues and operating income will be reduced. Abbott is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulationsand to develop compliant products and processes.          Abbott's products are subject to rigorous regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and numerous international, supranational,federal, and state authorities. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a drug, medical device, or diagnostic product can be costly and time-consuming, and approvals might not begranted for future products, or additional indications or uses of existing products, on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in the receipt of, or failure to obtain, approvals for future products, or newindications and uses, could result in delayed realization of product revenues, reduction in revenues, and substantial additional costs.         Inaddition, no assurance can be given that Abbott will remain in compliance with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements once approval or marketing authorization has beenobtained for a product. These requirements include, among other things, regulations regarding manufacturing practices, product labeling, and advertising and postmarketing reporting, including adverseevent reports and field alerts. Many of Abbott's facilities and procedures and those of Abbott's suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation, including periodic inspection by the FDA and otherregulatory authorities. Abbott must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations. Possible regulatory actions for non-compliance could include warningletters, fines, damages, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls, seizures of Abbott's products, and criminal prosecution. 9         Theseactions could result in, among other things, substantial modifications to Abbott's business practices and operations; refunds, recalls, or seizures of Abbott's products; a total orpartial shutdown of production in one or more facilities while Abbott or Abbott's suppliers remedy the alleged violation; the inability to obtain future pre-market approvals or marketingauthorizations; and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market. Any of these events could disrupt Abbott's business and have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues,profitability and financial condition. Laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on Abbott, requireAbbott to change its business practices, and restrict its operations in the future.          Abbott's industry is subject to various international, supranational, federal, and state laws and regulations pertaining to government benefitprogram reimbursement, price reporting and regulation, and health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback and false claims laws, and international and individual state laws relating to pricingand sales and marketing practices. Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, substantial fines, imprisonment, and exclusion fromparticipation in government health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and Veterans Administration health programs in the U.S. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and they aresubject to evolving interpretations, which could require Abbott to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices. In addition,violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt Abbott's business and result in a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues, profitability, and financial condition. Changes in the health care regulatory environment may adversely affect Abbott's business.          Both in the U.S. and internationally, government authorities may enact changes in regulatory requirements, make legislative or administrativereforms to existing reimbursement programs, make adverse decisions relating to our products' coverage or reimbursement, or make changes to patient access to health care, all of which could adverselyimpact the demand for and usage of Abbott's products or the prices that Abbott's customers are willing to pay for them.         Further,in the U.S., a number of the provisions of the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 address access tohealth care products and services and establish certain fees for the medical device industry. These provisions may be modified, repealed, or otherwise invalidated, in whole or in part. Futurerulemaking could affect rebates, prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, or required reporting and disclosure. Abbott cannot predict the timing or impact of anyfuture rulemaking or changes in the law.         Foradditional information concerning health care regulation, see the discussion in ""Regulation"" under Item 1, ""Business."" Abbott has incurred and assumed significant indebtedness, which has increased consolidated interest expenseand could decrease business flexibility.          Abbott incurred and assumed significant indebtedness in connection with the 2017 acquisitions of St. Jude Medical and Alere. As ofDecember 31, 2018, Abbott's consolidated indebtedness was approximately $19.6 billion. This consolidated indebtedness increased Abbott's consolidated interest expense and could have theeffect, among other things, of reducing Abbott's flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions, and reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures,acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes.         Further,Abbott may be required to raise additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, future acquisitions or other general corporate purposes. Abbott's ability toarrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on, among other factors, Abbott's financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond Abbott'scontrol. 10 Consequently,Abbott cannot assure that it will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to Abbott or at all, which could adversely impact Abbott's ability to makescheduled payments with respect to its consolidated indebtedness and its profitability and financial condition.         Additionally,further borrowing could cause a deterioration of Abbott's credit rating. Abbott's credit ratings reflect each credit rating agency's then opinion of Abbott's financialstrength, operating performance, and ability to meet its debt obligations. Adverse changes in Abbott's credit ratings may result in increased borrowing costs for future long-term debt or short-termborrowing facilities and may limit financing options, including access to the unsecured borrowing market. Abbott may also be subject to additional restrictive covenants that would reduce flexibility. Abbott depends on sophisticated information technology systems and maintains protected personal data, and acyber attack or other breach affecting these information technology systems or protected data could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's results of operations.          Similar to other large multi-national companies, the size and complexity of the information technology systems on which Abbott relies for bothits infrastructure and products makes them susceptible to a cyber attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy, or other significant disruption. These systems have beenand are expected to continue to be the target of malware and other cyber attacks. In addition, third party hacking attempts may cause Abbott's information technology systems and related products,protected data, or proprietary information to be compromised. A significant attack or other disruption could result in adverse consequences, including increased costs and expenses, problems withproduct functionality, damage to customer relations, lost revenue, and legal or regulatory penalties.         Abbottalso collects, manages and processes protected personal data, including protected health information, in connection with certain medical products and service offerings. Foradditional information concerning data privacy and security regulation, see the discussion in ""Regulation"" under Item 1, ""Business."" A breach of protected personal information could result inadverse consequences, including regulatory inquiries or litigation, increased costs and expenses, reputational damage, lost revenue, and fines or penalties.         Abbottinvests in its systems and technology and in the protection of its products and data to reduce the risk of an attack or other significant disruption, and monitors its systems onan ongoing basis for any current or potential threats and for changes in technology and the regulatory environment. There can be no assurance that these measures and efforts will prevent futureattacks or other significant disruptions to any of the systems on which Abbott relies or that related product issues will not arise inthe future. Any significant attack or other disruption on Abbott's systems or products could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's business. The expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may affect Abbott's future revenues and operatingincome.          Many of Abbott's businesses rely on patent and trademark and other intellectual property protection. Although most of the challenges to Abbott'sintellectual property have come from other companies, governments may also challenge intellectual property protections. To the extent Abbott's intellectual property is successfully challenged,invalidated, or circumvented or to the extent it does not allow Abbott to compete effectively, Abbott's businesses could suffer. To the extent that countries do not enforce Abbott's intellectualproperty rights, Abbott's future revenues and operating income could be reduced. Any material litigation regarding Abbott's patents and trademarks is described in the section captioned ""LegalProceedings."" 11 Competitors' intellectual property may prevent Abbott from selling its products or have a material adverseeffect on Abbott's future profitability and financial condition.          Competitors may claim that an Abbott product infringes upon their intellectual property. Resolving an intellectual property infringement claimcan be costly and time consuming and may require Abbott to enter into license agreements. Abbott cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms. Asuccessful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject Abbott to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture, sale or use of affected Abbott products.Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's profitability and financial condition. Abbott's research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products andtechnologies, which may cause Abbott's revenue and profitability to decline.          To remain competitive, Abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies. To accomplish this, Abbott commits substantial efforts,funds, and other resources to research and development. A risk of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies. Abbott must make ongoing substantialexpenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including after significant funds have been invested.         Promisingnew products and technologies may fail to reach the market or may only have limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achieve positiveclinical outcomes, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, limited scope of approved uses, excessive costs to manufacture, failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights, orinfringement of the intellectual property rights of others. Even if Abbott successfully develops new products or enhancements or new generations of Abbott's existing products, they may be quicklyrendered obsolete by changing customer preferences, changing industry standards, or competitors' innovations. Innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of, among other things,entrenched patterns of clinical practice or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Abbott cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched,whether it will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire compounds or products, or whether any products will be commercially successful. Failure to launch successful new products ortechnologies, or new indications or uses for existing products, may cause Abbott's products or technologies to become obsolete, causing Abbott's revenues and operating results to suffer. New products and technological advances by Abbott's competitors may negatively affect Abbott's results ofoperations.          Abbott's products face intense competition from its competitors' products. Competitors' products may be safer, more effective, more effectivelymarketed or sold, or have lower prices or superior performance features than Abbott's products. Abbott cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction of competitors' products. The manufacture of many of Abbott's products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if Abbott or oneof its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing products, Abbott's business could suffer.          The manufacture of many of Abbott's products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problemsmay arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, natural disasters, andenvironmental factors. In addition, single suppliers are currently used for certain products and materials. If problems arise during the production of a lot or batch of product, those products mayhave to be discarded. This could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, 12 similarlosses with respect to other lots, batches or products. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred. Tothe extent Abbott or one of its suppliers experiences significant manufacturing problems, this could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues and profitability. Significant safety concerns could arise for Abbott's products, which could have a material adverse effect onAbbott's revenues and financial condition.          Health care products typically receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration. Followingregulatory approval, these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients. Investigators may also conduct additional, and perhaps more extensive, studies. If new safety issues arereported, Abbott may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product. For example, Abbott may be required to provide additional warnings on a product's label or narrow its approved intendeduse, either of which could reduce the product's market acceptance. If serious safety issues arise with an Abbott product, sales of the product could be halted by Abbott or by regulatory authorities.Safety issues affecting suppliers' or competitors' products also may reduce the market acceptance of Abbott's products.         Inaddition, in the ordinary course of business, Abbott is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that its products or the products of other companies that Abbottpromotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for or injury to patients. Product liability claims and lawsuits, safety alerts or product recalls, and other allegations of productsafety or quality issues,regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome, may have a material adverse effect on Abbott's business and reputation and on Abbott's ability to attract and retain customers. Consequences may alsoinclude additional costs, a decrease in market share for the products, lower income or exposure to other claims. Product liability losses are self-insured. Product liability claims could have amaterial adverse effect on Abbott's profitability and financial condition. Fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial statements and Abbott'sability to realize projected sales and earnings.          Although Abbott's financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of Abbott's revenues and costs are realized inother currencies. Sales outside of the United States in 2018 made up approximately 65 percent of Abbott's net sales. Abbott's profitability is affected by movement of the U.S. dollar againstother currencies. Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies may also affect the reported value of Abbott's assets and liabilities, as well as its cash flows. Someforeign currencies are subject to government exchange controls. While Abbott enters into hedging arrangements to mitigate some of its foreign currency exposure, Abbott cannot predict with anycertainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or its ability to mitigate these risks.         Informationon the impact of foreign exchange rates on Abbott's financial results is contained in the ""Financial Review  Results of Operations"" section inItem 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report. A discussion of the steps taken to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange iscontained in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in Abbott's 2018 Form 10-K. Information on Abbott's hedging arrangements is contained in Note 12to the consolidated financial statements in this report. Deterioration in the economic condition and credit quality of certain countries may negatively affectAbbott's results of operations.          Unfavorable economic conditions in certain countries may increase the time it takes to collect outstanding trade receivables. Financialinstability and fiscal deficits in these countries may result in additional austerity measures to reduce costs, including health care. Deterioration in the quality of 13 sovereigndebt, including credit downgrades, could increase Abbott's collection risk where a significant amount of Abbott's receivables in these countries are with governmental health care systems orwhere Abbott's customers depend on payment by government health care systems. The international nature of Abbott's business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause itsrevenue and profitability to decline.          Abbott's business is subject to risks associated with managing a global supply chain and doing business internationally. Sales outside of theUnited States in 2018 made up approximately 65 percent of Abbott's net sales. Additional risks associated with Abbott's international operationsinclude: differing local product preferences and product requirements;  trade protection measures, including tariffs, import or export licensing requirements, and changes to international trade agreements;   difficulty in establishing, staffing, and managing operations;  differing labor regulations;  potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;  political and economic instability, including sovereign debt issues;  restrictions on local currency conversion and/or cash extraction;  price controls, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization, and other governmental action;   inflation, recession, and fluctuations in interest rates;  diminished protection of intellectual property; and  potential penalties or other adverse consequences for violations of anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and other similar laws and regulations,including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. Eventscontemplated by these risks may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues and profitability. Other factors can have a material adverse effect on Abbott's future profitability and financial condition.          Many other factors can affect Abbott's profitability and its financial condition, including: changes in or interpretations of laws and regulations, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements, product marketingapplication standards, product labeling, source and use laws, and environmental laws;  differences between the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and their actual value, particularly for pensions, retiree healthcare, stock compensation, intangibles, goodwill, and contingent consideration; and for contingent liabilities such as litigation, the absence of a recorded amount, or an amount recorded at theminimum, compared to the actual amount;  changes in the rate of inflation (including the cost of raw materials, commodities, and supplies), interest rates, market value of Abbott'sequity investments, and the performance of investments held by Abbott or Abbott's employee benefit trusts;  changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties that transact business with or provide services to Abbott or Abbott's employee benefittrusts; 14  changes in business, economic, and political conditions, including: war, political instability, terrorist attacks, the threat of futureterrorist activity and related military action; global climate, extreme weather and natural disasters; widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases, the cost and availability of insurance due to any ofthe foregoing events; labor disputes, strikes, slow-downs, or other forms of labor or union activity; and pressure from third-party interest groups;  changes in Abbott's business units and investments and changes in the relative and absolute contribution of each to earnings and cash flowresulting from evolving business strategies, changing product mix, changes in tax laws or tax rates both in the U.S. and abroad and opportunities existing now or in the future;   changes in the buying patterns of a major distributor, retailer, or wholesale customer resulting from buyer purchasing decisions, pricing,seasonality, or other factors, or other problems with licensors, suppliers, distributors, and business partners; and  legal difficulties, any of which could preclude or delay commercialization of products or adversely affect profitability, including claimsasserting statutory or regulatory violations, and adverse litigation decisions.

16,ABT,ABBOTT LABORATORIES,2018-02-16,"ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS             In addition to the other information in this report, the following risk factors should be considered before deciding to invest in any ofAbbott's securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to Abbott, or risks Abbott currently considers immaterial, could also affect Abbott's actual results. Abbott's business,financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. Abbott may acquire other businesses, license rights to technologies or products, form alliances, or disposeof or spin-off businesses, which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability.          Abbott may pursue acquisitions, licensing arrangements, and strategic alliances, or dispose of or spin-off some of its businesses, as part ofits business strategy. Abbott may not complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and may not realize the expected benefits. If Abbott is successful in makingan acquisition, the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated. Abbott may not be ableto integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business or transition disposed businesses efficiently, and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities.Abbott could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or disposition-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges forimpairment of long-term assets. These effects could cause a deterioration of Abbott's credit rating, result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense, and decrease liquidity. Abbott is subject to cost containment efforts that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operatingincome.          In the United States and other countries, Abbott's businesses have experienced downward pressure on product pricing. Cost containment efforts bygovernments and private organizations are described in greater detail in the section captioned ""Regulation."" To the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater patient access tohealth care or other factors, Abbott's future revenues and operating income will be reduced. Abbott is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulationsand to develop compliant products and processes.          Abbott's products are subject to rigorous regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and numerous international, supranational,federal, and state authorities. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a drug or medical device can be costly and time-consuming, and approvals might not be granted for futureproducts, or additional indications or uses of existing products, on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in the receipt of, or failure to obtain, approvals for future products, or new indications anduses, could result in delayed realization of product revenues, reduction in revenues, and in substantial additional costs.         Inaddition, no assurance can be given that Abbott will remain in compliance with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements once approval or marketing authorization has beenobtained for a product. These requirements include, among other things, regulations regarding manufacturing practices, product labeling, and advertising and postmarketing reporting, including adverseevent reports and field alerts. Many of Abbott's facilities and procedures and those of Abbott's suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation, including periodic inspection by the FDA and otherregulatory authorities. Abbott must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations. Possible regulatory actions for non-compliance could include warningletters, fines, damages, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls, seizures of Abbott's products, and criminal prosecution. 9         Theseactions could result in, among other things, substantial modifications to Abbott's business practices and operations; refunds, recalls, or seizures of Abbott's products; a total orpartial shutdown of production in one or more facilities while Abbott or Abbott's suppliers remedy the alleged violation; the inability to obtain future pre-market approvals or marketingauthorizations; and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market. Any of these events could disrupt Abbott's business and have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues,profitability and financial condition. Laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on Abbott, requireAbbott to change its business practices, and restrict its operations in the future.          Abbott's industry is subject to various international, supranational, federal, and state laws and regulations pertaining to government benefitprogram reimbursement, price reporting and regulation, and health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback and false claims laws, and international and individual state laws relating to pricingand sales and marketing practices. Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, substantial fines, imprisonment, and exclusion fromparticipation in government health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and Veterans Administration health programs in the U.S. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and they aresubject to evolving interpretations, which could require Abbott to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices. In addition,violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt Abbott's business and result in a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues, profitability, and financial condition. Changes in the health care regulatory environment may adversely affect Abbott's business.          Both in the U.S. and internationally, government authorities may enact changes in regulatory requirements, make legislative or administrativereforms to existing reimbursement programs, make adverse decisions relating to our products' coverage or reimbursement, or make changes to patient access to health care, all of which could adverselyimpact the demand for and usage of Abbott's products or the prices that Abbott's customers are willing to pay for them.         Further,in the U.S., a number of the provisions of the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 address access tohealth care products and services and establish certain fees for the medical device industry. These provisions may be modified, repealed, or otherwise invalidated, in whole or in part. Futurerulemaking could affect rebates, prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, or required reporting and disclosure. Abbott cannot predict the timing or impact of anyfuture rulemaking or changes in the law.         Foradditional information concerning health care regulation, see the discussion in ""Regulation"" under Item 1, ""Business."" Abbott incurred and assumed significant indebtedness in connection with the acquisitions of St. JudeMedical and Alere, which could decrease business flexibility and increase consolidated interest expense.          Following the acquisitions of St. Jude Medical and Alere, Abbott's consolidated indebtedness as of December 31, 2017 wasapproximately $28 billion. This consolidated indebtedness could have the effect, among other things, of reducing Abbott's flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions,increasing Abbott's consolidated interest expense, and reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes.         Further,Abbott may be required to raise additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, future acquisitions or other general corporate purposes. Abbott's ability toarrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on, among other factors, Abbott's financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond Abbott'scontrol. Consequently, Abbott cannot assure that it will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on 10 termsacceptable to Abbott or at all, which could adversely impact Abbott's ability to make scheduled payments with respect to its consolidated indebtedness and its profitability and financialcondition.         Additionally,further borrowing could cause a deterioration of Abbott's credit rating. Abbott's credit ratings reflect each credit rating agency's then opinion of Abbott's financialstrength, operating performance, and ability to meet its debt obligations. Adverse changes in Abbott's credit ratings may result in increased borrowing costs for future long-term debt or short-termborrowing facilities and may limit financing options, including access to the unsecured borrowing market. Abbott may also be subject to additional restrictive covenants that would reduce flexibility. Abbott depends on sophisticated information technology systems and a cyber attack or other breach of thesesystems could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's results of operations.          Similar to other large multi-national companies, the size and complexity of the information technology systems on which Abbott relies for bothits infrastructure and products makes them susceptible to a cyber attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy, or other significant disruption. These systems have beenand are expected to continue to be the target of malware and other cyber attacks. In addition, third party hacking attempts may cause Abbott's information technology systems and related products,protected data, or proprietary information to be compromised. A significant attack or other disruption could result in adverse consequences, including increased costs and expenses, problems withproduct functionality, damage to customer relations, lost revenue, and legal or regulatory penalties.         Abbottinvests in its systems and technology and in the protection of its products and data to reduce the risk of an attack or other significant disruption, and monitors its systems onan ongoing basis for any current or potential threats and for changes in technology and the regulatory environment. There can be no assurance that these measures and efforts will prevent futureattacks or other significant disruptions to any of the systems on which Abbott relies or that related product issues will not arise in the future. Any significant attack or other disruption onAbbott's systems or products could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's business. The expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may affect Abbott's future revenues and operatingincome.          Many of Abbott's businesses rely on patent and trademark and other intellectual property protection. Although most of the challenges to Abbott'sintellectual property have come from other businesses, governments may also challenge intellectual property protections. To the extent Abbott's intellectual property is successfully challenged,invalidated, or circumvented or to the extent it does not allow Abbott to compete effectively, Abbott's businesses could suffer. To the extent that countries do not enforce Abbott's intellectualproperty rights, Abbott's future revenues and operating income could be reduced. Any material litigation regarding Abbott's patents and trademarks is described in the section captioned ""LegalProceedings."" Competitors' intellectual property may prevent Abbott from selling its products or have a material adverseeffect on Abbott's future profitability and financial condition.          Competitors may claim that an Abbott product infringes upon their intellectual property. Resolving an intellectual property infringement claimcan be costly and time consuming and may require Abbott to enter into license agreements. Abbott cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms. Asuccessful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject Abbott to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture, sale or use of affected Abbott products.Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's profitability and financial condition. 11 Abbott's research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products andtechnologies, which may cause Abbott's revenue and profitability to decline.          To remain competitive, Abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies. To accomplish this, Abbott commits substantial efforts,funds, and other resources to research and development. A risk of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies. Abbott must make ongoing substantialexpenditures without any assurancethat its efforts will be commercially successful. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including after significant funds have been invested.         Promisingnew products and technologies may fail to reach the market or may only have limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achieve positiveclinical outcomes, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, limited scope of approved uses, excessive costs to manufacture, failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights, orinfringement of the intellectual property rights of others. Even if Abbott successfully develops new products or enhancements or new generations of Abbott's existing products, they may be quicklyrendered obsolete by changing customer preferences, changing industry standards, or competitors' innovations. Innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of, among other things,entrenched patterns of clinical practice or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Abbott cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched,whether it will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire compounds or products, or whether any products will be commercially successful. Failure to launch successful new products ortechnologies, or new indications or uses for existing products, may cause Abbott's products or technologies to become obsolete, causing Abbott's revenues and operating results to suffer. New products and technological advances by Abbott's competitors may negatively affect Abbott's results ofoperations.          Abbott's products face intense competition from its competitors' products. Competitors' products may be safer, more effective, more effectivelymarketed or sold, or have lower prices or superior performance features than Abbott's products. Abbott cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction of competitors' products. The manufacture of many of Abbott's products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if Abbott or oneof its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing products, Abbott's business could suffer.          The manufacture of many of Abbott's products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problemsmay arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, natural disasters, andenvironmental factors. In addition, single suppliers are currently used for certain products and materials. If problems arise during the production of a lot or batch of product, those products mayhave to be discarded. This could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause,similar losses with respect to other lots, batches or products. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred. Tothe extent Abbott or one of its suppliers experiences significantmanufacturing problems, this could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues and profitability. Significant safety concerns could arise for Abbott's products, which could have a material adverse effect onAbbott's revenues and financial condition.          Health care products typically receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration. Followingregulatory approval, these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients. Investigators may also conduct additional, and perhaps more extensive, 12 studies.If new safety issues are reported, Abbott may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product. For example, Abbott may be required to provide additional warnings on a product's labelor narrow its approved intended use, either of which could reduce the product's market acceptance. If serious safety issues arise with an Abbott product, sales of the product could be halted by Abbottor by regulatory authorities. Safety issues affecting suppliers' or competitors' products also may reduce the market acceptance of Abbott's products.         Inaddition, in the ordinary course of business, Abbott is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that its products or the products of other companies that Abbottpromotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for or injury to patients. Product liability claims and lawsuits, safety alerts or product recalls, and other allegations of productsafety or quality issues, regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome, may have a material adverse effect on Abbott's business and reputation and on Abbott's ability to attract and retaincustomers. Consequences may also include additional costs, a decrease in market share for the products, lower income or exposure to other claims. Product liability losses are self-insured. Productliability claims could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's profitability and financial condition. Fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial statements and Abbott'sability to realize projected sales and earnings.          Although Abbott's financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of Abbott's revenues and costs are realized inother currencies. Sales outside of the United States in 2017 made up approximately 65 percent of Abbott's net sales. Abbott's profitability is affected by movement of the U.S. dollar againstother currencies. Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies may also affect the reported value of Abbott's assets and liabilities, as well as its cash flows. Someforeign currencies are subject to government exchange controls. While Abbott enters into hedging arrangements to mitigate some of its foreign currency exposure, Abbott cannot predict with anycertainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or its ability to mitigate these risks.         Informationon the impact of foreign exchange rates on Abbott's financial results is contained in the ""Financial Review  Results of Operations"" section inItem 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report. A discussion of the steps taken to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange iscontained in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in Abbott's 2017 Form 10-K. Information on Abbott's hedging arrangements is contained in Note 11to the consolidated financial statements in this report. Deterioration in the economic condition and credit quality of certain countries may negatively affectAbbott's results of operations.          Unfavorable economic conditions in certain countries may increase the time it takes to collect outstanding trade receivables. Financialinstability and fiscal deficits in these countries may result in additional austerity measures to reduce costs, including health care. Deterioration in the quality of sovereign debt, including creditdowngrades, could increase Abbott's collection risk where a significant amount of Abbott's receivables in these countries are with governmental health care systems or where Abbott's customers dependon payment by government health care systems. The international nature of Abbott's business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause itsrevenue and profitability to decline.          Abbott's business is subject to risks associated with managing a global supply chain and doing business internationally. Sales outside of theUnited States in 2017 made upapproximately 65 percent of Abbott's net sales. Additional risks associated with Abbott's international operations include: differing local product preferences and product requirements;  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;  difficulty in establishing, staffing, and managing operations; 13  differing labor regulations;  potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;  political and economic instability, including sovereign debt issues;  restrictions on local currency conversion and/or cash extraction;  price controls, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization, and other governmental action;   inflation, recession, and fluctuations in interest rates;  diminished protection of intellectual property; and  potential penalties or other adverse consequences for violations of anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and other similar laws and regulations,including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. Eventscontemplated by these risks may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues and profitability. Other factors can have a material adverse effect on Abbott's future profitability and financial condition.          Many other factors can affect Abbott's profitability and its financial condition, including: changes in or interpretations of laws and regulations, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements, product marketingapplication standards, product labeling, source and use laws, and environmental laws;  differences between the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and their actual value, particularly for pensions, retiree healthcare, stock compensation, intangibles, goodwill, and contingent consideration; and for contingent liabilities such as litigation, the absence of a recorded amount, or an amount recorded at theminimum, compared to the actual amount;  changes in the rate of inflation (including the cost of raw materials, commodities, and supplies), interest rates, market value of Abbott'sequity investments, and the performance of investments held by Abbott or Abbott's employee benefit trusts;  changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties that transact business with or provide services to Abbott or Abbott's employee benefittrusts;  changes in business, economic, and political conditions, including: war, political instability, terrorist attacks, the threat of futureterrorist activity and related military action; global climate, extreme weather and natural disasters; widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases, the cost and availability of insurance due to any ofthe foregoing events; labor disputes, strikes, slow-downs, or other forms of labor or union activity; and pressure from third-party interest groups;  changes in Abbott's business units and investments and changes in the relative and absolute contribution of each to earnings and cash flowresulting from evolving business strategies, changing product mix, changes in tax laws or tax rates both in the U.S. and abroad and opportunities existing now or in the future;   changes in the buying patterns of a major distributor, retailer, or wholesale customer resulting from buyer purchasing decisions, pricing,seasonality, or other factors, or other problems with licensors, suppliers, distributors, and business partners; and  legal difficulties, any of which could preclude or delay commercialization of products or adversely affect profitability, including claimsasserting statutory or regulatory violations, and adverse litigation decisions. 14      CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS             This Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that are based on management's current expectations, estimates, and projections.

11,ABT,ABBOTT LABORATORIES,2017-02-17,"ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS             In addition to the other information in this report, the following risk factors should be considered before deciding to invest in any ofAbbott's securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to Abbott, or risks Abbott currently considers immaterial, could also affect Abbott's actual results. Abbott's business,financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. Abbott may acquire other businesses, license rights to technologies or products, form alliances, or disposeof or spin-off businesses, which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability.          Abbott may pursue acquisitions, licensing arrangements, and strategic alliances, or dispose of or spin-off some of its businesses, as part ofits business strategy. Abbott may not complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and may not realize the expected benefits. If Abbott is successful in makingan acquisition, the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated. Abbott may not be ableto integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business or transition disposed businesses efficiently, and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities.Abbott could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or disposition-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges forimpairment of long-term assets. These effects could cause a deterioration of Abbott's credit rating, result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense, and decrease liquidity. Abbott is subject to cost containment efforts that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operatingincome.          In the United States and other countries, Abbott's businesses have experienced downward pressure on product pricing. Cost containment efforts bygovernments and private organizations are described in greater detail in the section captioned ""Regulation."" To the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater patient access tohealth care or other factors, Abbott's future revenues and operating income will be reduced. Abbott is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulationsand to develop compliant products and processes.          Abbott's products are subject to rigorous regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and numerous international, supranational,federal, and state authorities. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a drug or medical device can be costly and time-consuming, and approvals might not be granted for futureproducts, or additional indications or uses of existing products, on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in the receipt of, or failure to obtain, approvals for future products, or new indications anduses, could result in delayed realization of product revenues, reduction in revenues, and in substantial additional costs.         Inaddition, no assurance can be given that Abbott will remain in compliance with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements once approval or marketing authorization has beenobtained for a product. These requirements include, among other things, regulations regarding manufacturing practices, product labeling, and advertising and postmarketing reporting, including adverseevent reports and field alerts. Many of Abbott's facilities and procedures and those of Abbott's suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation, including periodic inspection by the FDA and otherregulatory authorities. Abbott must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations. Possible regulatory actions for non-compliance could include warningletters, fines, damages, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls, seizures of Abbott's products, and criminal prosecution. 9         Theseactions could result in, among other things, substantial modifications to Abbott's business practices and operations; refunds, recalls, or seizures of Abbott's products; a total orpartial shutdown of production in one or more facilities while Abbott or Abbott's suppliers remedy the alleged violation; the inability to obtain future pre-market approvals or marketingauthorizations; and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market. Any of these events could disrupt Abbott's business and have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues,profitability and financial condition. Laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on Abbott, requireAbbott to change its business practices, and restrict its operations in the future.          Abbott's industry is subject to various international, supranational, federal, and state laws and regulations pertaining to government benefitprogram reimbursement, price reporting and regulation, and health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback and false claims laws, and international and individual state laws relating to pricingand sales and marketing practices. Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, substantial fines, imprisonment, and exclusion fromparticipation in government health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and Veterans Administration health programs in the U.S. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and they aresubject to evolving interpretations, which could require Abbott to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices. In addition,violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt Abbott's business and result in a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues, profitability, and financial condition. Changes in the health care regulatory environment may adversely affect Abbott's business.          Both in the U.S. and internationally, government authorities may enact changes in regulatory requirements, make legislative or administrativereforms to existing reimbursement programs, make adverse decisions relating to our products' coverage or reimbursement, or make changes to patient access to health care, all of which could adverselyimpact the demand for and usage of Abbott's products or the prices that Abbott's customers are willing to pay for them.         Further,in the U.S., a number of the provisions of the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 change access tohealth care products and services and establish certain fees for the medical device industry. These provisions may be modified, repealed, or otherwise invalidated, in whole or in part. Futurerulemaking could affect rebates, prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, or required reporting and disclosure. Abbott cannot predict the timing or impact of anyfuture rulemaking or changes in the law.         Foradditional information concerning health care regulation, see the discussion in ""Regulation"" under Item 1, ""Business."" Abbott incurred and assumed significant additional indebtedness in connection with the acquisition ofSt. Jude Medical, which could decrease business flexibility and increase consolidated interest expense.          Following the acquisition of St. Jude Medical, Abbott's consolidated indebtedness as of January 31, 2017 is approximately$27.8 billion, representing a substantial increase in comparison to Abbott's consolidated indebtedness on a recent historical basis. This increased consolidated indebtedness could have theeffect, among other things, of reducing Abbott's flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions, increasing Abbott's consolidated interest expense, and reducing funds availablefor working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes.         Further,Abbott may be required to raise additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, future acquisitions or other general corporate purposes. Abbott's ability toarrange additional financing or refinancing will depend on, among other factors, Abbott's financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond Abbott'scontrol. Consequently, Abbott cannot assure that it will be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on 10 termsacceptable to Abbott or at all, which could adversely impact Abbott's ability to make scheduled payments with respect to its consolidated indebtedness and its profitability and financialcondition. Additionally, further borrowing could cause a deterioration of Abbott's credit rating. Changes in credit markets or to Abbott's credit rating could impact Abbott's ability to obtain financing forits business operations or result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense.          Abbott's credit ratings reflect each credit rating agency's then opinion of Abbott's financial strength, operating performance and ability tomeet its debt obligations. Abbott utilizes the short- and long-term debt markets to obtain capital from time to time. Adverse changes in Abbott's credit ratings may result in increased borrowing costsfor future long-term debt or short-term borrowing facilities and may limit financing options, including access to the unsecured borrowing market. Abbott may also be subject to additional restrictivecovenants that would reduce flexibility. Macroeconomic conditions, such as continued or increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets, may adversely affect Abbott's ability to refinanceexisting debt or obtain additional financing to support operations or to fund new acquisitions or capital-intensive internal initiatives. Abbott depends on sophisticated information technology systems and a cyber attack or other breach of thesesystems could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's results of operations.          Similar to other large multi-national companies, the size and complexity of the information technology systems on which Abbott relies for bothits infrastructure and products makes them susceptible to a cyber attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy, or other significant disruption. These systems have beenand are expected to continue to be the target of malware and other cyber attacks. In addition, third party hacking attempts may cause Abbott's information technology systems and related products,protected data, or proprietary information to be compromised. A significant attack or other disruption could result in adverse consequences, including increased costs and expenses, problems withproduct functionality, damage to customer relations, lost revenue, and legal or regulatory penalties.         Abbottinvests in its systems and technology and in the protection of its products and data to reduce the risk of an attack or other significant disruption, and monitors its systems onan ongoing basis for any current or potential threats and for changes in technology and the regulatory environment. There can be no assurance that these measures and efforts will prevent futureattacks or other significant disruptions to any of the systems on which Abbott relies or that related product issues will not arise inthe future. Any significant attack or other disruption on Abbott's systems or products could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's business. The expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may affect Abbott's future revenues and operatingincome.          Many of Abbott's businesses rely on patent and trademark and other intellectual property protection. Although most of the challenges to Abbott'sintellectual property have come from other businesses, governments may also challenge intellectual property protections. To the extent Abbott's intellectual property is successfully challenged,invalidated, or circumvented or to the extent it does not allow Abbott to compete effectively, Abbott's businesses could suffer. To the extent that countries do not enforce Abbott's intellectualproperty rights or to the extent that countries require compulsory licensing of its intellectual property, Abbott's future revenues and operating income could be reduced. Any material litigationregarding Abbott's patents and trademarks is described in the section captioned ""Legal Proceedings."" 11 Competitors' intellectual property may prevent Abbott from selling its products or have a material adverseeffect on Abbott's future profitability and financial condition.          Competitors may claim that an Abbott product infringes upon their intellectual property. Resolving an intellectual property infringement claimcan be costly and time consuming and may require Abbott to enter into license agreements. Abbott cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commercially reasonable terms. Asuccessful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject Abbott to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture, sale or use of affected Abbott products.Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's profitability and financial condition. Abbott's research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products andtechnologies, which may cause Abbott's revenue and profitability to decline.          To remain competitive, Abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies. To accomplish this, Abbott commits substantial efforts,funds, and other resources to research and development. A high rate of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies. Abbott must make ongoing substantialexpenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including after significant funds have been invested.         Promisingnew products and technologies may fail to reach the market or may only have limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achieve positiveclinical outcomes, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, limited scope of approved uses, excessive costs to manufacture, failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights, orinfringement of the intellectual property rights of others. Even if Abbott successfully develops new products or enhancements or new generations of Abbott's existing products, they may be quicklyrendered obsolete by changing customer preferences, changing industry standards, or competitors' innovations. Innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of, among other things,entrenched patterns of clinical practice or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Abbott cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched,whether it will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire compounds or products, or whether any products will be commercially successful. Failure to launch successful new products ortechnologies, or new indications or uses for existing products, may cause Abbott's products or technologies to become obsolete, causing Abbott's revenues and operating results to suffer. New products and technological advances by Abbott's competitors may negatively affect Abbott's results ofoperations.          Abbott's products face intense competition from its competitors' products. Competitors' products may be safer, more effective, more effectivelymarketed or sold, or have lower prices or superior performance features than Abbott's products. Abbott cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction of competitors' products. The manufacture of many of Abbott's products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if Abbott or oneof its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing products, Abbott's business could suffer.          The manufacture of many of Abbott's products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements. Problemsmay arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, natural disasters, andenvironmental factors. In addition, single suppliers are currently used for certain products and materials. If problems arise during the production of a batch of product, that batch of product mayhave to be discarded. This could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, 12 similarlosses with respect to other batches or products. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred. To theextent Abbott or one of its suppliers experiences significant manufacturing problems, this could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues and profitability. Significant safety concerns could arise for Abbott's products, which could have a material adverse effect onAbbott's revenues and financial condition.          Health care products typically receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration. Followingregulatory approval, these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients. Investigators may also conduct additional, and perhaps more extensive, studies. If new safety issues arereported, Abbott may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product. For example, Abbott may be required to provide additional warnings on a product's label or narrow its approved intendeduse, either of which could reduce the product's market acceptance. If serious safety issues arise with an Abbott product, sales of the product could be halted by Abbott or by regulatory authorities.Safety issues affecting suppliers' or competitors' products also may reduce the market acceptance of Abbott's products.         Inaddition, in the ordinary course of business, Abbott is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that its products or the products of other companies that Abbottpromotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for or injury to patients. Product liability claims and lawsuits, safety alerts or product recalls, and other allegations of productsafety or quality issues,regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome, may have a material adverse effect on Abbott's business and reputation and on Abbott's ability to attract and retain customers. Consequences may alsoinclude additional costs, a decrease in market share for the products, lower income or exposure to other claims. Product liability losses are self-insured. Product liability claims could have amaterial adverse effect on Abbott's profitability and financial condition. Abbott cannot predict at this time whether or when it will consummate the acquisition of Alere Inc.          On January 30, 2016, Abbott entered into a merger agreement to acquire Alere Inc. Since entering into the merger agreement,several key developments occurred with respect to Alere, including three new, separate investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice (two of which are criminal investigations), delays in the filingof Alere's required annual (Form 10-K) and quarterly (Form 10-Q) SEC reports, management's disclosure of unremediated material weaknesses over financial reporting, the issuance of anopinion by Alere's auditors that Alere did not maintain effective internal control because of material weaknesses over financial reporting related to revenue recognition, a product recall followingnotice from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and the revocation of the Medicare billing privileges of an Alere business unit by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Thesedevelopments led Abbott to file a complaint against Alere in the Delaware Court of Chancery, seeking to terminate the merger agreement on the grounds that Alere has experienced a ""materialadverse effect"" under the merger agreement and has materially breached certain of its covenants. The outcome of the lawsuit, however, is not certain, and Abbott cannot predict at this time whether orwhen it will consummate the acquisition of Alere. Abbott holds a significant investment in Mylan N.V. and is subject to market risk.          In February 2015, Abbott completed the disposition of its developed markets branded generics pharmaceuticals business to Mylan N.V. inexchange for 110,000,000 Mylan N.V. ordinary shares. In April 2015, Abbott sold 40,250,000 of these Mylan N.V. ordinary shares. Abbott currently owns 69,750,000 ordinary shares. As longas Abbott holds the shares, Abbott will have a substantial undiversified equity investment in Mylan N.V. and, therefore, will be subject to the risk of changes in the market value of thoseshares. 13 Fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial statements and Abbott'sability to realize projected sales and earnings.          Although Abbott's financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of Abbott's revenues and costs are realized inother currencies. Sales outside of the United States in 2016 made up approximately 70 percent of Abbott's net sales. Abbott's profitability is affected by movement of the U.S. dollar againstother currencies. Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies may also affect the reported value of Abbott's assets and liabilities, as well as its cash flows. Someforeign currencies are subject to government exchange controls. While Abbott enters into hedging arrangements to mitigate some of its foreign currency exposure, Abbott cannot predict with anycertainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or its ability to mitigate these risks.         Informationon the impact of foreign exchange rates on Abbott's financial results is contained in the ""Financial Review  Results of Operations"" section inItem 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report. A discussion of the steps taken to mitigate the impact of foreign exchange iscontained in Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk in Abbott's 2016 Form 10-K. Information on Abbott's hedging arrangements is contained in Note 11to the consolidated financial statements in this report. Deterioration in the economic condition and credit quality of certain countries may negatively affectAbbott's results of operations.          Unfavorable economic conditions in certain countries may increase the time it takes to collect outstanding trade receivables. Financialinstability and fiscal deficits in these countries may result in additional austerity measures to reduce costs, including health care. Deterioration in the quality of sovereign debt, including creditdowngrades, could increase Abbott's collection risk where a significant amount of Abbott's receivables in these countries are with governmental health care systems or where Abbott's customers dependon payment by government health care systems. The international nature of Abbott's business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause itsrevenue and profitability to decline.          Abbott's business is subject to risks associated with managing a global supply chain and doing business internationally. Sales outside of theUnited States in 2016 made upapproximately 70 percent of Abbott's net sales. Additional risks associated with Abbott's international operations include: differing local product preferences and product requirements;  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;  difficulty in establishing, staffing, and managing operations;  differing labor regulations;  potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;  political and economic instability, including sovereign debt issues;  restrictions on local currency conversion and/or cash extraction;  price controls, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization, and other governmental action;   inflation, recession, and fluctuations in interest rates;  compulsory licensing or diminished protection of intellectual property; and  potential penalties or other adverse consequences for violations of anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and other similar laws and regulations,including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. 14 Eventscontemplated by these risks may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues and profitability. Other factors can have a material adverse effect on Abbott's future profitability and financial condition.          Many other factors can affect Abbott's profitability and its financial condition, including: changes in or interpretations of laws and regulations, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements, product marketingapplication standards, product labeling, source and use laws, and environmental laws;  differences between the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and their actual value, particularly for pensions, retiree healthcare, stock compensation, intangibles, goodwill, and contingent consideration; and for contingent liabilities such as litigation, the absence of a recorded amount, or an amount recorded at theminimum, compared to the actual amount;  changes in the rate of inflation (including the cost of raw materials, commodities, and supplies), interest rates, market value of Abbott'sequity investments, and the performance of investments held by Abbott or Abbott's employee benefit trusts;  changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties that transact business with or provide services to Abbott or Abbott's employee benefittrusts;  changes in business, economic, and political conditions, including: war, political instability, terrorist attacks, the threat of futureterrorist activity and related military action; global climate, extreme weather and natural disasters; widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases, the cost and availability of insurance due to any ofthe foregoing events; labor disputes, strikes, slow-downs, or other forms of labor or union activity; and pressure from third-party interest groups;  changes in Abbott's business units and investments and changes in the relative and absolute contribution of each to earnings and cash flowresulting from evolving business strategies, changing product mix, changes in tax laws or tax rates both in the U.S. and abroad and opportunities existing now or in the future;   changes in the buying patterns of a major distributor, retailer, or wholesale customer resulting from buyer purchasing decisions, pricing,seasonality, or other factors, or other problems with licensors, suppliers, distributors, and business partners; and  legal difficulties, any of which could preclude or delay commercialization of products or adversely affect profitability, including claimsasserting statutory or regulatory violations, and adverse litigation decisions.

0,ABT,ABBOTT LABORATORIES,2016-02-19,"ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS             In addition to the other information in this report, the following risk factors should be considered before deciding to invest in anyof Abbott's securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to Abbott, or risks Abbott currently considers immaterial, could also affect Abbott's actual results. Abbott's business,financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. Abbott may acquire other businesses, license rights to technologies or products, form alliances, ordispose of or spin-off businesses, which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability.          Abbott may pursue acquisitions, licensing arrangements, and strategic alliances, or dispose of or spin-off some of its businesses, aspart of its business strategy. Abbott may not complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and may not realize the expected benefits. If Abbott is successfulin making an acquisition, the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated. Abbott maynot be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business or transition disposed businesses efficiently, and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingentliabilities. Abbott could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or disposition-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles andcharges for impairment of long-term assets. These effects could cause a deterioration of Abbott's credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense. Abbott is subject to cost containment efforts that could cause a reduction in future revenues andoperating income.          In the United States and other countries, Abbott's businesses have experienced downward pressure on product pricing. Cost containmentefforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in the section captioned ""Regulation."" To the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater patientaccess to health care or other factors, Abbott's future revenues and operating income will be reduced. Abbott is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with theseregulations and to develop compliant products and processes.          Abbott's products are subject to rigorous regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and numerous international,supranational, federal, and state authorities. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a drug or medical device can be costly and time-consuming, and approvals might not be granted forfuture products, or additional indications or uses of existing products, on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in the receipt of, or failure to obtain approvals for, future products, or new indicationsand uses, could result in delayed realization of product revenues, reduction in revenues, and in substantial additional costs.         Inaddition, no assurance can be given that Abbott will remain in compliance with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements once approval or marketing authorization has beenobtained for a product. These requirements include, among other things, regulations regarding manufacturing practices, product labeling, and advertising and postmarketing reporting, including adverseevent reports and field alerts due to manufacturing quality concerns. Many of Abbott's facilities and procedures and those of Abbott's suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation, including periodicinspection by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Abbott must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations. Possible regulatory actions fornon-compliance could include warning letters, fines, damages, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls, seizures of Abbott's products, and criminal prosecution. 9 Theseactions could result in, among other things, substantial modifications to Abbott's business practices and operations; refunds, recalls, or seizures of Abbott's products; a total or partialshutdown of production in one or more of Abbott's facilities while Abbott or Abbott's suppliers remedy the alleged violation; the inability to obtain future pre-market approvals or marketingauthorizations; and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market. Any of these events could disrupt Abbott's business and have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues,profitability and financial condition. Laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on Abbott,require Abbott to change its business practices, and restrict its operations in the future.          Abbott's industry is subject to various international, supranational, federal, and state laws and regulations pertaining to governmentbenefit program reimbursement, price reporting and regulation, and health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback and false claims laws, and international and individual state laws relating topricing and sales and marketing practices. Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, substantial fines, imprisonment, and exclusionfrom participation in government health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and Veterans Administration health programs in the U.S. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and they aresubject to evolving interpretations, which could require Abbott to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices. In addition,violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt Abbott's business and result in a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues, profitability, and financial condition. Changes in the health care regulatory environment may adversely affect Abbott's business.          Both in the U.S. and internationally, government authorities may enact changes in regulatory requirements, legislative oradministrative reforms to existing reimbursement programs, or make adverse decisions relating to our products' coverage or reimbursement, all of which could adversely impact the demand for and usageof our products or the prices that our customers are willing to pay for them.         Inthe U.S., a number of the provisions of the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 change access to health careproducts and services and establish new fees for the medical device industry. Future rulemaking could increase rebates, reduce prices or the rate of price increases for health care products andservices, or require additional reporting and disclosure. Abbott cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking.         Foradditional information concerning health care regulation, see the discussion in ""Regulation"" under Item 1, ""Business."" The expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may affect Abbott's future revenues andoperating income.          Many of Abbott's businesses rely on patent and trademark and other intellectual property protection. Although most of the challenges toAbbott's intellectual property have come from other businesses, governments may also challenge intellectual property protections. To the extent Abbott's intellectual property is successfullychallenged, invalidated, or circumvented or to the extent it does not allow Abbott to compete effectively, Abbott's businesses could suffer. To the extent that countries do not enforce Abbott'sintellectual property rights or to the extent that countries require compulsory licensing of its intellectual property, Abbott's future revenues and operating income could be reduced. Litigationregarding Abbott's patents and trademarks is described in the section captioned ""Legal Proceedings."" 10 Competitors' intellectual property may prevent Abbott from selling its products or have a materialadverse effect on Abbott's future profitability and financial condition.          Competitors may claim that an Abbott product infringes upon their intellectual property. Resolving an intellectual propertyinfringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require Abbott to enter into license agreements. Abbott cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commerciallyreasonable terms. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject Abbott to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture, sale or use ofaffected Abbott products. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's profitability and financial condition. Abbott's research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successfulproducts and technologies, which may cause Abbott's revenue and profitability to decline.          To remain competitive, Abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies. To accomplish this, Abbott commits substantialefforts, funds, and other resources to research and development. A high rate of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies. Abbott must make ongoingsubstantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including after significant funds have been invested.         Promisingnew product candidates may fail to reach the market or may only have limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achieve positive clinicaloutcomes, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, limited scope of approved uses, excessive costs to manufacture, the failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights, orinfringement of the intellectual property rights of others. Even if Abbott successfully develops new products or enhancements or new generations of Abbott's existing products, they may be quicklyrendered obsolete by changing customer preferences, changing industry standards, or competitors' innovations. Innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of, among other things,entrenched patterns of clinical practice or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Abbott cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched,whether it will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire compounds or products, or whether any products will be commercially successful. Failure to launch successful new products or newindications for existing products may cause Abbott's products to become obsolete, causing Abbott's revenues and operating results to suffer. New products and technological advances by Abbott's competitors may negatively affect Abbott'sresults of operations.          Abbott's products face intense competition from its competitors' products. Competitors' products may be safer, more effective, moreeffectively marketed or sold, or have lower prices or superior performance features than Abbott's products. Abbott cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction ofcompetitors' products. The manufacture of many of Abbott's products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if Abbottor one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing products, Abbott's business could suffer.          The manufacture of many of Abbott's products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements.Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, natural disasters,and environmental factors. In addition, single suppliers are currently used for certain products and materials. If problems arise during the production of a batch of product, that batch of product mayhave to be discarded. This could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, 11 similarlosses with respect to other batches or products. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred. To theextent Abbott or one of its suppliers experiences significant manufacturing problems, this could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues and profitability. Significant safety concerns could arise for Abbott's products, which could have a material adverseeffect on Abbott's revenues and financial condition.          Health care products typically receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration.Following regulatory approval, these productswill be used over longer periods of time in many patients. Investigators may also conduct additional, and perhaps more extensive, studies. If new safety issues are reported, Abbott may be required toamend the conditions of use for a product. For example, Abbott may be required to provide additional warnings on a product's label or narrow its approved intended use, either of which could reduce theproduct's market acceptance. If serious safety issues arise with an Abbott product, sales of the product could be halted by Abbott or by regulatory authorities. Safety issues affecting suppliers' orcompetitors' products also may reduce the market acceptance of Abbott's products.         Inaddition, in the ordinary course of business, Abbott is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that its products or the products of other companies that Abbottpromotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for or injury to patients. Product liability claims and lawsuits, safety alerts or product recalls, and other allegations of productsafety or quality issues, regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome, may have a material adverse effect on Abbott's business and reputation and on Abbott's ability to attract and retaincustomers. Consequences may also include additional costs, a decrease in market share for the products, lower income or exposure to other claims. Product liability losses are self-insured. Productliability claims could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's profitability and financial condition. Deterioration in the economic position and credit quality of certain countries may negatively affectAbbott's results of operations.          Unfavorable economic conditions in certain countries may increase the time it takes to collect outstanding trade receivables. Financialinstability and fiscal deficits in these countries may result in additional austerity measures to reduce costs, including health care. Deterioration in the quality of sovereign debt, including creditdowngrades, could increase Abbott's collection risk where a significant amount of Abbott's receivables in these countries are with governmental health care systems. Abbott depends on sophisticated information technology systems and a cyber attack or other breach ofthese systems could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's results of operations.          Similar to other large multi-national companies, the size and complexity of the information technology systems on which Abbott reliesmakes them vulnerable to a cyber attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy, or other significant disruption. These systems have been and are expected to continue to bethe target of malware and other cyber attacks. In addition, third party hacking attempts may cause data relating to customers or Abbott's proprietary information to be compromised.         Abbotthas invested in its systems and the protection of its data to reduce the risk of an invasion or interruption and monitors its systems on an ongoing basis for any current orpotential threats. There can be no assurance that these measures and efforts will prevent future interruptions or breakdowns to any of the systems on which Abbott relies and that could have asignificant effect on Abbott's business. 12 Abbott may incur operational difficulties or be exposed to claims and liabilities as a result of theseparation.          AbbVie and Abbott entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements to govern the separation of AbbViefrom Abbott and the relationship between the two companies going forward. These arrangements could lead to disputes between Abbott and AbbVie over Abbott's rights to certain shared property and rightsand over the allocation of costs and revenues for products and operations. The separation and distribution agreement also provides for, among other things, indemnification obligations designed to makeAbbVie financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist relating to its business activities, whether incurred prior to or after AbbVie's separation from Abbott, as well asthose obligations of Abbott assumed by AbbVie pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement. It is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between Abbott and AbbVie andrequire Abbott to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to AbbVie. Third parties could also seek to hold Abbott responsible for any of these liabilities or obligations. The indemnity rightsAbbott has under the separation agreement may not be sufficient to protect Abbott. Even if Abbott is successful in obtaining indemnification, Abbott may have to bear losses temporarily. In addition,Abbott's indemnity obligations to AbbVie may be significant. These risks could negatively affect Abbott's results of operations. There could be significant liability if the distribution of AbbVie common stock to Abbottshareholders is determined to be a taxable transaction.          Abbott received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to the effect that, among other things, the separationand the distribution of AbbVie qualifies as a transaction that is tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code). Inaddition, Abbott received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the separation and distribution qualifies as a transaction that is described in Sections 355(a) and 368(a)(1)(D)of the Code. The ruling and the opinion rely on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from Abbott and AbbVie regarding the past and future conduct of the companies' respectivebusinesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings is incorrect or not satisfied, Abbott and its shareholders may not beable to rely on the ruling or the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the receipt by Abbott of the private letter ruling from the IRS andopinion of tax counsel, the IRS could determine on audit that the separation is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or havebeen violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion that are not covered by the private letter ruling, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes inthe share ownership of Abbott or AbbVie after the separation. If the separation is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Abbott and its shareholders that are subject to U.S.federal income tax could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. Abbott holds a significant investment in Mylan N.V. and is subject to market risk.          On February 27, 2015, Abbott completed the disposition of its developed markets branded generics pharmaceuticals business and,in exchange, received 110,000,000 Mylan N.V. ordinary shares. In April 2015, Abbott sold 40,250,000 of these Mylan N.V. ordinary shares. Abbott currently owns 69,750,000Mylan N.V. ordinary shares. As long as Abbott holds the remaining shares, Abbott will have a substantial undiversified equity investment in Mylan N.V. and, therefore, will be subject tothe risk of changes in the market value of those shares. Fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial statements andAbbott's ability to realize projected sales and earnings.          Although Abbott's financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of Abbott's revenues and costs arerealized in other currencies. Abbott's profitability is affected by movement 13 ofthe U.S. dollar against other currencies. Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies may also affect the reported value of Abbott's assets and liabilities, as wellas its cash flows. Some foreign currencies are subject to government exchange controls. While Abbott enters into hedging arrangements to mitigate some of its foreign currency exposure, Abbott cannotpredict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or its ability to mitigate these risks. The international nature of Abbott's business subjects it to additional business risks that maycause its revenue and profitability to decline.          Abbott's business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Sales outside of the United States make upapproximately 70 percent of Abbott's net sales. Additional risks associated with Abbott's international operations include: differing local product preferences and product requirements;  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;  difficulty in establishing, staffing, and managing operations;  differing labor regulations;  potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;  political and economic instability, including sovereign debt issues;  price controls, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization, and other governmental action;   inflation, recession, and fluctuations in interest rates;  compulsory licensing or diminished protection of intellectual property; and  potential penalties or other adverse consequences for violations of anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and other similar laws andregulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. Eventscontemplated by these risks may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues and profitability. Other factors can have a material adverse effect on Abbott's future profitability and financialcondition.          Many other factors can affect Abbott's profitability and its financial condition,including: changes in or interpretations of laws and regulations, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements, productmarketing application standards, product labeling, source and use laws, and environmental laws;  differences between the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and their actual value, particularly for pensions, retireehealth care, stock compensation, intangibles, and goodwill; and for contingent liabilities such as litigation, the absence of a recorded amount, or an amount recorded at the minimum, compared to theactual amount;  changes in the rate of inflation (including the cost of raw materials, commodities, and supplies), interest rates, market value ofAbbott's equity investments, and the performance of investments held by Abbott or Abbott's employee benefit trusts;  changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties that transact business with or provide services to Abbott or Abbott's employeebenefit trusts; 14  changes in business, economic, and political conditions, including: war, political instability, terrorist attacks, the threat offuture terrorist activity and related military action; global climate, extreme weather and natural disasters; widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases, the cost and availability of insurance due toany of the foregoing events; labor disputes, strikes, slow-downs, or other forms of labor or union activity; and pressure from third-party interest groups;   changes in Abbott's business units and investments and changes in the relative and absolute contribution of each to earnings and cashflow resulting from evolving business strategies, changing product mix, changes in tax laws or tax rates both in the U.S. and abroad and opportunities existing now or in the future;   changes in the buying patterns of a major distributor, retailer, or wholesale customer resulting from buyer purchasing decisions,pricing, seasonality, or other factors, or other problems with licensors, suppliers, distributors, and business partners;  changes in credit markets or to Abbott's credit rating could impact Abbott's ability to obtain financing for its business operationsor result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense; and  legal difficulties, any of which could preclude or delay commercialization of products or adversely affect profitability, includingclaims asserting statutory or regulatory violations, and adverse litigation decisions.

17,ABT,ABBOTT LABORATORIES,2015-02-27,"ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS             In addition to the other information in this report, the following risk factors should be considered before deciding to invest in anyof Abbott's securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to Abbott, or risks Abbott currently considers immaterial, could also affect Abbott's actual results. Abbott's business,financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. Abbott may acquire other businesses, license rights to technologies or products, form alliances, ordispose of or spin-off businesses, which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability.          Abbott may pursue acquisitions, licensing arrangements, and strategic alliances, or dispose of or spin-off some of its businesses, aspart of its business strategy. Abbott maynot complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and may not realize the expected benefits. If Abbott is successful in making an acquisition, the products andtechnologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated. Abbott may not be able to integrate acquisitionssuccessfully into its existing business or transition disposed businesses efficiently, and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities. Abbott could also experiencenegative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or disposition-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of long-term assets.These effects could cause a deterioration of Abbott's credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense. Abbott is subject to cost containment efforts that could cause a reduction in future revenues andoperating income.          In the United States and other countries, Abbott's businesses have experienced downward pressure on product pricing. Cost containmentefforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in the section captioned ""Regulation."" To the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater patientaccess to health care or other factors, Abbott's future revenues and operating income will be reduced. Abbott is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with theseregulations and to develop compliant products and processes.          Abbott's products are subject to rigorous regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and numerous international,supranational, federal, and state authorities. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a drug or medical device can be costly and time-consuming, and approvals might not be granted forfuture products, or additional indications or uses of existing products, on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in the receipt of, or failure to obtain approvals for, future products, or new indicationsand uses, could result in delayed realization of product revenues, reduction in revenues, and in substantial additional costs.         Inaddition, no assurance can be given that Abbott will remain in compliance with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements once approval or marketing authorization has beenobtained for a product. These requirements include, among other things, regulations regarding manufacturing practices, product labeling, and advertising and postmarketing reporting, including adverseevent reports and field alerts due to manufacturing quality concerns. Many of Abbott's facilities and procedures and those of Abbott's suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation, including periodicinspection by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Abbott must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations. Possible regulatory actions fornon-compliance could include warning letters, fines, damages, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls,seizures of Abbott's products, and criminal prosecution. These actions could result in, among other things, substantial modifications to Abbott's business practices 8 andoperations; refunds, recalls, or seizures of Abbott's products; a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more of Abbott's facilities while Abbott or Abbott's suppliers remedy thealleged violation; the inability to obtain future pre-market approvals or marketing authorizations; and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market. Any of these events coulddisrupt Abbott's business and have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues, profitability and financial condition. Laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on Abbott,require Abbott to change its business practices, and restrict its operations in the future.          Abbott's industry is subject to various international, supranational, federal, and state laws and regulations pertaining to governmentbenefit program reimbursement, price reporting and regulation, and health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback and false claims laws, and international and individual state laws relating topricing and sales and marketing practices. Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, substantial fines, imprisonment, and exclusionfrom participation in government health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and Veterans Administration health programs in the U.S. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and they aresubject to evolving interpretations, which could require Abbott to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices. In addition,violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt Abbott's business and result in a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues, profitability, and financial condition. Changes in the health care regulatory environment may adversely affect Abbott's business.          A number of the provisions of the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Actof 2010 change access to health care products and services and establish new fees for the medical device industry. Future rulemaking could increase rebates, reduce prices or the rate of priceincreases for health care products and services, or require additional reporting and disclosure. Abbott cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking. The expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may affect Abbott's future revenues andoperating income.          Many of Abbott's businesses rely on patent and trademark and other intellectual property protection. Although most of the challenges toAbbott's intellectual property have come from other businesses, governments may also challenge intellectual property protections. To the extent Abbott's intellectual property is successfullychallenged, invalidated, or circumvented or to the extent it does not allow Abbott to compete effectively, Abbott's businesses could suffer. To the extent that countries do not enforce Abbott'sintellectual property rights or to the extent that countries require compulsory licensing of its intellectual property, Abbott's future revenues and operating income could be reduced. Litigationregarding Abbott's patents and trademarks is described in the section captioned ""Legal Proceedings."" Competitors' intellectual property may prevent Abbott from selling its products or have a materialadverse effect on Abbott's future profitability and financial condition.          Competitors may claim that an Abbott product infringes upon their intellectual property. Resolving an intellectual propertyinfringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require Abbott to enter into license agreements. Abbott cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commerciallyreasonable terms. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject Abbott to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture, sale or use ofaffected Abbott products. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's profitability and financial condition. 9 Abbott's research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successfulproducts and technologies, which may cause Abbott's revenue and profitability to decline.          To remain competitive, Abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies. To accomplish this, Abbott commits substantialefforts, funds, and other resources toresearch and development. A high rate of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies. Abbott must make ongoing substantial expenditures without any assurancethat its efforts will be commercially successful. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including after significant funds have been invested.         Promisingnew product candidates may fail to reach the market or may only have limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achieve positive clinicaloutcomes, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, limited scope of approved uses, excessive costs to manufacture, the failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights, orinfringement of the intellectual property rights of others. Even if Abbott successfully develops new products or enhancements or new generations of Abbott's existing products, they may be quicklyrendered obsolete by changing customer preferences, changing industry standards, or competitors' innovations. Innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of, among other things,entrenched patterns of clinical practice or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Abbott cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched,whether it will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire compounds or products, or whether any products will be commercially successful. Failure to launch successful new products or newindications for existing products may cause Abbott's products to become obsolete, causing Abbott's revenues and operating results to suffer. New products and technological advances by Abbott's competitors may negatively affect Abbott'sresults of operations.          Abbott's products face intense competition from its competitors' products. Competitors' products may be safer, more effective, moreeffectively marketed or sold, or have lower prices or superior performance features than Abbott's products. Abbott cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction ofcompetitors' products. The manufacture of many of Abbott's products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if Abbottor one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing products, Abbott's business could suffer.          The manufacture of many of Abbott's products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements.Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, natural disasters,and environmental factors. In addition, single suppliers are currently used for certain products and materials. If problems arise during the production of a batch of product, that batch of product mayhave to be discarded. This could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause,similar losses with respect to other batches or products. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred. To theextent Abbott or one of its suppliersexperiences significant manufacturing problems, this could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues and profitability. Significant safety concerns could arise for Abbott's products, which could have a material adverseeffect on Abbott's revenues and financial condition.          Health care products typically receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration.Following regulatory approval, these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients. Investigators may also conduct additional, and perhaps more extensive, studies. If new safetyissues are reported, Abbott may be required to amend the conditions of use for a 10 product.For example, Abbott may be required to provide additional warnings on a product's label or narrow its approved intended use, either of which could reduce the product's market acceptance. Ifserious safety issues arise with an Abbott product, sales of the product could be halted by Abbott or by regulatory authorities. Safety issues affecting suppliers' or competitors' products also mayreduce the market acceptance of Abbott's products.         Inaddition, in the ordinary course of business, Abbott is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that its products or the products of other companies that Abbottpromotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for or injury to patients. Product liability claims and lawsuits, safety alerts or product recalls, and other allegations of productsafety or quality issues, regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome, may have a material adverse effect on Abbott's business and reputation and on Abbott's ability to attract and retaincustomers. Consequences may also include additional costs, a decrease in market share for the products, lower income or exposure to other claims. Product liability losses are self-insured. Productliability claims could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's profitability and financial condition. Deterioration in the economic position and credit quality of certain countries may negatively affectAbbott's results of operations.          Unfavorable economic conditions in certain countries may increase the time it takes to collect outstanding trade receivables. Financialinstability and fiscal deficits in these countries may result in additional austerity measures to reduce costs, including health care. Deterioration in the quality of sovereign debt, including creditdowngrades, could increase Abbott's collection risk where a significant amount of Abbott's receivables in these countries are with governmental health care systems. Abbott depends on sophisticated information technology systems to operate its business and a cyberattack or other breach of these systems could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's results of operations.          Similar to other large multi-national companies, the size and complexity of Abbott's information technology systems makes themvulnerable to a cyber attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy, or other significant disruption. Abbott's systems have been and are expected to continue to be thetarget of malware and other cyber attacks. Abbott has invested in its systems and the protection of its data to reduce the risk of an invasion or interruption and monitors its systems on an ongoingbasis for any current or potential threats. There can be no assurance that these measures and efforts will prevent future interruptions or breakdowns that could have a significant effect on Abbott'sbusiness. Abbott may incur operational difficulties or be exposed to claims and liabilities as a result of theseparation.          AbbVie and Abbott entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements to govern the separation of AbbViefrom Abbott and the relationship between the two companies going forward. These arrangements could lead to disputes between Abbott and AbbVie over Abbott's rights to certain shared property and rightsand over the allocation of costs and revenues for products and operations. The separation and distribution agreement also provides for, among other things, indemnification obligations designed to makeAbbVie financially responsible for substantially all liabilities that may exist relating to its business activities, whether incurred prior to or after AbbVie's separation from Abbott, as well asthose obligations of Abbott assumed by AbbVie pursuant to the separation and distribution agreement. It is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between Abbott and AbbVie andrequire Abbott to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to AbbVie. Third parties could also seek to hold Abbott responsible for any of these liabilities or obligations. The indemnity rightsAbbott has under the separation agreement may not be sufficient to protect Abbott. Even if Abbott is successful in obtaining indemnification, Abbott may have to bear losses temporarily. In addition,Abbott's 11 indemnityobligations to AbbVie may be significant. These risks could negatively affect Abbott's results of operations. There could be significant liability if the distribution of AbbVie common stock to Abbottshareholders is determined to be a taxable transaction.          Abbott received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to the effect that, among other things, the separationand the distribution of AbbVie qualifies as a transaction that is tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code). Inaddition, Abbott received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the separation and distribution qualifies as a transaction that is described in Sections 355(a) and 368(a)(1)(D)of the Code. The ruling and the opinion rely on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from Abbott and AbbVie regarding the past and future conduct of the companies' respectivebusinesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied, Abbott and its shareholders may not be able to rely on the ruling orthe opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the receipt by Abbott of the private letter ruling from the IRS and opinion of tax counsel, the IRScould determine on audit that the separation is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagreeswith the conclusions in the opinion that are not covered by the private letter ruling, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in the share ownership of Abbott orAbbVie after the separation. If the separation is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Abbott and its shareholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incursignificant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. Abbott holds a significant investment in Mylan N.V. and is subject to market risk.          On February 27, 2015, Abbott completed the disposition of its developed markets branded generics pharmaceuticals business and,in exchange, received 110,000,000 Mylan N.V. ordinary shares. As long as Abbott holds the shares, Abbott will have a substantial undiversified equity investment in Mylan and, therefore, will besubject to the risk of changes in the market value of those shares. Fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial statements andAbbott's ability to realize projected sales and earnings.          Although Abbott's financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of Abbott's revenues and costs arerealized in other currencies. Abbott's profitability is affected by movement of the U.S. dollar against other currencies. Fluctuations in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currenciesmay also affect the reported value of Abbott's assets and liabilities, as well as its cash flows. Some foreign currencies are subject to government exchange controls. While Abbott enters into hedgingarrangements to mitigate some of its foreign currency exposure, Abbott cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or its ability to mitigate these risks. The international nature of Abbott's business subjects it to additional business risks that maycause its revenue and profitability to decline.          Abbott's business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Sales outside of the United States make upapproximately 70 percent of Abbott's net sales. Additional risks associated with Abbott's international operations include: differing local product preferences and product requirements;  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements;  difficulty in establishing, staffing, and managing operations; 12  differing labor regulations;  potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;  political and economic instability, including sovereign debt issues;  price controls, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization, and other governmental action;   inflation, recession, and fluctuations in interest rates;  compulsory licensing or diminished protection of intellectual property; and  potential penalties or other adverse consequences for violations of anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and other similar laws andregulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. Eventscontemplated by these risks may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues and profitability. Other factors can have a material adverse effect on Abbott's future profitability and financialcondition.          Many other factors can affect Abbott's profitability and its financial condition,including: changes in or interpretations of laws and regulations, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements, productmarketing application standards, product labeling, source and use laws, and environmental laws;  differences between the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and their actual value, particularly for pensions, retireehealth care, stock compensation, intangibles, and goodwill; and for contingent liabilities such as litigation, the absence of a recorded amount, or an amount recorded at the minimum, compared to theactual amount;  changes in the rate of inflation (including the cost of raw materials, commodities, and supplies), interest rates, market value ofAbbott's equity investments, and the performance of investments held by Abbott or Abbott's employee benefit trusts;  changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties that transact business with or provide services to Abbott or Abbott's employeebenefit trusts;  changes in business, economic, and political conditions, including: war, political instability, terrorist attacks, the threat offuture terrorist activity and related military action; natural disasters; the cost and availability of insurance due to any of the foregoing events; labor disputes, strikes, slow-downs, or other formsof labor or union activity; and pressure from third-party interest groups;  changes in Abbott's business units and investments and changes in the relative and absolute contribution of each to earnings and cashflow resulting from evolving business strategies, changing product mix, changes in tax laws or tax rates both in the U.S. and abroad and opportunities existing now or in the future;   changes in the buying patterns of a major distributor, retailer, or wholesale customer resulting from buyer purchasing decisions,pricing, seasonality, or other factors, or other problems with licensors, suppliers, distributors, and business partners;  changes in credit markets impacting Abbott's ability to obtain financing for its business operations; and   legal difficulties, any of which could preclude or delay commercialization of products or adversely affect profitability, includingclaims asserting statutory or regulatory violations, and adverse litigation decisions. 13     CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS             This Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that are based on management's current expectations, estimates, andprojections.

13,ABT,ABBOTT LABORATORIES,2014-02-21,"ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS             In addition to the other information in this report, the following risk factors should be considered before deciding to invest in anyof Abbott's securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to Abbott, or risks Abbott currently considers immaterial, could also affect Abbott's actual results. Abbott's business,financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.  Abbott may acquire other businesses, license rights to technologies or products, form alliances, or dispose of or spin-off businesses, which could cause it to incursignificant expenses and could negatively affect profitability.          Abbott may pursue acquisitions, licensing arrangements, and strategic alliances, or dispose of or spin-off some of its businesses, aspart of its business strategy. Abbott may not complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and may not realize the expected benefits. If Abbott is successfulin making an acquisition, the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources andinvestments than originally anticipated. Abbott may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingentliabilities. Abbott could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or disposition-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles andcharges for impairment of long-term assets. These effects could cause a deterioration of Abbott's credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense.  Abbott is subject to cost containment efforts that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operating income.          In the United States and other countries, Abbott's businesses have experienced downward pressure on product pricing.

Any of these events coulddisrupt Abbott's business and have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues, profitability and financial condition.  Laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on Abbott, require Abbott to change its business practices, and restrict itsoperations in the future.          Abbott's industry is subject to various international, supranational, federal, and state laws and regulations pertaining to governmentbenefit program reimbursement, price reporting and regulation, and health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback and false claims laws, and international and individual state laws relating topricing and sales and marketing practices. Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, substantial fines, imprisonment, and exclusionfrom participation in government health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and Veterans Administration health programs in the U.S. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and they aresubject to evolving interpretations, which could require Abbott to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices.

This could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause,similar losses with respect to other batches or products. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred. To theextent Abbott or one of its suppliers experiences significant manufacturing problems, this could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues and profitability.  Significant safety concerns could arise for Abbott's products, which could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues and financial condition.          Health care products typically receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration.Following regulatory approval, these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients. Investigators may also conduct additional, and perhaps more extensive, 11 studies.If new safety issues are reported, Abbott may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product. For example, Abbott may be required to provide additional warnings on a product's labelor narrow its approved intended use, either of which could reduce the product's market acceptance. If serious safety issues arise with an Abbott product, sales of the product could be halted by Abbottor by regulatory authorities. Safety issues affecting suppliers' or competitors' products also may reduce the market acceptance of Abbott's products.         Inaddition, in the ordinary course of business, Abbott is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that its products or the products of other companies that Abbottpromotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for or injury to patients. Product liability claims and lawsuits, safety alerts or product recalls, and other allegations of productsafety or quality issues, regardless of their validity or ultimate outcome, may have a material adverse effect on Abbott's business and reputation and on Abbott's ability to attract and retaincustomers. Consequences may also include additional costs, a decrease in market share for the products, lower income or exposure to other claims. Product liability losses are self-insured. Productliability claims could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's profitability and financial condition.  Deterioration in the economic position and credit quality of certain countries may negatively affect Abbott's results of operations.          Unfavorable economic conditions in certain countries may increase the time it takes to collect outstanding trade receivables. Financialinstability and fiscal deficits in these countries may result in additional austerity measures to reduce costs, including health care. Deterioration in the quality of sovereign debt, including creditdowngrades, could increase Abbott's collection risk where a significant amount of Abbott's receivables in these countries are with governmental health care systems.  Abbott depends on sophisticated information technology systems to operate its business and a cyber attack or other breach of these systems could have a material adverseeffect on Abbott's results of operations.          Similar to other large multi-national companies, the size and complexity of Abbott's information technology systems makes themvulnerable to a cyber attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy, or other significant disruption. Abbott's systems have been and are expected to continue to be thetarget of malware and other cyber attacks. Abbott has invested in its systems and the protection of its data to reduce the risk of an invasion or interruption and monitors its systems on an ongoingbasis for any current or potential threats. There can be no assurance that these measures and efforts will prevent future interruptions or breakdowns that could have a significant effect on Abbott'sbusiness.  Abbott may incur operational difficulties or be exposed to claims and liabilities as a result of the separation.          AbbVie and Abbott entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements to govern the separation of AbbViefrom Abbott and the relationship between the two companies going forward. Certain of these agreements provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a periodof time. If AbbVie is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements, including its indemnification obligations, Abbott could incur operational difficulties or losses. These arrangementscould also lead to disputes between Abbott and AbbVie over Abbott's rights to certain shared property and rights and over the allocation of costs and revenues for products and operations.         Theseparation and distribution agreement also provides for, among other things, indemnification obligations designed to make AbbVie financially responsible for substantially allliabilities that may exist relating to its business activities, whether incurred prior to or after AbbVie's separation from Abbott, as well as those obligations of Abbott assumed by AbbVie pursuant tothe separation and distribution 12 agreement.It is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between Abbott and AbbVie and require Abbott to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to AbbVie. Third partiescould also seek to hold Abbott responsible for any of these liabilities or obligations. The indemnity rights Abbott has under the separation agreement may not be sufficient to protect Abbott. Even ifAbbott is successful in obtaining indemnification, Abbott may have to bear losses temporarily. Inaddition, Abbott's indemnity obligations to AbbVie may be significant. These risks could negatively affect Abbott's results of operations.  There could be significant liability if the distribution of AbbVie common stock to Abbott shareholders is determined to be a taxable transaction.          Abbott received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to the effect that, among other things, the separationand the distribution of AbbVie qualifies as a transaction that is tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code (the Code). Inaddition, Abbott received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the separation and distribution qualifies as a transaction that is described in Sections 355(a) and 368(a)(1)(D)of the Code. The ruling and the opinion rely on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from Abbott and AbbVie regarding the past and future conduct of the companies' respectivebusinesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied, Abbott and its shareholders may not be able to rely on the ruling orthe opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the receipt by Abbott of the private letter ruling from the IRS and opinion of tax counsel, the IRScould determine on audit that the separation is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagreeswith the conclusions in the opinion that are not covered by the private letter ruling, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in the share ownership of Abbott orAbbVie after the separation. If the separation is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Abbott and its shareholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incursignificant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.  The international nature of Abbott's business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause its revenue and profitability to decline.          Abbott's business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Sales outside of the United States make upapproximately 70 percent of Abbott's net sales. Additional risks associated with Abbott's international operations include:fluctuations in currency exchange rates; differing local product preferences and product requirements; trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; difficulty in establishing, staffing, and managing operations; differing labor regulations; potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;  political and economic instability, including sovereign debt issues; price and currency exchange controls, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization,and other governmental action; inflation, recession, and fluctuations in interest rates; compulsory licensing or diminished protection of intellectual property; and 13 potential penalties or other adverse consequences for violations of anti-corruption, anti-bribery, and other similar lawsand regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. Eventscontemplated by these risks may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues and profitability.  Other factors can have a material adverse effect on Abbott's future profitability and financial condition.          Many other factors can affect Abbott's profitability and its financial condition,including:changes in or interpretations of laws and regulations, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements,product marketing application standards, product labeling, source and use laws, and environmental laws; differences between the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and their actual value, particularly forpensions, retiree health care, stock compensation, intangibles, and goodwill; and for contingent liabilities such as litigation, the absence of a recorded amount, or an amount recorded at the minimum,compared to the actual amount; changes in the rate of inflation (including the cost of raw materials, commodities, and supplies), interest rates, marketvalue of Abbott's equity investments, and the performance of investments held by Abbott or Abbott's employee benefit trusts; changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties that transact business with or provide services to Abbott or Abbott'semployee benefit trusts; changes in business, economic, and political conditions, including: war, political instability, terrorist attacks, thethreat of future terrorist activity and related military action; natural disasters; the cost and availability of insurance due to any of the foregoing events; labor disputes, strikes, slow-downs, orother forms of labor or union activity; and pressure from third-party interest groups; changes in Abbott's business units and investments and changes in the relative and absolute contribution of each toearnings and cash flow resulting from evolving business strategies, changing product mix, changes in tax laws or tax rates both in the U.S. and abroad and opportunities existing now or in the future;  changes in the buying patterns of a major distributor, retailer, or wholesale customer resulting from buyer purchasingdecisions, pricing, seasonality, or other factors, or other problems with licensors, suppliers, distributors, and business partners; changes in credit markets impacting Abbott's ability to obtain financing for its business operations; and  legal difficulties, any of which could preclude or delay commercialization of products or adversely affect profitability,including claims asserting statutory or regulatory violations, and adverse litigation decisions.

8,ABT,ABBOTT LABORATORIES,2013-02-15,"ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS             In addition to the other information in this report, the following risk factors should be considered before deciding to invest in anyof Abbott's securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to Abbott, or risks Abbott currently considers immaterial, could also affect Abbott's actual results. Abbott's business,financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.  Abbott may acquire other businesses, license rights to technologies or products, form alliances, or dispose of or spin-off businesses, which could cause it toincur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability.          Abbott may pursue acquisitions, technology licensing arrangements, and strategic alliances, or dispose of or spin-off someof its businesses, as part of its business strategy. Abbott may not complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and may not realize the expectedbenefits. If Abbott is successful in making an acquisition, the products and technologies that are acquired may not besuccessful or may require significantly greater resources and investments than originally anticipated. Abbott may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business andcould incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities. Abbott could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition ordisposition-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of long-term assets. These effects could cause a deterioration of Abbott's creditrating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense.  The expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may affect Abbott's future revenues and operating income.          Many of Abbott's businesses rely on patent and trademark and other intellectual property protection. Although most of the challenges toAbbott's intellectual property have come from other businesses, governments may also challenge intellectual property protections. To the extent Abbott's intellectual property is successfullychallenged, invalidated, or circumvented or to the extent it does not allow Abbott to compete effectively, Abbott's business will suffer. To the extent that countries do not enforce Abbott'sintellectual property rights or to the extent that countries require compulsory licensing of its intellectual property, Abbott's future revenues and operating income will be reduced. Abbott's patentsand trademarks are described in greater detail in the section captioned ""Patents, Trademarks, and Licenses,"" and litigation regarding these patents is described in the section captioned ""LegalProceedings.""  Competitors' intellectual property may prevent Abbott from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on Abbott's future profitability and financial condition.          Competitors may claim that an Abbott product infringes upon their intellectual property. Resolving an intellectual propertyinfringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require Abbott to enter into license agreements. Abbott cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commerciallyreasonable terms. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject Abbott to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture, sale or use ofaffected Abbott products. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's profitability and financial condition.  Abbott is subject to cost containment efforts that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operating income.          In the United States and other countries, Abbott's businesses have experienced downward pressure on product pricing. Cost containmentefforts by governments and private organizations are described in 10 greaterdetail in the section captioned ""Regulation."" To the extent these cost containment efforts are not offset by greater patient access to health care or other factors, Abbott's future revenuesand operating income will be reduced.  Abbott is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes.          Abbott's products are subject to rigorous regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and numerous international,supranational, federal, and state authorities. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a drug or medical device can be costly and time-consuming, and approvals might not begranted for future products, or additional indications or uses of existing products, on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in the receipt of, or failure to obtain approvals for, future products, or newindications and uses, could result in delayed realization of product revenues, reduction in revenues, and in substantial additional costs.         Inaddition, no assurance can be given that Abbott will remain in compliance with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements once clearance or approval has been obtained for aproduct. These requirements include, among other things, regulations regarding manufacturing practices, product labeling, and advertising and postmarketing reporting, including adverse event reportsand field alerts due to manufacturing quality concerns. Many of Abbott's facilities and procedures and those of Abbott's suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation, including periodic inspection bythe FDA and other regulatory authorities. Abbott must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations. Possible regulatory actions fornon-compliance could include warning letters, fines, damages, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls, seizures of Abbott's products, and criminal prosecution. These actions could result in,among other things, substantial modifications to Abbott's business practices and operations; refunds, recalls, or seizures of Abbott's products; a total or partial shutdown of production in one ormore of Abbott's facilities while Abbott or Abbott's suppliers remedy the alleged violation; the inability to obtain future pre-market clearances or approvals; and withdrawals orsuspensions of current products from the market. Any of these events could disrupt Abbott's business and have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues, profitability and financial condition.  Laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on Abbott, require Abbott to change its business practices, and restrict itsoperations in the future.          Abbott's industry is also subject to various federal, state, and international laws and regulations pertaining to government benefitprogram reimbursement, price reporting and regulation, and health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback and false claims laws, and international and individual state laws relatingto pricing and sales and marketing practices. Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances, substantial fines, imprisonment, andexclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and Veterans Administration health programs. These laws and regulations are broad in scope andthey are subject to evolving interpretations, which could require Abbott to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its sales or marketing practices. In addition,violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt Abbott's business and result in a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues, profitability, and financial condition.  Changes in the health care regulatory environment may adversely affect Abbott's business.          A number of the provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of2010 require further rulemaking action by governmental agencies to implement. The laws change access to health care products and services and create new fees for the pharmaceutical and medical deviceindustries. Future rulemaking could increase rebates, reduce prices or 11 therate of price increases for health care products and services, or require additional reporting and disclosure. Abbott cannot predict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking.  Abbott's research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and technologies, which may cause Abbott's revenue and profitabilityto decline.          To remain competitive, Abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies. To accomplish this, Abbott commits substantialefforts, funds, and other resources to research and development. A high rate of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies. Abbott must make ongoingsubstantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including after significant funds have been invested.         Promisingnew product candidates may fail to reach the market or may only have limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achieve positive clinicaloutcomes, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, limited scope of approved uses, excessive costs to manufacture, the failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights, orinfringement of the intellectual property rights of others. Even if Abbott successfully develops new products or enhancements or new generations of Abbott's existing products, they may be quicklyrendered obsolete by changing customer preferences, changing industry standards, or competitors' innovations. Innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of, among other things,entrenched patterns of clinical practice or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Abbott cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched,whether it will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire compounds or products, or whether any products will be commercially successful. Failure to launch successful new products or newindications for existing products may cause Abbott's products to become obsolete, causing Abbott's revenues and operating results to suffer.  New products and technological advances by Abbott's competitors may negatively affect Abbott's results of operations.          Abbott's products face intense competition from its competitors' products. Competitors' products may be safer, more effective, moreeffectively marketed or sold, or have lower prices or superior performance features than Abbott's products. Abbott cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction ofcompetitors' products.  The manufacture of many of Abbott's products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if Abbott or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing products,Abbott's business could suffer.          The manufacture of many of Abbott's products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements.Problems may arise duringmanufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, natural disasters, and environmental factors.In addition, single suppliers are currently used for certain products and materials. If problems arise during the production of a batch of product, that batch of product may have to be discarded. Thiscould, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause, similar losses with respectto other batches or products. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred. To the extent Abbott or one of itssuppliers experiences significant manufacturing problems, this could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues and profitability. 12  Significant safety issues could arise for Abbott's products, which could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues and financial condition.          Health care products typically receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration.Following regulatory approval, these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients. Investigators may also conduct additional, and perhaps more extensive, studies. If new safetyissues are reported, Abbott may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product. For example, Abbott may be required to provide additional warnings on a product's label or narrow its approvedintended use, either of which could reduce the product's market acceptance. If serious safety issues arise with an Abbott product, sales of the product could be halted by Abbott or by regulatoryauthorities. Safety issues affecting suppliers' or competitors' products also may reduce the market acceptance of Abbott's products.         Inaddition, in the ordinary course of business, Abbott is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that its products or the products of other companies that Abbottpromotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for or injury to patients. Product liability claims and lawsuits and safety alerts or product recalls, regardless of their validity orultimate outcome, may have a material adverse effect on Abbott's business and reputation and on Abbott's ability to attract and retain customers. Consequences may also include additional costs, adecrease in market share for the products, lower income or exposure to other claims. Product liability losses are self-insured. Product liability claims could have a material adverseeffect on Abbott's profitability and financial condition.  Further deterioration in the economic position and credit quality of certain European countries may negatively affect Abbott's results of operations.          If economic conditions in certain European countries, including Greece, Portugal, Italy, and Spain, continue to worsen, the time ittakes to collect outstanding trade receivables may increase. Financial instability and fiscal deficits in these countries may result in additional austerity measures to reduce costs, including healthcare. At the same time, ongoing sovereign debt issues, including the impact of credit downgrades, could increase Abbott's collection risk given that a significant amount of Abbott's receivables inthese countries are with governmental health care systems.  Abbott depends on sophisticated information technology systems to operate its business and a cyber attack or other breach of these systems could have a material adverseeffect on Abbott's results of operations.          Similar to other large multi-national companies, the size and complexity of Abbott's information technology systems makes themvulnerable to a cyber attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy, or other significant disruption. Abbott's systems have been and are expected to continue to be thetarget of malware and other cyber attacks. Abbott has invested in its systems and the protection of its data to reduce the risk of an invasion or interruption and monitors its systems on an ongoingbasis for any current or potential threats. There can be no assurance that these measures and efforts will prevent future interruptions or breakdowns that could have a significant effect on Abbott'sbusiness.  Abbott may incur operational difficulties or be exposed to claims and liabilities as a result of the separation.          AbbVie and Abbott entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements to govern the separation of AbbViefrom Abbott and the relationship between the two companies going forward. Certain of these agreements provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a periodof time. If AbbVie is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements, including its indemnification obligations, Abbott could incur operational difficulties or losses. These arrangementscould also lead to disputes between Abbott and AbbVie over 13 Abbott'srights to certain shared property and rights and over the allocation of costs and revenues for products and operations.         Theseparation and distribution agreement also provides for, among other things, indemnification obligations designed to make AbbVie financially responsible for substantially allliabilities that may exist relating to its business activities, whether incurred prior to or after AbbVie's separation from Abbott, as well as those obligations of Abbott assumed by AbbVie pursuant tothe separation and distribution agreement. It is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between Abbott and AbbVie and require Abbott to assume responsibility for obligationsallocated to AbbVie. Third parties could also seek to hold Abbott responsible for any of these liabilities or obligations. The indemnity rights Abbott has under the separation agreement may not besufficient to protect Abbott. Even if Abbott is successful in obtaining indemnification, Abbott may have to bear losses temporarily. In addition, Abbott's indemnity obligations to AbbVie may besignificant. These risks could negatively affect Abbott's results of operations.  There could be significant liability if the distribution of AbbVie common stock to Abbott shareholders is determined to be a taxable transaction.          Abbott received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to the effect that, among other things, the separationand the distribution of AbbVie qualifies as a transaction that is tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code (theCode). In addition, Abbott received an opinion from outside tax counsel to the effect that the separation and distribution qualifies as a transaction that is described in Sections 355(a) and368(a)(1)(D) of the Code. The ruling and the opinion rely on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings from Abbott and AbbVie regarding the past and future conduct of the companies'respective businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied, Abbott and its shareholders may not be able to rely on theruling or the opinion of tax counsel and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the receipt by Abbott of the private letter ruling from the IRS and opinion of tax counsel,the IRS could determine on audit that the separation is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if itdisagrees with the conclusions in the opinion that are not covered by the private letter ruling, or for other reasons, including as a result of certain significant changes in the share ownership ofAbbott or AbbVie after the separation. If the separation is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Abbott and its shareholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax couldincur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities.  The international nature of Abbott's business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause its revenue and profitability to decline.          Abbott's business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Following the separation of AbbVie, sales outsideof the United States are expected to make up approximately 70 percent of Abbott's net sales. The risks associated with Abbott's operations outside the United Statesinclude:fluctuations in currency exchange rates; changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs; multiple regulatory requirements that are subject to change and that could restrict Abbott's ability to manufacture,market, and sell its products; differing local product preferences and product requirements; trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; difficulty in establishing, staffing, and managing operations; 14 differing labor regulations; potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;  political and economic instability, including sovereign debt issues; price and currency exchange controls, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization,and other governmental action; inflation, recession and fluctuations in interest rates; compulsory licensing or diminished protection of intellectual property; and  potential penalties or other adverse consequences for violations of anti-corruption, anti-briberyand other similar laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act. Eventscontemplated by these risks may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues and profitability.  Other factors can have a material adverse effect on Abbott's future profitability and financial condition.          Many other factors can affect Abbott's profitability and its financial condition,including:changes in or interpretations of laws and regulations, including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements,product marketing application standards, product labeling, source, and use laws, and environmental laws; differences between the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and their actual value, particularly forpensions, retiree health care, stock compensation, intangibles, and goodwill; and for contingent liabilities such as litigation, the absence of a recorded amount, or an amount recorded at the minimum,compared to the actual amount; changes in the rate of inflation (including the cost of raw materials, commodities, and supplies), interest rates, marketvalue of Abbott's equity investments, and the performance of investments held by Abbott or Abbott's employee benefit trusts; changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties that transact business with or provide services to Abbott or Abbott'semployee benefit trusts; changes in business, economic, and political conditions, including: war, political instability, terrorist attacks, thethreat of future terrorist activity and related military action; natural disasters; the cost and availability of insurance due to any of the foregoing events; labor disputes, strikes,slow-downs, or other forms of labor or union activity; and pressure from third-party interest groups; changes in Abbott's business units and investments and changes in the relative and absolute contribution of each toearnings and cash flow resulting from evolving business strategies, changing product mix, changes in tax laws or tax rates both in the U.S. and abroad and opportunities existing now or in the future;  changes in the buying patterns of a major distributor, retailer, or wholesale customer resulting from buyer purchasingdecisions, pricing, seasonality, or other factors, or other problems with licensors, suppliers, distributors, and business partners; changes in credit markets impacting Abbott's ability to obtain financing for its business operations; and 15 legal difficulties, any of which could preclude or delay commercialization of products or adversely affect profitability,including claims asserting statutory or regulatory violations, and adverse litigation decisions.

12,ABT,ABBOTT LABORATORIES,2012-02-21,"ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS             In addition to the other information in this report, the following risk factors should be considered before deciding to invest in anyof Abbott's securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to Abbott, or risks Abbott currently considers immaterial, could also affect Abbott's actual results. Abbott's business,financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks.  Abbott may acquire other businesses, license rights to technologies or products, form alliances, or dispose of or spin-off businesses, which could cause it toincur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability.          Abbott may pursue acquisitions, technology licensing arrangements, and strategic alliances, or dispose of or spin-off someof its businesses, as part of its business strategy. Abbott may not complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and may not realize the expectedbenefits. If Abbott is successful in making an acquisition, the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments thanoriginally anticipated. Abbott may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities.Abbott could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or disposition-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges forimpairment of long-term assets. These effects could cause a deterioration of Abbott's credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense.  The expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may affect Abbott's future revenues and operating income.          Many of Abbott's businesses rely on patent and trademark and other intellectual property protection. Although most of the challenges toAbbott's intellectual property have come from other businesses, governments may also challenge intellectual property protections. To the extent Abbott's intellectual property is successfullychallenged, invalidated, or circumvented or to the extent it does not allow Abbott to compete effectively, Abbott's business will suffer. To the extent that countries do not enforce Abbott'sintellectual property rights or to the extent that countries require compulsory licensing of its intellectual property, Abbott's future revenues and operating income will be reduced. Abbott'sprincipal patents and trademarks are described in greater detail in the sections captioned, ""Patents, Trademarks, and Licenses"" and ""Financial Review,"" and litigation regarding these patents isdescribed in the section captioned ""Legal Proceedings.""         Abbottfaces increasing competition from lower-cost generic products. The expiration or loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by genericsubstitutes that may significantly reduce Abbott's sales for that product in a short amount of time. If Abbott's competitive position is compromised because of generics or otherwise, it could have amaterial adverse effect on its revenues, margins, business, and results of operations.  Competitors' intellectual property may prevent Abbott from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on Abbott's future profitability and financial condition.          Competitors may claim that an Abbott product infringes upon their intellectual property. Resolving an intellectual propertyinfringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require Abbott to enter into license agreements. Abbott cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commerciallyreasonable terms. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject Abbott to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture, sale or use of 10 Table of ContentsaffectedAbbott products. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's profitability and financial condition.  Abbott is subject to cost-containment efforts that could cause a reduction in future revenues and operating income.          In the United States and other countries, Abbott's businesses have experienced downward pressure on product pricing.Cost-containment efforts by governments and private organizations are described in greater detail in the section captioned ""Regulation."" To the extent these cost containment efforts arenot offset by greater patient access to healthcare or other factors, Abbott's future revenues and operating income will be reduced.  Abbott is subject to numerous governmental regulations and it can be costly to comply with these regulations and to develop compliant products and processes.          Abbott's products are subject to rigorous regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and numerous international,supranational, federal, and state authorities. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals to market a drug or medical device can be costly and time-consuming, and approvals might not begranted for future products, or additional indications or uses of existing products, on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in the receipt of, or failure to obtain approvals for, future products, or newindications and uses, could result in delayed realization of product revenues, reduction in revenues, and in substantial additional costs.         Inaddition, no assurance can be given that Abbott will remain in compliance with applicable FDA and other regulatory requirements once clearance or approval has been obtained for aproduct. These requirements include, among other things, regulations regarding manufacturing practices, product labeling, and advertising and postmarketing reporting, including adverse event reportsand field alerts due to manufacturing quality concerns. Many of Abbott's facilities and procedures and those of Abbott's suppliers are subject to ongoing regulation, including periodic inspection bythe FDA and other regulatory authorities. Abbott must incur expense and spend time and effort to ensure compliance with these complex regulations. Possible regulatory actions could include warningletters, fines, damages, injunctions, civil penalties, recalls, seizures of Abbott's products, and criminal prosecution. These actions could result in, among other things, substantial modifications toAbbott's business practices and operations; refunds, recalls, or seizures of Abbott's products; a total or partial shutdown of production in one or more of Abbott's facilities while Abbott or Abbott'ssuppliers remedy the alleged violation; the inability to obtain future pre-market clearances or approvals; and withdrawals or suspensions of current products from the market. Any of theseevents could disrupt Abbott's business and have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues, profitability and financial condition.  Laws and regulations affecting government benefit programs could impose new obligations on Abbott, require Abbott to change its business practices, and restrict itsoperations in the future.          Abbott's industry is also subject to various federal, state, and international laws and regulations pertaining to government benefitprogram reimbursement, price reporting and regulation, and health care fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback and false claims laws, the Medicaid Rebate Statute, the Veterans Health CareAct, and individual state laws relating to pricing and sales and marketing practices. Violations of these laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including, in some instances,substantial fines, imprisonment, and exclusion from participation in federal and state health care programs, including Medicare, Medicaid, and Veterans Administration health programs. These laws andregulations are broad in scope and they are subject to evolving interpretations, which could require Abbott to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of its salesor marketing practices. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt Abbott's business and result in a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues,profitability, and financial condition. 11 Table of Contents Changes in the health care regulatory environment may adversely affect Abbott's business.          A number of the provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of2010 require further rulemaking action by governmental agencies to implement. The laws change access to health care products and services and create new fees for the pharmaceutical and medical deviceindustries. Future rulemaking could increase rebates, reduce prices or the rate of price increases for health care products and services, or require additional reporting and disclosure. Abbott cannotpredict the timing or impact of any future rulemaking.  Abbott's research and development efforts may not succeed in developing commercially successful products and technologies, which may cause Abbott's revenue and profitabilityto decline.          To remain competitive, Abbott must continue to launch new products and technologies. To accomplish this, Abbott commits substantialefforts, funds, and other resources to research and development. A high rate of failure is inherent in the research and development of new products and technologies. Abbott must make ongoingsubstantial expenditures without any assurance that its efforts will be commercially successful. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including after significant funds have been invested.         Promisingnew product candidates may fail to reach the market or may only have limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achieve positive clinicaloutcomes, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, limited scope of approved uses, excessive costs to manufacture, the failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights, orinfringement of the intellectual property rights of others. Even if Abbott successfully develops new products or enhancements or new generations of Abbott's existing products, they may be quicklyrendered obsolete by changing customer preferences, changing industry standards, or competitors' innovations. Innovations may not be accepted quickly in the marketplace because of, among other things,entrenched patterns of clinical practice or uncertainty over third-party reimbursement. Abbott cannot state with certainty when or whether any of its products under development will be launched,whether it will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire compounds or products, or whether any products will be commercially successful. Failure to launch successful new products or newindications for existing products may cause Abbott's products to become obsolete, causing Abbott's revenues and operating results to suffer.  The proposed separation of Abbott into two publicly-traded companies may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline or terms, or at all, and may not achieve theintended benefits.          Unforeseen developments, including possible delays in obtaining various tax, regulatory and works council approvals or clearances,could delay or prevent the proposed separation or cause the proposed separation to occur on terms or conditions that are less favorable and/or different than expected. Expenses incurred to accomplishthe proposed separation may be significantly higher than Abbott currently anticipates. Following the proposed separation, the combined value of the common stock of the two publicly-traded companiesmay not be equal to or greater than what the value of Abbott's common stock would have been had the proposed separation not occurred.  New products and technological advances by Abbott's competitors may negatively affect Abbott's results of operations.          Abbott's products face intense competition from its competitors' products. Competitors' products may be safer, more effective, moreeffectively marketed or sold, or have lower prices or superior performance features than Abbott's products. Abbott cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of the introduction ofcompetitors' products. 12 Table of Contents The manufacture of many of Abbott's products is a highly exacting and complex process, and if Abbott or one of its suppliers encounters problems manufacturing products,Abbott's business could suffer.          The manufacture of many of Abbott's products is a highly exacting and complex process, due in part to strict regulatory requirements.Problems may arise during manufacturing for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, natural disasters,and environmental factors. In addition, single suppliers are currently used for certain products and materials. If problems arise during the production of a batch of product, that batch of product mayhave to be discarded. This could, among other things, lead to increased costs, lost revenue, damage to customer relations, time and expense spent investigating the cause and, depending on the cause,similar losses with respect to other batches or products. If problems are not discovered before the product is released to the market, recall and product liability costs may also be incurred. To theextent Abbott or one of its suppliersexperiences significant manufacturing problems, this could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues and profitability.  Significant safety issues could arise for Abbott's products, which could have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues and financial condition.          Health care products typically receive regulatory approval based on data obtained in controlled clinical trials of limited duration.Following regulatory approval, these products will be used over longer periods of time in many patients. Investigators may also conduct additional, and perhaps more extensive, studies. If new safetyissues are reported, Abbott may be required to amend the conditions of use for a product. For example, Abbott may be required to provide additional warnings on a product's label or narrow its approvedintended use, either of which could reduce the product's market acceptance. If serious safety issues arise with an Abbott product, sales of the product could be halted by Abbott or by regulatoryauthorities. Safety issues affecting suppliers' or competitors' products also may reduce the market acceptance of Abbott's products.         Inaddition, in the ordinary course of business, Abbott is the subject of product liability claims and lawsuits alleging that its products or the products of other companies that Abbottpromotes have resulted or could result in an unsafe condition for or injury to patients. Product liability claims and lawsuits and safety alerts or product recalls, regardless of their ultimateoutcome, may have a material adverse effect on Abbott's business and reputation and on Abbott's ability to attract and retain customers. Consequences may also include additional costs, a decrease inmarket share for the products, lower income or exposure to other claims. Product liability losses are generally self-insured. Product liability claims could have a material adverse effecton Abbott's profitability and financial condition.  Further deterioration in the economic position and credit quality of certain European countries may negatively affect Abbott's results of operations.          If economic conditions in certain European countries, including Greece, Portugal, Italy, and Spain, continue to worsen, the time ittakes to collect outstanding trade receivables may increase. Financial instability and fiscal deficits in these countries may result in additional austerity measures to reduce costs, including healthcare. At the same time, ongoing sovereign debt issues, including the impact of recent credit downgrades, could increase Abbott's collection risk given that a significant amount of Abbott's receivablesin these countries are with governmental health care systems. 13 Table of Contents The international nature of Abbott's business subjects it to additional business risks that may cause its revenue and profitability to decline.          Abbott's business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Sales outside of the United States make upapproximately 60 percent of Abbott's net sales. The risks associated with Abbott's operations outside the United States include:changes in medical reimbursement policies and programs; multiple regulatory requirements that are subject to change and that could restrict Abbott's ability to manufacture,market, and sell its products; differing local product preferences and product requirements; trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements; difficulty in establishing, staffing, and managing operations; differing labor regulations; potentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;  political and economic instability, including sovereign debt issues; price and currency exchange controls, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization,and other governmental action; inflation, recession and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates; and  compulsory licensing or diminished protection of intellectual property. Theserisks may, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on Abbott's revenues and profitability.  Other factors can have a material adverse effect on Abbott's future profitability and financial condition.          Many other factors can affect Abbott's profitability and its financial condition,including:Differences between the fair value measurement of assets and liabilities and their actual value, particularly forpensions, retiree health care, stock compensation, intangibles, and goodwill; and for contingent liabilities such as litigation, the absence of a recorded amount, or an amount recorded at the minimum,compared to the actual amount. Changes in or interpretations of laws and regulations including changes in accounting standards, taxation requirements,product marketing application standards, and environmental laws in domestic or foreign jurisdictions. Changes in the rate of inflation (including the cost of raw materials, commodities, and supplies), interest rates, marketvalue of Abbott's equity investments, and the performance of investments held by Abbott or Abbott's employee benefit trusts. Changes in the creditworthiness of counterparties that transact business with or provide services to Abbott or Abbott'semployee benefit trusts. Changes in business, economic, and political conditions, including: war, political instability, terrorist attacks in theU.S. and other parts of the world, the threat of future terrorist activity in the U.S. and other parts of the world and related military action; natural disasters; the cost and availability ofinsurance due to any of the foregoing events; labor disputes, strikes, slow-downs, or other forms of labor or union activity; and pressure from third-party interest groups. 14 Table of ContentsChanges in Abbott's business units and investments and changes in the relative and absolute contribution of each toearnings and cash flow resulting from evolving business strategies, changing product mix, changes in tax laws or tax rates both in the U.S. and abroad and opportunities existing now or in the future.  Changes in the buying patterns of a major distributor, retailer, or wholesale customer resulting from buyer purchasingdecisions, pricing, seasonality, or other factors, or other problems with licensors, suppliers, distributors, and business partners. Difficulties related to Abbott's information technology systems, any of which could adversely affect business operations,including any significant breakdown, invasion, destruction, loss of data privacy, or interruption of these systems. Changes in credit markets impacting Abbott's ability to obtain financing for its business operations.  Legal difficulties, any of which could preclude or delay commercialization of products or adversely affect profitability,including claims asserting statutory or regulatory violations, adverse litigation decisions, and issues regarding compliance with any governmental consent decree or agreements.

2,ABT,ABBOTT LABORATORIES,2011-02-18,"ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS             In addition to the other information in this report, the following risk factors should be considered before deciding to invest in anyof Abbott's securities. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to Abbott, or risks Abbott currently considers immaterial, could also affect Abbott's actual results. Abbott's business,financial condition, results of operations, or prospects could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. Abbott may acquire other businesses, license rights to technologies or products, form alliances, or dispose of or spin-off businesses,which could cause it to incur significant expenses and could negatively affect profitability.          Abbott may pursue acquisitions, technology licensing arrangements, and strategic alliances, or dispose of or spin-off someof its businesses, as part of its business strategy. Abbott may not complete these transactions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis, or at all, and may not realize the expectedbenefits. If Abbott is successful in making an acquisition, the products and technologies that are acquired may not be successful or may require significantly greater resources and investments thanoriginally anticipated. Abbott may not be able to integrate acquisitions successfully into its existing business and could incur or assume significant debt and unknown or contingent liabilities.Abbott could also experience negative effects on its reported results of operations from acquisition or disposition-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges forimpairment of long-term assets. These effects could cause a deterioration of Abbott's credit rating and result in increased borrowing costs and interest expense. The expiration or loss of patent protection and licenses may affect Abbott's future revenues and operating income.          Many of Abbott's businesses rely on patent and trademark and other intellectual property protection. Although most of the challenges toAbbott's intellectual property have come from other businesses, governments may also challenge intellectual property protections. To the extent Abbott's intellectual property is successfullychallenged, invalidated, or circumvented or to the extent it does not allow Abbott to compete effectively, Abbott's business will suffer. To the extent that countries do not enforce Abbott'sintellectual property rights or to the extent that countries require compulsory licensing of its intellectual property, Abbott's future revenues and operating income will be reduced. Abbott'sprincipal patents and trademarks are described in greater detail in the sections captioned, ""Patents, Trademarks, and Licenses"" and ""Financial Review,"" and litigation regarding these patents isdescribed in the section captioned ""Legal Proceedings.""         Abbottfaces increasing competition from lower-cost generic products. The expiration or loss of patent protection for a product typically is followed promptly by genericsubstitutes that may significantly reduce Abbott's sales for that product in a short amount of time. If Abbott's competitive position is compromised because of generics or otherwise, it could have amaterial adverse effect on its revenues, margins, business, and results of operations. Competitors' intellectual property may prevent Abbott from selling its products or have a material adverse effect on Abbott's future profitabilityand financial condition.          Competitors may claim that an Abbott product infringes upon their intellectual property. Resolving an intellectual propertyinfringement claim can be costly and time consuming and may require Abbott to enter into license agreements. Abbott cannot guarantee that it would be able to obtain license agreements on commerciallyreasonable terms. A successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement could subject Abbott to significant damages or an injunction preventing the manufacture, sale or use of 9 Table of ContentsaffectedAbbott products.
