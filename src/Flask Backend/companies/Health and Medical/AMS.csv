RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information in this report, the following factors could affect our future business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position, and could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in any of the forward-looking statements contained in this report.       11     Table of Contents Company, Industry and Economic Risk If the Company is not successful at diversifying its business model, its revenues and profitability may decline. The Company has historically relied on Gamma Knife unit placement and a PBRT system to provide its revenues. Currently, there is a limited market for Gamma Knife equipment and PBRT systems. As a result, we plan to adapt our business model to place other types of stereotactic radiosurgery and advanced radiation therapy equipment in addition to Gamma Knife units and PBRT systems. This will constitute an expanded product mix for the Company and there can be no assurance that we can successfully adapt our historical business model to these new product offerings. If we are not successful, our revenues and profitability could decline substantially as existing contracts expire and are not renewed. The Federal reimbursement rate for Gamma Knife treatments may not provide the Company with an adequate return on its investment. Congress enacted legislation in 2013 that significantly reduced the Medicare reimbursement rate for outpatient Gamma Knife treatment by setting it at the same amount paid for linear accelerator-based radiosurgery treatment. Gamma Knife treatment has been relatively stable during the last five years. There can be no assurance that CMS reimbursement levels will be maintained at levels providing the Company an adequate return on its investment. Any future reductions in the reimbursement rate would adversely affect the Company’s revenues and financial results. The Company's revenue sharing is subject to payor mix variability which could negatively impact the Company's revenue and financial results. The Company’s average reimbursement rate for its revenue sharing and retail customers is dependent on the percentage mix of government associated payors and commercial managed care payors.  Commercial and managed care payors tend to reimburse at a higher level than government payors.  Therefore, a shift in payor mix to a higher level of government payors will reduce the Company’s average reimbursement rate per treatment.  The Company’s capital investment at each site is substantial and the Company may not be able to fully recover its costs or capital investment which could have a material negative impact on its revenues and financial results. Each Gamma Knife, PBRT or advanced LINEAR accelerator device requires a substantial capital investment. In some cases, we contribute additional funds for capital costs and/or annual operating and equipment related costs such as marketing, maintenance, insurance and property taxes. Due to the structure of our contracts with medical centers, there can be no assurance that these costs will be fully recovered or that we will earn a satisfactory return on our investment, which could have a material negative impact on our revenues and financial results.  Additionally, the Company is obligated to remove the equipment at the end of the lease term. In the event the customer does not purchase the equipment from the Company or the Company is not able to trade in the equipment, the Company is required to remove the equipment and record an ARO. The market for the Gamma Knife is limited and the Company may not be able to place additional Gamma Knife units which could negatively impact the Company's revenue and financial results. There is a limited market for the Gamma Knife, and the market in the United States may be mature. The Company has begun and continued operation at only five new Gamma Knife sites in the United States since 2011. Due to the substantial costs of acquiring a Gamma Knife unit, we must identify medical centers that possess neurosurgery and radiation oncology departments capable of performing a large number of Gamma Knife procedures. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in placing additional units at any sites in the future. In recognition of the Gamma Knife's limited growth opportunity, the Company has expanded its product mix to include LINACs, MR LINACs, PET LINACs and is continuing to market PBRT units, but there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in placing these products with customers. The Company’s existing contracts with its customers are fixed in length and there can be no assurance that the customers will wish to extend the contract beyond the end of the term. The Company has incurred debt and may incur additional debt to finance its operations and if the Company is unable to secure additional credit in the future its operations and profits will be negatively impacted. The Company’s business is capital intensive. On April 9, 2021, the Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries entered into a five year $22,000,000 credit agreement with Fifth Third, which refinanced its existing domestic Gamma Knife portfolio.  The lease financing previously obtained by Orlando was also refinanced as long-term debt by the Credit Agreement. On January 25, 2024, the Company and Fifth Third entered into the First Amendment which added an additional $2,700,000 term loan. In June 2020, the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, HoldCo, entered into the DFC Loan in connection with the acquisition of GKCE. The first tranche of the DFC Loan was funded in June 2020. In October 2023, the second tranche of the DFC Loan was funded in the amount of $1,750,000 to finance its equipment upgrade in Ecuador. The Company’s combined long-term debt, net, totaled $13,125,000 as of December 31, 2023. The Credit Agreement is secured by a lien on substantially all of the assets of the Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries and the DFC Loan is secured by a lien on GKCE’s assets. The Credit Agreement includes a $7,000,000 Revolving Line available for future projects and general corporate purposes. The Company borrowed $2,500,000 on the Revolving Line as of December 31, 2023, which was paid off in January 2024. Depending on the Company’s financing requirements and market conditions, the Company may seek to finance its operations by incurring additional long-term debt in the future. The Company’s current level of debt may adversely affect the Company’s ability to secure additional credit in the future, and as a result may affect operations and profitability. If a default on debt occurs in the future, the Company’s creditors would have the ability to accelerate the defaulted loan, to seize the Company’s assets with respect to which default has occurred, and to apply any collateral they may have at the time to cure the default.       12     Table of Contents The Company’s debt agreements contain restrictions that limit its flexibility in operating its business, and the Company may be required to repay the outstanding indebtedness in an event of default, which would have an adverse effect on our business. The Credit Agreement and the DFC Loan contain various covenants that limit the Company’s ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants subject the Company to various restrictions that limit the Company from, among other activities, creating any unpermitted liens to exist on its assets, incurring additional indebtedness, causing a sale of all or substantially all of its assets, effecting a merger, paying dividends or other distributions on capital stock, redeeming shares of capital stock, engaging in transactions with affiliates, or undertaking lease obligations above certain thresholds In addition, the Company is obligated to comply with certain financial-reporting requirements, financial ratios, and liquidity and leverage thresholds under certain covenants in its Credit Agreement and DFC Loan. The Company’s ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial market and industry conditions and the Company cannot give assurance that it will be able to satisfy such ratios and tests when required. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under the Credit Agreement and the DFC Loan. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the lenders could elect to declare the amount outstanding under the Credit Agreement or DFC Loan immediately due and payable. The lenders under the Credit Agreement and the DFC Loan could also exercise their rights to take possession of, and to dispose of, the collateral securing the credit facilities and loans. The Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected as a result of any of those events. The Company may seek to enter into an extension of the credit and loan agreements or to enter into a new facility or loan agreement with another lender. However, the Company may not be able to extend the term or obtain other debt financing on terms that are favorable to the Company, if at all, and the Company could be subject to additional restrictions on its business operations. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on satisfactory terms when required, the Company’s ability to support its business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired, and its business may be harmed. As of December 31, 2023, HoldCo was not in compliance with all of its debt covenants then in effect pursuant to the DFC Loan. However, on March 28, 2024, the Company obtained a waiver for the covenant non-compliance as of December 31, 2023 (the “DFC Waiver”). The Company expects to be compliant with all of its debt covenants by the end of the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2024. However, if a waiver from DFC is required in the future for potential non-compliance, DFC may be unwilling to provide a waiver and could, as a result, among other remedies, accelerate the repayment of the debt obligations oustanding under the DFC Loan, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition. The Company may fail to successfully integrate the interests to be acquired in the RI Acquisition with its existing business in a timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows, or the Company may fail to realize all of the expected benefits of the RI Acquisition, which could negatively impact the Company’s future results of operations. The integration of any acquisitions, including the Company’s planned RI Acquisition, requires significant time and resources. A failure by the Company to successfully integrate the businesses, operations, and contractual obligations of the RI Target Companies with the Company’s existing business in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations. Acquiring majority interests in the RI Target Companies, assuming obligations under the commercial payor contracts set forth in the IPA, and integrating the businesses of the three turn-key radiation therapy cancer centers that the RI Target Companies operate in Rhode Island involves several risks that could undermine the success and expected benefits of the RI Acquisition. Such risks include but are not limited to the following:   ●  the potential difficulty of assimilating the businesses and operations of the RI Target Companies with our existing business and operations;    ●  the added costs that could be incurred from coordinating the integration of personnel from diverse business backgrounds and consolidating the corporate and administrative functions of the Company and the RI Target Companies;    ●  the potential disruption to our existing operations that could result from the Company expanding into another state and expending time and resources to oversee the RI Target Companies’ operation of their three radiation oncology centers;    ●  the added costs and burdens that the Company will incur in connection with obtaining the governmental and regulatory approvals that are necessary to effect the RI Acquisition and to stay regulatorily compliant under Rhode Island law if the RI Acquisition is effected;    ●  the diversion of the resources of the Company and the attention of the Company’s management from the Company’s existing operations and business ventures to the operations of the RI Target Companies, which could hinder the performance of the Company and its subsidiaries;    ●  the potential management differences that could result from the Company gaining majority interests in the RI Target Companies and taking control from GenesisCare; and    ●  the risk of financial loss due to the existing debts and liabilities of the RI Target Companies and the potential need for the Company to expend substantial capital to stabilize the businesses of the RI Target Companies due to any instability created by the GenesisCare bankruptcy, with no guarantee of return on investment.  If the Company is not successful in addressing these risks effectively, the Company’s business and operations could be impaired.       13     Table of Contents The Company’s cash flow could become insufficient to service its debt due to financial, business, and other factors. The Company’s ability to make scheduled payments of the principal and interest on its indebtedness depends on the Company’s financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, and other factors. There can be no assurance that the Company will maintain a level of cash flow from operating activities sufficient to permit it to pay the principal of and any interest on its indebtedness. If the Company’s cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund its debt obligations, the Company may be forced to delay investments and capital expenditures, to seek additional capital, or to restructure or refinance its indebtedness. There can be no guarantee that those alternative measures will be available, either at all or on terms that are favorable to the Company, or that they will be successful even if available in allowing the Company to meet its debt-service obligations. In the absence of such operating results and resources, the Company could experience liquidity issues, which could force the Company to take alternative measures to satisfy its debt obligations, such as selling assets, restructuring debt, or obtaining additional equity capital on potentially onerous or highly dilutive terms. The Credit Agreement and DFC Loan restrict the Company’s ability to dispose of assets and to use the proceeds from such dispositions, so the Company may be restricted from taking certain measures, such as conducting an asset sale, to meet its debt-service obligations. The ability to refinance indebtedness would also depend on the general state of capital markets and on the Company’s financial condition, neither of which can be predicted at this time. A small number of customers account for a major portion of our revenues and the loss of any one of these significant customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and results of operations. A limited number of customers have historically accounted for a substantial portion of the Company’s total revenue, and the Company expects such customer concentration to continue for the foreseeable future. For example, in 2023, one customer in total accounted for approximately 48% of the Company’s revenue. The loss of a significant customer or a significant decline in the business from the Company’s largest customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations. The Company occupies many of its facilities under long-term leases and the Company may not be able to renew its leases at the end of their terms. The Company leases many of the facilities where it holds its equipment. At the end of the lease term for a facility, the Company may be unable to renew the lease without substantial additional costs, if at all. If we are unable to renew our facility leases, we may be required to relocate or close a facility. Additionally, due to the nature of its radiation equipment, there can be a long lead time to prepare space for holding its equipment and substantial cost involved in moving the equipment should the Company need to change locations.  The failure to be able to obtain leased space when required or the costs of relocation could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The market for the Company’s services is competitive and if the Company is not able to compete its business and results of operations could be negatively impacted. The Company estimates that there are two other companies that actively provide alternative, non-conventional Gamma Knife financing to potential customers. The Company’s relationship with Elekta, the manufacturer of the Leksell Gamma Knife unit, is non-exclusive, and the Company has lost sales to customers that chose to purchase a Gamma Knife unit directly from Elekta. The Company also has several competitors in the financing of proton therapy projects. The Company’s business model differs from its competitors, but there can be no assurances that the Company will not lose placements to its competitors. In addition, the Company may continue to lose future sales to customers purchasing equipment directly from manufacturers. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully compete against others in placing future units and if the Company is not able to compete its business and results of operations could be negatively impacted. There are alternatives to the Gamma Knife and medical centers could choose to use other radiosurgery devices instead of the Gamma Knife. Other radiosurgery devices and conventional neurosurgery compete against the Gamma Knife. Each of the medical centers targeted by the Company could decide to acquire another radiosurgery device instead of a Gamma Knife to perform cranial radiosurgery. In addition, neurosurgeons who are responsible for referring patients for Gamma Knife surgery may not be willing to make such referrals for various reasons, instead opting for invasive surgery. Because of these competing alternatives, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to secure a sufficient number of future sites or Gamma Knife procedures to sustain its profitability and growth and accordingly there may be a material negative impact on the business and results of operations of the Company. International operations make the Company vulnerable to risks associated with doing business in foreign countries that can affect its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The Company installed a Gamma Knife unit in Lima, Peru in 2017 and acquired a Gamma Knife unit operation in Guayaquil, Ecuador in 2020. The Company’s third international site in Puebla, Mexico is expected to begin treating patients in June 2024. International operations can be subject to exchange rate volatility, which could have an adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows. In addition, international operations can be subject to legal and regulatory uncertainty and political and economic instability, which could result in problems asserting property or contractual rights, potential tariffs, increased compliance costs, increased regulatory scrutiny, foreign customers with longer payment cycles than customers in the United States, potential adverse tax consequences, the inability to repatriate funds to the United States, and the Company’s inability to operate in those locations. There can be no assurance that the Company’s pending RI Acquisition will close as anticipated, as the closing of the transactions provided for in the IPA are subject to various judicial, regulatory, and contractual contingencies over which the Company has little to no control The closing of the pending RI Acquisition is contingent upon certain closing conditions, including GenesisCare and the Company entering into a consent agreement with the Rhode Island Department of Health and approval of all equity holders and managers of each RI Target Company. There can be no assurance that the Company and GenesisCare will receive the necessary approvals and consents to effect the RI Acquisition or that such approvals and consents will be delivered. Furthermore, if all of the closing conditions to the RI Acquisition are not met by April 30, 2024, both the Company and GenesisCare have the right to terminate the IPA without completing the RI Acquisition. The Company cannot assure that the pending RI Acquisition will close on our anticipated timeline or at all, or without material adjustment.       14     Table of Contents Flaws in the Company’s ongoing due-diligence assessment in connection with the equity interests and payor contracts to be acquired in the RI Acquisition could have a significant negative effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. The Company conducted due diligence when evaluating the RI Acquisition prior to executing the IPA and continues to complete due diligence during the interim period between signing the IPA and closing the RI Acquisition. The process of completing due diligence is expensive and time consuming due to the operations, accounting, finance, and legal professionals who must be involved in the due-diligence process and the fact that such efforts do not always lead to a consummated transaction. The time and costs of the due-diligence process were amplified with respect to the Company’s evaluation of the potential costs and benefits of the RI Acquisition due to the distressed state and bankruptcy of GenesisCare. Despite the thoroughness of the Company’s review, diligence may not reveal all material issues that could affect the Company’s interests in the RI Target Companies if the RI Acquisition is consummated. In addition, factors outside of the Company’s control could later arise. The Company’s failure to identify material issues specific to the business and operations of the RI Target Companies and the liabilities and obligations the Company is assuming upon the assignment of the payor contracts during the Company’s ongoing due-diligence process could negatively impact the Company’s financial condition and results of operations after the closing of the RI Acquisition. The impact of a pandemic, epidemic, or outbreak of an infection disease, such as COVID-19 and associated economic disruptions, has and may in the future adversely affect the Company’s business operations and financial condition.  The magnitude of the continued impact of COVID-19 on our business and operations are largely dependent on external factors and future developments that are beyond our control, such as the extent and duration of any COVID-19 resurgence, the spread of new variants, the occurrence of other severe health events or similar unprecedented outbreaks, the response to any such resurgence, new variant, or outbreak by government and regulatory agencies, such as the potential reinstatement of “shelter-in-place” lockdown orders, the efficacy and implementation of vaccinations and boosters to counter the virus, the availability of Gamma Knife and PBRT treatments, patients’ assessment of the risks of prioritizing rather than delaying such treatments in the event of any COVID-19 resurgence, new variant, or outbreak, the worsening of current economic conditions, and the severity of ongoing supply-chain disruptions. If there are regressions in our global progress to combat the COVID-19 pandemic or if any similar global public-health events develop, the scope and nature of the impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows would be uncertain and potentially materially adverse. New technology and products could result in making the Company's equipment obsolete which could have a material adverse impact on its business and results of operations.  There is constant change and innovation in the market for highly sophisticated medical equipment. New and improved medical equipment can be introduced that could make the Gamma Knife technology obsolete and that would make it uneconomical to operate. In 2006, Elekta introduced a new model of the Gamma Knife, the Perfexion, which the Company has implemented at all of its domestic sites. The Perfexion can perform procedures faster than previous Gamma Knife models and it involves less health care personnel intervention. In 2015, Elekta introduced the Leksell Gamma Knife Icon ™. The Perfexion is upgradeable to the Icon platforms which has enhanced imaging capabilities allowing for treatment without a head frame and the treatment of larger tumors. In 2022, Elekta introduced an upgrade to the Icon, called the Esprit. Existing model 4(C)s of the Gamma Knife are not upgradeable to the Perfexion model. As of March 1, 2024, two of the Company’s ten Gamma Knife units in the United States are Esprits and eight of the Company’s ten Gamma Knife units are Perfexion models, two of which have the Icon upgrade. The Company’s equipment in Ecuador was upgraded to a Perfexion with Icon in November 2023. The Company’s equipment in Peru is a Model 4(C). The failure to acquire or use new technology and products could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Any failure, interruption, or breach in security of the Company’s information technology (“IT”) infrastructure due to a cyber-attack or other security incident could cause the Company to incur financial penalties and losses, reputational damage, and legal liability, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition, and results of operations. The Company’s ability to carry out its internal and external business operations depends in part on an IT infrastructure that includes computer systems, hardware, software, online sites, servers, networks, and other IT products and services, some of which are owned and managed by third-party service providers and suppliers. Although the Company takes steps to safeguard its IT infrastructure, cybersecurity risks are an evolving and pervasive threat to the Company’s business, operations, and financial performance. Security incidents that the Company must protect against include unauthorized access of the Company’s IT systems, breaches of the Company’s data and confidential information, sophisticated malware, advanced phishing and social-engineering ploys, cyber-attacks, and commercial-software vulnerabilities that are integrated into the Company’s or any of its suppliers’ or service providers’ IT systems. While the Company strives to maintain the integrity and confidentiality of its data, systems, and information and to protect it from internal and external cybersecurity threats by taking the preventative measures and abiding by the security protocols identified in “Item 1C. Cybersecurity” below, there is no guarantee that the IT infrastructure developed by the Company and the cybersecurity measures implemented by the Company will be successful in preventing and defending against the evolving and increasingly sophisticated range of cyber incidents that the Company could be exposed to. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the Company’s cybersecurity risk management strategy and processes will be fully implemented, complied with, or effective in safeguarding the Company’s data, systems, and information. Any actual compromise of or perceived threat to the Company’s IT systems and infrastructure could cause significant legal and financial exposure for the Company, damage the Company’s reputation, and create adverse publicity, which could adversely affect the Company’s business, operations, and financial condition. Any necessary response to a cyber-attack, which could include analyzing a security incident, patching up security vulnerabilities, notifying individuals affected by the incident, determining the materiality of the incident, disclosing the incident in accordance with any applicable legal and regulatory requirements, and responding to any resulting litigation, could also divert the Company’s resources and attention from its growth operations and business objectives, which could further hinder its operational and financial performance. Stock Ownership Risk The trading volume of the Company’s common stock is low Although the Company’s common stock is listed on the NYSE American, the Company’s common stock has historically experienced low trading volume. Reported average daily trading volume in our common stock for the three-month period ended December 31, 2023 was approximately 10,000 shares. There is no reason to think that a further increase in an active trading market in the Company’s common stock will develop in the future. Limited trading volume subjects the Company’s common stock to greater price volatility and may make it difficult for shareholders to sell their shares in a quantity or at a price that is attractive.       15     Table of Contents "
10,AMS,AMERICAN SHARED HSPTL SERV,2023-03-31,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information in this report, the following factors could affect our future business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position, and could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in any of the forward-looking statements contained in this report.        11     Table of Contents Company, Industry and Economic Risk If the Company is not successful at diversifying its business model, its revenues and profitability may decline. The Company has historically relied on Gamma Knife unit placement and a PBRT system to provide its revenues. Currently, there is a limited market for Gamma Knife equipment and PBRT systems. As a result, we plan to adapt our business model to place other types of stereotactic radiosurgery and advanced radiation therapy equipment in addition to Gamma Knife units and PBRT systems. This will constitute an expanded product mix for the Company and there can be no assurance that we can successfully adapt our historical business model to these new product offerings. If we are not successful, our revenues and profitability could decline substantially as existing contracts expire and are not renewed. The Federal reimbursement rate for Gamma Knife treatments may not provide the Company with an adequate return on its investment. Congress enacted legislation in 2013 that significantly reduced the Medicare reimbursement rate for outpatient Gamma Knife treatment by setting it at the same amount paid for linear accelerator-based radiosurgery treatment. Gamma Knife treatment has been relatively stable during the last five years. There can be no assurance that CMS reimbursement levels will be maintained at levels providing the Company an adequate return on its investment. Any future reductions in the reimbursement rate would adversely affect the Company’s revenues and financial results. Introduction of the RO APM reimbursement model could negatively impact the Company's revenue and financial results. On September 18, 2020, CMS issued the final rule that would have implemented a new mandatory payment model for radiation oncology services: the Radiation Oncology Alternative Payment Method (“RO APM”). The RO APM, which was to be in effect for a five year period, has been delayed indefinitely. If the RO APM had not been delayed, it would have significantly altered CMS’ payment methodology from a fee for service paradigm to a set reimbursement by cancer type methodology for radiation services provided within a 90 day episode of care. Under the RO APM, hospital based and free-standing radiation therapy providers would have been required to participate in the model based on whether the radiation therapy provider is located within a randomly selected core-based statistical area. CMS projects that providers treating approximately 30% of radiation oncology patients would have been selected to participate in the RO APM. The remaining providers not included in the RO APM would have continued to receive reimbursement based on a fee-for-service methodology. The RO APM would have included but would not have been limited to PBRT and Gamma Knife services. Three of the Company's Gamma Knife centers were expected to be included in the RO APM. It was not anticipated that inclusion in the RO APM would have a significant impact on the Company's Gamma Knife revenues. The Company's PBRT center was not selected for inclusion in the RO APM. Medicare reimbursement in 2023 for the most commonly used PBRT delivery codes increased by approximately 3.2% and 0.2% and decreased by approximately 3.2% for Gamma Knife. On August 29, 2022, CMS published a final rule that delayed the start date of the RO APM to a date to be determined through future rulemaking and amended the definition of “model performance period” to provide that the start and end dates of the five-year model performance period will be established by CMS through future rulemaking. At this time, it is not clear if the RO APM will be implemented and, if it is implemented, the timing for implementation and in what form it will be implemented.  If a start date for the RO APM is proposed, CMS will provide at least six months’ notice in advance of the proposed start date, and the proposed start date will be subject to public comment. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated economic disruptions may continue to adversely affect the Company’s business operations and financial condition. Our operations and those of our suppliers and customers were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. While the progressive lifting of COVID-related restrictions led to a rebound in procedure volumes for our Gamma Knife business and our PBRT business, the secondary and tertiary effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to present challenges for our business and industry. Such effects may include lingering disruptions in the global supply chain, delays in the manufacturing, delivery, and repair of the equipment we provide, increases in the prices for purchased services and capital acquisition, potential volatility or timing in the demand for Gamma Knife and PBRT treatments, slow recovery in workforce participation, constraints on access to capital, general economic volatility, and pandemic-related inflationary pricing. The magnitude of the continued impact of COVID-19 on our business and operations are largely dependent on external factors and future developments that are beyond our control, such as the extent and duration of any COVID-19 resurgence, the spread of new variants, the occurrence of other severe health events or similar unprecedented outbreaks, the response to any such resurgence, new variant, or outbreak by government and regulatory agencies, such as the potential reinstatement of “shelter-in-place” lockdown orders, the efficacy and implementation of vaccinations and boosters to counter the virus, the availability of Gamma Knife and PBRT treatments, patients’ assessment of the risks of prioritizing rather than delaying such treatments in the event of any COVID-19 resurgence, new variant, or outbreak, the worsening of current economic conditions, and the severity of ongoing supply-chain disruptions. If there are regressions in our global progress to combat the COVID-19 pandemic or if any similar global public-health events develop, the scope and nature of the impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows would be uncertain and potentially materially adverse. We refer you to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Position and Results of Operations” for a more detailed discussions of the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated economic disruptions, and the actual operational and financial impacts that we have experienced to date. The Company's retail revenue is subject to payor mix variability which could negatively impact the Company's revenue and financial results. The Company’s average reimbursement rate for its retail and international customers is dependent on the percentage mix of government associated payors and commercial managed care payors.  Commercial and managed care payors tend to reimburse at a higher level than government payors.  Therefore, a shift in payor mix to a higher level of government payors will reduce the Company’s average reimbursement rate per treatment.         12     Table of Contents The Company’s capital investment at each site is substantial and the Company may not be able to fully recover its costs or capital investment which could have a material negative impact on its revenues and financial results. Each Gamma Knife, PBRT or advanced LINEAR accelerator device requires a substantial capital investment. In some cases, we contribute additional funds for capital costs and/or annual operating and equipment related costs such as marketing, maintenance, insurance and property taxes. Due to the structure of our contracts with medical centers, there can be no assurance that these costs will be fully recovered or that we will earn a satisfactory return on our investment, which could have a material negative impact on our revenues and financial results.  Additionally, the Company is obligated to remove the equipment at the end of the lease term. In the event the customer does not purchase the equipment from the Company or the Company is not able to trade in the equipment, the Company is required to remove the equipment and record an ARO. The market for the Gamma Knife is limited and the Company may not be able to place additional Gamma Knife units which could negatively impact the Company's revenue and financial results. There is a limited market for the Gamma Knife, and the market in the United States may be mature. The Company has begun and continued operation at only seven new Gamma Knife sites in the United States since 2011. Due to the substantial costs of acquiring a Gamma Knife unit, we must identify medical centers that possess neurosurgery and radiation oncology departments capable of performing a large number of Gamma Knife procedures. As of December 31, 2022, there were 118 operating Gamma Knife units in the United States, of which twelve units were owned by the Company. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in placing additional units at any sites in the future. In recognition of the Gamma Knife's limited growth opportunity, the Company has expanded its product mix to include LINACs, MRI LINACs, PET LINACs and is continuing to market PBRT units, but there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in placing these products with customers. The Company’s existing contracts with its customers are fixed in length and there can be no assurance that the customers will wish to extend the contract beyond the end of the term. The Company has a high level of debt and may incur additional debt to finance its operations and if the Company is unable to secure additional credit in the future its operations and profits will be negatively impacted. The Company’s business is capital intensive. On April 9, 2021, the Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries entered into a five year $22,000,000 credit agreement with Fifth Third Bank, N.A., which refinanced its existing domestic Gamma Knife portfolio.  The lease financing previously obtained by Orlando was also refinanced as long-term debt by the Credit Agreement. In June 2020, the Company entered into the DFC Loan in connection with the acquisition of GKCE. The Company’s combined long-term debt, net, totaled $13,467,000 as of December 31, 2022. The Credit Agreement is secured by a lien on substantially all of the assets of the Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries and the DFC Loan is secured by a lien on GKCE’s assets. The Credit Agreement includes a line of credit of $7,000,000 that it has not drawn on as of December 31, 2022. Depending on the Company’s financing requirements and market conditions, the Company may seek to finance its operations by incurring additional long-term debt in the future. The Company’s current level of debt may adversely affect the Company’s ability to secure additional credit in the future, and as a result may affect operations and profitability. If a default on debt occurs in the future, the Company’s creditors would have the ability to accelerate the defaulted loan, to seize the Company’s assets with respect to which default has occurred, and to apply any collateral they may have at the time to cure the default. A small number of customers account for a major portion of our revenues and the loss of any one of these significant customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and results of operations. A limited number of customers have historically accounted for a substantial portion of the Company’s total revenue, and the Company expects such customer concentration to continue for the foreseeable future. For example, in 2022, one customer in total accounted for approximately 45% of the Company’s revenue. The loss of a significant customer or a significant decline in the business from the Company’s largest customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations. The market for the Company’s services is competitive and if the Company is not able to compete its business and results of operations could be negatively impacted. The Company estimates that there are two other companies that actively provide alternative, non-conventional Gamma Knife financing to potential customers. The Company’s relationship with Elekta, the manufacturer of the Leksell Gamma Knife unit, is non-exclusive, and in the past the Company has lost sales to customers that chose to purchase a Gamma Knife unit directly from Elekta. The Company also has several competitors in the financing of proton therapy projects. The Company’s business model differs from its competitors, but there can be no assurances that the Company will not lose placements to its competitors. In addition, the Company may continue to lose future sales to customers purchasing equipment directly from manufacturers. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully compete against others in placing future units and if the Company is not able to compete its business and results of operations could be negatively impacted. There are alternatives to the Gamma Knife and medical centers could choose to use other radiosurgery devices instead of the Gamma Knife. Other radiosurgery devices and conventional neurosurgery compete against the Gamma Knife. Each of the medical centers targeted by the Company could decide to acquire another radiosurgery device instead of a Gamma Knife to perform cranial radiosurgery. In addition, neurosurgeons who are responsible for referring patients for Gamma Knife surgery may not be willing to make such referrals for various reasons, instead opting for invasive surgery. Because of these competing alternatives, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to secure a sufficient number of future sites or Gamma Knife procedures to sustain its profitability and growth and accordingly there may be a material negative impact on the business and results of operations of the Company. International operations make the Company vulnerable to risks associated with doing business in foreign countries that can affect its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The Company installed a Gamma Knife unit in Lima, Peru in 2017 and acquired a Gamma Knife unit operation in Guayaquil, Ecuador in 2020. International operations can be subject to exchange rate volatility, which could have an adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows. In addition, international operations can be subject to legal and regulatory uncertainty and political and economic instability, which could result in problems asserting property or contractual rights, potential tariffs, increased compliance costs, increased regulatory scrutiny, potential adverse tax consequences, the inability to repatriate funds to the United States, and the Company’s inability to operate in those locations.        13     Table of Contents New technology and products could result in making the Company's equipment obsolete which could have a material adverse impact on its business and results of operations.  There is constant change and innovation in the market for highly sophisticated medical equipment. New and improved medical equipment can be introduced that could make the Gamma Knife technology obsolete and that would make it uneconomical to operate. In 2006, Elekta introduced a new model of the Gamma Knife, the Perfexion, which the Company has implemented at all of its domestic sites. The Perfexion can perform procedures faster than previous Gamma Knife models and it involves less health care personnel intervention. In 2015, Elekta introduced the Leksell Gamma Knife Icon ™. The Perfexion is upgradeable to the Icon platforms which has enhanced imaging capabilities allowing for treatment without a head frame and the treatment of larger tumors. In 2022, Elekta introduced an upgrade to the Icon, called the Esprit. Existing model 4(C)s of the Gamma Knife are not upgradeable to the Perfexion model. As of March 1, 2023, all the Company’s Gamma Knife units in the United States are Perfexion models and two of these Perfexion units have the Icon upgrade. The Company's two South American sites utilize the Model 4(C). The failure to acquire or use new technology and products could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The Company has invested in a Proton Beam business and is obligated to fund two additional proton beams systems; there is no assurance that the Company will be able to fund these additional proton systems and if the Company is unable to do so the may be a negative impact on the Company’s business and results of operations. We have committed a substantial amount of our financial resources to next-generation proton beam technology. The first MEVION S250 system began treating patients in December 2013. The Company’s first MEVION S250 system began treating patients in April 2016. The Company has committed to purchase two additional MEVION S250i systems and has already made deposits of $2,250,000 towards this commitment. As of December 31, 2020, the Company determined these deposits were impaired and wrote their value down to $0. See Note 3 - Property and Equipment to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional customers or be able to finance the two additional systems. If we are unable to obtain additional customers or are unable to finance the two additional systems, the Company will lose its deposits. Stock Ownership Risk The Trading Volume of Our Common Stock is Low Although our common stock is listed on the NYSE American, our common stock has historically experienced low trading volume. Reported average daily trading volume in our common stock for the three-month period ended December 31, 2022 was approximately 12,000 shares. There is no reason to think that a further increase in an active trading market in our common stock will develop in the future. Limited trading volume subjects our common stock to greater price volatility and may make it difficult for you to sell your shares in a quantity or at a price that is attractive to you. "
1,AMS,AMERICAN SHARED HSPTL SERV,2022-03-30,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information in this report, the following factors could affect our future business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position, and could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in any of the forward-looking statements contained in this report.        12     Table of Contents Company, Industry and Economic Risk The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated economic disruptions may continue to adversely affect the company’s business operations and financial condition. The ongoing novel coronavirus COVID-19 has spread across the globe, has been declared a national emergency in the United States, Peru and Ecuador, and, during 2020, shut down many business operations around the globe. Many states and municipalities in the United States, Peru and Ecuador, have recommended or mandated aggressive and unprecedented actions to reduce the spread of the disease, including limiting non-essential gatherings of people, ceasing all non-essential travel, ordering certain businesses and government agencies to cease non-essential operations at physical locations and issuing shelter-in-place” orders, which direct individuals to shelter at their places of residence (subject to limited exceptions). Across our operations, although most governmental restrictions on certain medical procedures have been lifted, the pandemic adversely impacted our business, as healthcare resources were being prioritized for the treatment and management of the outbreak in some cases. Consequently, there may continue to be delays in delivering certain Gamma Knife and PBRT treatments and significant volatility or reductions in demand for such treatments may continue. The COVID-19 pandemic poses the risk that the Company or its employees, contractors, customers, government and third party payors and others may be prevented from conducting business activities at full capacity for an indefinite period of time, including due to spread of the disease within these groups or due to shutdowns that have been and may continue to be recommended or mandated by governmental authorities. A broad, sustained continuation of the COVID-19 pandemic could continue to negatively impact the Company for the following reasons:   •  operations at certain medical facilities, including medical professionals and other medical facility employees, may be subject to prolonged closure or shut down and may impact our ability to market and deliver Gamma Knife and PBRT treatments;   •  medical facilities may defer certain Gamma Knife and PBRT treatments for non-urgent patient cases in order to allocate resources to the care of patients with COVID-19;   •  patients may continue to defer certain Gamma Knife and PBRT treatments due to real or perceived concerns about the potential spread of COVID-19 in a medical facility setting;   •  certain deferred Gamma Knife and PBRT treatments may not be rescheduled for a later date;   •  there may be significant volatility or continued reductions in demand for Gamma Knife and PBRT treatments due to limitations on operations at medical facilities, including in geographies that continue to experience severe impacts of the pandemic;  •there may be continued disruptions to the supply chain of the Company’s suppliers, resulting in price increases for purchased services and capital acquisitions by the Company;   •  the pandemic may materially impact the Company’s operations for a sustained period of time due to the current travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and shutdowns;   •  and/or members of the board, management or employee team, some of whom are particularly at risk for the severe symptoms of COVID-19, or of our small number of other employees, may become ill or have family members who are ill and are absent as a result, or they may elect not to come to work due to the illness affecting others in our office or facilities.  The occurrence of any of the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows. The COVID-19 pandemic and mitigation measures have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on global economic conditions and healthcare activity, which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s business and financial condition. The full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic remains unknown, including the impact on the global economy and the healthcare industry. The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak impacts the Company’s results will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the virus and its variants, the effectiveness and implementation of vaccinations to counter the virus, actions to contain its impact, the efficacy of the current governmental orders in slowing down the pandemic, the governments’ changing calculations on the economic impact and the health implications of maintaining these orders, the progress in the healthcare industry’s ability to effectively combat the virus, and potential increase or decrease in healthcare demand, volatility and uncertainty resulting from COVID-19 responses, all of which are highly unpredictable. Likewise, the financial market as a whole has experienced extreme volatility as a result of the global economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has impacted, and may continue to impact, the Company’s stock price. We refer you to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Position and Results of Operations” for a more detailed discussions of the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated economic disruptions, and the actual operational and financial impacts that we have experienced to date.        13     Table of Contents If the Company is not successful at diversifying its business model, its revenues and profitability may decline. The Company has historically relied on Gamma Knife unit placement and a PBRT system to provide its revenues. Currently, there is a limited market for Gamma Knife equipment and there are few prospects for PBRT systems. As a result, we plan to adapt our business model to place other types of stereotactic radiosurgery and advanced radiation therapy equipment in addition to Gamma Knife units and PBRT systems. This will constitute an expanded product mix for the Company and there can be no assurance that we can successfully adapt our historical business model to these new product offerings. If we are not successful, our revenues and profitability could decline substantially as existing contracts expire and are not renewed. The Federal reimbursement rate for Gamma Knife treatments may not provide the Company with an adequate return on its investment. Congress enacted legislation in 2013 that significantly reduced the Medicare reimbursement rate for outpatient Gamma Knife treatment by setting it at the same amount paid for linear accelerator-based radiosurgery treatment. Gamma Knife treatment has been relatively stable during the last five years. There can be no assurance that CMS reimbursement levels will be maintained at levels providing the Company an adequate return on its investment. Any future reductions in the reimbursement rate would adversely affect the Company’s revenues and financial results. Introduction of the RO APM reimbursement model could negatively impact the Company's revenue and financial results. On September 18, 2020, CMS issued the final rule that would implement a new mandatory payment model for radiation oncology services: the RO APM. The RO APM is scheduled to commence January 1, 2023 and will be in effect for a five year period. The RO APM significantly alters CMS' payment methodology from a fee for service paradigm to a set reimbursement by cancer type methodology for radiation services provided within a 90 day episode of care. Under the RO APM, hospital based and free-standing radiation therapy providers are mandatorily required to participate in the model based on whether the radiation therapy provider is located within a randomly selected CBSA. CMS projects that providers treating approximately 30% of radiation oncology patients have been selected to participate in the RO APM. The remaining providers not included in the RO APM will continue to receive reimbursement based on a fee-for-service methodology. The RO APM includes but is not limited to PBRT and Gamma Knife services. Three of the Company’s Gamma Knife centers are included in the RO APM. It is not anticipated that inclusion in the RO APM will have a significant impact on the Company’s Gamma Knife domestic revenues. The Company’s PBRT center was not initially selected for inclusion in the RO APM, but it could be included at a later date. If the Company’s PBRT center is included at a later date, the episodic payment methodology is estimated to result in lower reimbursement than the current fee-per-service reimbursement.  The Company's retail revenue is subject to payor mix variability which could negatively impact the Company's revenue and financial results. The Company’s average reimbursement rate for its retail and international customers is dependent on the percentage mix of government associated payors and commercial managed care payors.  Commercial and managed care payors tend to reimburse at a higher level than government payors.  Therefore, a shift in payor mix to a higher level of government payors will reduce the Company’s average reimbursement rate per treatment.  The Company’s capital investment at each site is substantial and the Company may not be able to fully recover its costs or capital investment which could have a material negative impact on its revenues and financial results. Each Gamma Knife, PBRT or advanced LINEAR accelerator device requires a substantial capital investment. In some cases, we contribute additional funds for capital costs and/or annual operating and equipment related costs such as marketing, maintenance, insurance and property taxes. Due to the structure of our contracts with medical centers, there can be no assurance that these costs will be fully recovered or that we will earn a satisfactory return on our investment, which could have a material negative impact on our revenues and financial results.  Additionally, the Company is obligated to remove the equipment at the end of the lease term. In the event the customer does not purchase the equipment from the Company or the Company is not able to trade in the equipment, the Company is required to remove the equipment and record an ARO. The market for the Gamma Knife is limited and the Company may not be able to place additional Gamma Knife units which could negatively impact the Company's revenue and financial results. There is a limited market for the Gamma Knife, and the market in the United States may be mature. The Company has begun and continued operation at only seven new Gamma Knife sites in the United States since 2011. Due to the substantial costs of acquiring a Gamma Knife unit, we must identify medical centers that possess neurosurgery and radiation oncology departments capable of performing a large number of Gamma Knife procedures. As of December 31, 2021, there were approximately 115 operating Gamma Knife units in the United States, of which thirteen units were owned by the Company. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in placing additional units at any sites in the future. In recognition of the Gamma Knife's limited growth opportunity, the Company has expanded its product mix to include LINACs, MRI LINACs, PET LINACs and is continuing to market PBRT units, but there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in placing these products with customers. The Company’s existing contracts with its customers are fixed in length and there can be no assurance that the customers will wish to extend the contract beyond the end of the term.        14     Table of Contents The Company has a high level of debt and may incur additional debt to finance its operations and if the Company is unable to secure additional credit in the future its operations and profits will be negatively impacted. The Company’s business is capital intensive. On April 9, 2021, the Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries entered into a five year $22,000,000 credit agreement with Fifth Third Bank, N.A., which refinanced its existing domestic Gamma Knife portfolio.  The lease financing previously obtained by Orlando was also refinanced as long-term debt by the Credit Agreement. In June 2020, the Company entered into the DFC Loan in connection with the acquisition of GKCE. The Company’s combined long-term debt, net, totaled $15,404,000 as of December 31, 2021. The Credit Agreement is secured by a lien on substantially all of the assets of the Company and certain of its domestic subsidiaries and the DFC Loan is secured by a lien on GKCE’s assets. The Credit Agreement includes a line of credit of $7,000,000 that it has not drawn on as of December 31, 2021. Depending on the Company’s financing requirements and market conditions, the Company may seek to finance its operations by incurring additional long-term debt in the future. The Company’s current level of debt may adversely affect the Company’s ability to secure additional credit in the future, and as a result may affect operations and profitability. If a default on debt occurs in the future, the Company’s creditors would have the ability to accelerate the defaulted loan, to seize the Company’s assets with respect to which default has occurred, and to apply any collateral they may have at the time to cure the default. A small number of customers account for a major portion of our revenues and the loss of any one of these significant customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and results of operations. A limited number of customers have historically accounted for a substantial portion of the Company’s total revenue, and the Company expects such customer concentration to continue for the foreseeable future. For example, in 2021, three customers in total accounted for approximately 50% of the Company’s revenue. The loss of a significant customer or a significant decline in the business from the Company’s largest customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations. The market for the company’s services is competitive and if the Company is not able to compete its business and results of operations could be negatively impacted. The Company estimates that there are two other companies that actively provide alternative, non-conventional Gamma Knife financing to potential customers.

The RO APM is scheduled to commence January 1, 2022 and will be in effect for a five (5) year period.  The RO APM significantly alters CMS' payment methodology from a fee for service paradigm to a set reimbursement by cancer type methodology for radiation services provided within a 90 day episode of care.

The remaining providers not included in the RO APM will continue to receive reimbursement based on a fee-for-service methodology.  The RO APM includes but is not limited to PBRT and Gamma Knife services. Four (4) of the Company's Gamma Knife centers are scheduled to be included in the RO APM.  It is not anticipated that inclusion in the RO APM will have a significant impact on the Company's Gamma Knife revenues. The Company's PBRT center was not selected for inclusion in the RO APM. For centers not included in the RO APM proposed model, Medicare reimbursement in 2021 for the most commonly used PBRT delivery codes will increase by approximately 4.1% and decrease by approximately 1.7% for Gamma Knife.The Company’s capital investment at each site is substantial and the Company may not be able to fully recover its costs or capital investment which could have a material negative impact on its revenues and financial results.Each Gamma Knife, PBRT or advanced LINEAR accelerator device requires a substantial capital investment.

As of December 31, 2020, there were approximately 116 operating Gamma Knife units in the United States, of which fourteen (14) units were owned by the Company. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in placing additional units at any sites in the future. The Company’s existing contracts with its customers are fixed in length and there can be no assurance that the customers will wish to extend the contract beyond the end of the term.14Table of ContentsThe Company has a high level of debt and may incur additional debt to finance its operations and if the Company is unable to secure additional credit in the future its operations and profits will be negatively impacted.The Company’s business is capital intensive. The Company finances its Gamma Knife units through its GKF subsidiary. The amounts financed through GKF have been generally non-recourse to ASHS. The Company financed its first proton therapy unit through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Orlando, and guaranteed the lease financing. The Company’s combined long-term debt and finance leases totaled $13,516,000 as of December 31, 2020 and is collateralized by its Gamma Knife, MEVION S250 and other assets, including accounts receivable and future proceeds from any contract between the Company and any end user of the financed equipment. Depending on the Company’s financing requirements and market conditions, the Company may seek to finance its operations by incurring additional long-term debt in the future. The Company’s current level of debt may adversely affect the Company’s ability to secure additional credit in the future, and as a result may affect operations and profitability. If a default on debt occurs in the future, the Company’s creditors would have the ability to accelerate the defaulted loan, to seize the Gamma Knife or MEVION S250 units or other equipment with respect to which default has occurred, and to apply any collateral they may have at the time to cure the default.A small number of customers account for a major portion of our revenues and the loss of any one of theses significant customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and results of operations.A limited number of customers have historically accounted for a substantial portion of the Company’s total revenue, and the Company expects such customer concentration to continue for the foreseeable future. For example, in 2020, four (4) customers in total accounted for approximately 50% of the Company’s revenue. The loss of a significant customer or a significant decline in the business from the Company’s largest customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations.The market for the company’s services is competitive and if the Company is not able to compete its business and results of operations could be negatively impacted.The Company estimates that there are two other companies that actively provide alternative, non-conventional Gamma Knife financing to potential customers. The Company’s relationship with Elekta, the manufacturer of the Leksell Gamma Knife unit, is non-exclusive, and in the past the Company has lost sales to customers that chose to purchase a Gamma Knife unit directly from Elekta. The Company also has several competitors in the financing of proton therapy projects. The Company’s business model differs from its competitors, but there can be no assurances that the Company will not lose placements to its competitors. In addition, the Company may continue to lose future sales to customers purchasing equipment directly from manufacturers. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully compete against others in placing future units and if the Company is not able to compete its business and results of operations could be negatively impacted.There are alternatives to the Gamma Knife and medical centers could choose to use other radiosurgery devices instead of the Gamma Knife.Other radiosurgery devices and conventional neurosurgery compete against the Gamma Knife. Each of the medical centers targeted by the Company could decide to acquire another radiosurgery device instead of a Gamma Knife to perform cranial radiosurgery. In addition, neurosurgeons who are responsible for referring patients for Gamma Knife surgery may not be willing to make such referrals for various reasons, instead opting for invasive surgery. Because of these competing technologies, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to secure a sufficient number of future sites or Gamma Knife procedures to sustain its profitability and growth and accordingly there may be a material negative impact on the business and results of operations of the Company.International Operations make the Company vulnerable to risks associated with doing business in foreign countries that can affect its business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.The Company installed a Gamma Knife unit in Lima, Peru in 2017 and acquired a Gamma Knife unit operation in Guayaquil, Ecuador in 2020. International operations can be subject to exchange rate volatility, which could have an adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows. In addition, international operations can be subject to legal and regulatory uncertainty and political and economic instability, which could result in problems asserting property or contractual rights, potential tariffs, increased compliance costs, increased regulatory scrutiny, potential adverse tax consequences, the inability to repatriate funds to the United States, and the Company’s inability to operate in those locations.15Table of ContentsNew technology and products could result in making the Company's equipment obsolete which could have a material adverse impact on its business and results of operations. There is constant change and innovation in the market for highly sophisticated medical equipment. New and improved medical equipment can be introduced that could make the Gamma Knife technology obsolete and that would make it uneconomical to operate. In 2006 Elekta introduced a new model of the Gamma Knife, the Perfexion, which the Company has implemented at all of its domestic sites. The Perfexion can perform procedures faster than previous Gamma Knife models and it involves less health care personnel intervention. In 2015, Elekta introduced the Leksell Gamma Knife Icon ™. The Perfexion is upgradeable to the Icon platforms which has enhanced imaging capabilities allowing for treatment without a head frame and the treatment of larger tumors. Existing model 4Cs of the Gamma Knife are not upgradeable to the Perfexion model. As of March 1, 2021, all the Company’s Gamma Knife units in the United States are Perfexion models and two (2) of these Perfexion units have the Icon upgrade. The Company's two (2) South American sites utilize the Model 4(C). The failure to acquire or use new technology and products could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.The Company has invested in a Proton Beam business and is obligated to fund two additional proton beams systems; there is no assurance that the Company will be able to fund these additional proton systems and if the Company is unable to do so the may be a negative impact on the Company’s business and results of operations.We have committed a substantial amount of our financial resources to next-generation proton beam technology. The first MEVION S250 system began treating patients in December 2013. The Company’s first MEVION S250 system began treating patients in April 2016. The Company has committed to purchase two (2) additional MEVION S250i systems and has already made deposits of $2,250,000 towards this commitment. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional customers or be able to finance the two additional systems. If we are unable to obtain additional customers or are unable to finance the two additional systems, the Company will lose its deposits and there may be a negative impact on the Company’s business and results of operations.Stock Ownership RiskThe Trading Volume of Our Common Stock is LowAlthough our common stock is listed on the NYSE American, our common stock has historically experienced low trading volume. Reported average daily trading volume in our common stock for the three-month period ended December 31, 2020 was approximately 105,000 shares. There is no reason to think that a further increase in an active trading market in our common stock will develop in the future. Limited trading volume subjects our common stock to greater price volatility and may make it difficult for you to sell your shares in a quantity or at a price that is attractive to you"

RISK FACTORSIn addition to the other information in this report, the following factors could affect our future business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position, and could cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in any of the forward-looking statements contained in this report.The COVID-19 Outbreak May Adversely Affect Our Business Operations and Financial ConditionThe recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic has spread across the globe and has been declared a national emergency. Many states and municipalities in the United States, including California, have announced aggressive actions to reduce the spread of the disease, including limiting non-essential gatherings of people, ceasing all non-essential travel, ordering certain businesses and government agencies to cease non-essential operations at physical locations and issuing “shelter-in-place” orders, which direct individuals to shelter at their places of residence (subject to limited exceptions). Across our business, healthcare resources are being prioritized for the treatment and management of the outbreak. Consequently, there are delays in delivering Gamma Knife, image guided radiation and proton therapy treatments. The COVID-19 pandemic poses the risk that we or our employees, contractors, customers, government and third party payors and others may be prevented from conducting business activities for an indefinite period of time, including due to spread of the disease within these groups or due to shutdowns that have been and may continue to be requested or mandated by governmental authorities. 13Table of ContentsA broad, sustained outbreak of COVID-19 will negatively impact our results for the following reasons: (i) operations at medical facilities, including medical professionals and other medical facility employees, may continue to be subject to prolonged closure or shut down; (ii) medical facilities may continue to defer Gamma Knife, proton and image guided radiation therapy treatments for non-urgent patient cases in order to allocate resources to the care of patients with COVID-19; (iii) patients may continue to defer Gamma Knife, proton and image guided radiation therapy treatments due to real or perceived concerns about the potential spread of COVID-19 in a medical facility setting; (iv) deferred Gamma Knife, proton and image guided radiation therapy treatments may not be rescheduled for a later date; (v) the outbreak materially impacts our operations for a sustained period of time due to the current travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and shutdowns, including at our corporate headquarters in San Francisco, California, which is currently subject to a shelter-in-place order that remains in force until April 7, 2020 and may be extended; and/or (vi) members of the board, management or employee team, some of whom are particularly at-risk for the severe symptoms of COVID-19, or of our small number of other employees, may become ill or have family members who are ill and are absent as a result, or they may elect not to come to work due to the illness affecting others in our office or facilities.The occurrence of any of the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The COVID-19 outbreak and mitigation measures have had and may continue to have an adverse impact on global economic conditions which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial condition. The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak impacts our results will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity of the virus and the actions to contain its impact.The Federal Reimbursement Rate for Gamma Knife Treatments Has FluctuatedCongress enacted legislation in 2013 that significantly reduced the Medicare reimbursement rate for outpatient Gamma Knife treatment by setting it at the same amount paid for linear accelerator-based radiosurgery treatment. Prior to April 1, 2013, Medicare’s reimbursement rate for Gamma Knife treatment had been relatively stable. There can be no assurance that CMS reimbursement levels will be maintained at levels providing the Company an adequate return on its investment. Any future reductions in the reimbursement rate would adversely affect the Company’s revenues and financial results.The average Medicare reimbursement rate trends from 2016 to 2020 are outlined below:Average Medicare Reimbursement Rate Trends20162017201820192020$8,800  $9,000  $9,100  $9,300  $9,600  The Federal Reimbursement Rate for Proton Therapy May FluctuateIn July 2019, CMS issued a proposed rule that would implement a new mandatory payment model for radiation oncology services. The proposed rule implementing the payment model has not been finalized and consequently the timing and details of the payment model are uncertain. Any reductions in the reimbursement rates or changes in reimbursement methodology or administration for radiosurgery and radiation therapy could adversely affect the Company’s revenues and financial results.The Company’s Capital Investment at Each Site is SubstantialEach Gamma Knife, PBRT or IGRT device requires a substantial capital investment. In some cases, we contribute additional funds for capital costs and/or annual operating and equipment related costs such as marketing, maintenance, insurance and property taxes. Due to the structure of our contracts with medical centers, there can be no assurance that these costs will be fully recovered or that we will earn a satisfactory return on our investment.The Market for the Gamma Knife is LimitedThere is a limited market for the Gamma Knife, and the market in the United States may be mature. The Company has begun and continued operation at only seven (7) new Gamma Knife sites in the United States since 2011. Due to the substantial costs of acquiring a Gamma Knife unit, we must identify medical centers that possess neurosurgery and radiation oncology departments capable of performing a large number of Gamma Knife procedures. As of December 31, 2019, there were approximately 120 operating Gamma Knife units in the United States, of which fifteen (15) units were owned by the Company. As of December 31, 2019, the Company has two idle Gamma Knife units with a cumulative net book value of $943,000. There are currently no commitments to place into service or trade these units in during 2020. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in placing these idle units or additional units at any sites in the future. The Company’s existing contracts with its customers are fixed in length and there can be no assurance that the customers will wish to extend the contract beyond the end of the term.14Table of ContentsThe Company Has a High Level of Debt and May Incur Additional Debt to Finance its OperationsThe Company’s business is capital intensive. The Company finances its Gamma Knife units through its GKF subsidiary. The amounts financed through GKF have been generally non-recourse to ASHS. The Company financed its first proton therapy unit through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Orlando, and guaranteed the lease financing. The Company’s combined long-term debt and finance leases totaled $15,366,000 as of December 31, 2019 and is collateralized by its Gamma Knife, MEVION S250 and other assets, including accounts receivable and future proceeds from any contract between the Company and any end user of the financed equipment. Depending on the Company’s financing requirements and market conditions, the Company may seek to finance its operations by incurring additional long-term debt in the future. The Company’s current level of debt may adversely affect the Company’s ability to secure additional credit in the future, and as a result may affect operations and profitability. If a default on debt occurs in the future, the Company’s creditors would have the ability to accelerate the defaulted loan, to seize the Gamma Knife or MEVION S250 units or other equipment with respect to which default has occurred, and to apply any collateral they may have at the time to cure the default.A Small Number of Customers Account for a Major Portion of our RevenuesA limited number of customers have historically accounted for a substantial portion of the Company’s total revenue, and the Company expects such customer concentration to continue for the foreseeable future. For example, in 2019, three (3) customers in total accounted for approximately 50% of the Company’s revenue. The loss of a significant customer or a significant decline in the business from the Company’s largest customers could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations.The Market for the Company’s Services is CompetitiveThe Company estimates that there are two other companies that actively provide alternative, non-conventional Gamma Knife financing to potential customers. We believe there are no competitor companies that currently have more than three (3) Gamma Knife units in operation.

New and improved medical equipment can be introduced that could make the Gamma Knife technology obsolete and that would make it uneconomical to operate. During 2000, Elekta introduced an upgraded Gamma Knife which cost approximately $3.6 million plus applicable tax and duties. This upgrade includes an Automatic Positioning System™ (“APS”), and therefore involved less health care provider intervention. In early 2005, Elekta introduced a new upgrade, the Gamma Knife Model 4C (“Model 4C”). The cost to upgrade existing units to the Model 4C with APS was approximately $200,000 to $1,000,000, depending on the current Gamma Knife configuration. In 2006 Elekta introduced a new model of the Gamma Knife, the Perfexion, which costs approximately $4.5 million plus applicable taxes and duties. The Perfexion can perform procedures faster than previous Gamma Knife models and it involves less health care personnel intervention. In 2015, Elekta introduced the Leksell Gamma Knife Icon ™.

In April 2013, the Medicare reimbursement rate for Gamma Knife treatment was lowered fromapproximately $9,900 to $5,300 per treatment session. This sudden reduction in a rate that had historically been stable resultedin a significant decrease in the Company’s revenues from all of our revenue sharing and some of our fixed fee medical centers.The reimbursement rate was subsequently increased to approximately $5,600 in 2014. Effective January 1, 2015, CMS established acomprehensive Ambulatory Payment Classification (APC) for both Gamma Knife and LINAC one session cranial radiosurgery at a reimbursementrate of approximately $9,700. This represents an estimated increase of $4,100 per Medicare Gamma Knife treatment (exclusive ofco-insurance and other adjustments) effective January 1, 2015 compared to the 2014 Medicare reimbursement rate. The 2016 reimbursementlevel was reduced by CMS to approximately $8,800 but increased to approximately $9,000 in 2017 and increased again to $9,100 in2018. There can be no assurance that CMS reimbursement levels will be maintained at levels providing the Company an adequate returnon its investment.

The Company’s business model differs from its competitors, but there can be no assurances thatthe Company will not lose placements to its competitors. In addition, the Company may continue to lose future sales to customerspurchasing equipment directly from manufacturers. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to successfully competeagainst others in placing future units. There are Alternatives to the GammaKnife Other radiosurgery devices and conventionalneurosurgery compete against the Gamma Knife. Each of the medical centers targeted by the Company could decide to acquire anotherradiosurgery device instead of a Gamma Knife. In addition, neurosurgeons who are responsible for referring patients for Gamma Knifesurgery may not be willing to make such referrals for various reasons, instead opting for invasive surgery. There can be no assurancethat the Company will be able to secure a sufficient number of future sites or Gamma Knife procedures to sustain its profitabilityand growth. International Operations The Company installed a Gamma Knife inLima, Peru in 2017. International operations can be subject to exchange rate volatility which could have an adverse effect on ourfinancial results and cash flows. In addition, international operations can be subject to legal and regulatory uncertainty andpolitical and economic instability, which could result in problems asserting property or contractual rights, potential tariffs,increased compliance costs, increased regulatory scrutiny, potential adverse tax consequences, the inability to repatriate fundsto the United States, and the Company’s inability to operate in those locations.  14   New Technology and Products Could Resultin Equipment Obsolescence There is constant change and innovationin the market for highly sophisticated medical equipment. New and improved medical equipment can be introduced that could makethe Gamma Knife technology obsolete and that would make it uneconomical to operate. During 2000, Elekta introduced an upgradedGamma Knife which cost approximately $3.6 million plus applicable tax and duties. This upgrade includes an Automatic PositioningSystem™ (“APS”), and therefore involved less health care provider intervention. In early 2005, Elekta introduceda new upgrade, the Gamma Knife Model 4C (“Model 4C”). The cost to upgrade existing units to the Model 4C with APS wasapproximately $200,000 to $1,000,000, depending on the current Gamma Knife configuration. In 2006 Elekta introduced a new modelof the Gamma Knife, the Perfexion, which costs approximately $4.5 million plus applicable taxes and duties. The Perfexion can performprocedures faster than previous Gamma Knife models and it involves less health care personnel intervention. In 2015, Elekta introducedthe Leksell Gamma Knife Icon TM. The Perfexion is upgradeable to the Icon platforms which has enhanced imaging capabilitiesallowing for treatment without a head frame and the treatment of larger tumors. Existing model 4Cs of the Gamma Knife are not upgradeableto the Perfexion model. As of March 1, 2018, 14 of the Company’s Gamma Knife units are Perfexion models; of the Company’sremaining Gamma Knife units, two (2) are Model 4Cs with APS and one is upgradeable to a more advanced Model 4C unit. The failureto acquire or use new technology and products could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, there are constant advancesmade in radiation therapy equipment. The Company purchased IGRT and CT Simulator systems in 2006 with a list price of approximately$8,300,000. As in the Gamma Knife business, new and improved IGRT equipment can be introduced that could make the existing technologyobsolete and that would make it uneconomical to operate. The Company Has Invested in a ProtonBeam Business We have committed a substantial amountof our financial resources to next-generation proton beam technology. The first MEVION S250 system began treating patients in December2013. The Company’s first MEVION S250 system began treating patients in April 2016. The Company has committed to purchasetwo (2) additional MEVION S250 systems and has already made deposits of $2,000,000 towards this commitment. There can be no assurancethat we will be able to finance the two additional systems. The Trading Volume of Our Common Stockis Low Although our common stock is listed onthe NYSE MKT, our common stock has historically experienced low trading volume. Reported average daily trading volume in our commonstock for the three-month period ended December 31, 2017 was approximately 16,000 shares. There is no reason to think that a moresignificant active trading market in our common stock will develop in the future. Limited trading volume subjects our common stockto greater price volatility and may make it difficult for you to sell your shares in a quantity or at a price that is attractiveto you. "

RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information in thisreport, the following factors could affect our future business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position, and couldcause future results to differ materially from those expressed in any of the forward-looking statements contained in this report. The Federal Reimbursement Rate for GammaKnife Treatments Has FluctuatedCongress enacted legislation in 2013 that significantlyreduced the Medicare reimbursement rate for outpatient Gamma Knife treatment by setting it at the same amount paid for linear accelerator-basedradiosurgery treatment. Prior to April 1, 2013, Medicare’s reimbursement rate for Gamma Knife treatment had been relativelystable. In April 2013, the Medicare reimbursement rate for Gamma Knife treatment was lowered from approximately $9,900 to $5,300per treatment session. This sudden reduction in a rate that had historically been stable resulted in a significant decrease inthe Company’s revenues from all of our revenue sharing and some of our fixed fee medical centers. The reimbursement ratewas subsequently increased to approximately $5,600 in 2014. Effective January 1, 2015, CMS established a comprehensive AmbulatoryPayment Classification (APC) for both Gamma Knife and LINAC one session cranial radiosurgery at a reimbursement rate of approximately$9,700. This represents an estimated increase of $4,100 per Medicare Gamma Knife treatment (exclusive of co-insurance and otheradjustments) effective January 1, 2015 compared to the 2014 Medicare reimbursement rate. The 2016 reimbursement level was reducedby CMS to approximately $8,800, but is scheduled to increase to approximately $9,000 in 2017. There can be no assurance that CMSreimbursement levels will be maintained at levels providing the Company an adequate return on its investment. Any future reductionsin the reimbursement rate would adversely affect the Company’s revenues and financial results. The average Medicare reimbursement rate trendsfrom 2013 to 2017 are outlined below: Average Medicare Reimbursement Rate Trends                2013   2014   2015   2016   2017 $5,300  $5,600  $9,700  $8,800  $9,000  The Company’s Capital Investment at Each Site is SubstantialEach Gamma Knife, PBRT or IGRT devicerequires a substantial capital investment. In some cases, we contribute additional funds for capital costs and/or annual operatingand equipment related costs such as marketing, maintenance, insurance and property taxes. Due to the structure of our contractswith medical centers, there can be no assurance that these costs will be fully recovered or that we will earn a satisfactory returnon our investment. The Market for the Gamma Knife is LimitedThere is a limited marketfor the Gamma Knife, and the market in the United States may be mature. The Company has begun operation at only four (4) new GammaKnife sites in the United States since 2011. An additional new site is scheduled to begin operation in the second half of 2017.Due to the substantial costs of acquiring a Gamma Knife unit, we must identify medical centers that possess neurosurgery and radiationoncology departments capable of performing a large number of Gamma Knife procedures. As of December 31, 2016, there were approximately123 operating Gamma Knife units in the United States, of which 17 units were owned by the Company. As of December 31, 2016, theCompany has two idle Gamma Knife units with a cumulative net book value of $1,483,000. One unit was traded in during 2016 to placea new unit at a new customer site in 2017. The Company plans to trade the second unit in for a new unit or place this units ata new site. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in placing these idle units or additional units at any sitesin the future. The Company’s existing contracts with its customers are fixed in length and there can be no assurance thatthe customers will wish to extend the contract beyond the end of the term.  13   The Company Has a High Level of DebtThe Company’s business is capital intensive.The Company finances its Gamma Knife units through its GKF subsidiary. The amounts financed through GKF have been generally non-recourseto ASHS. The Company financed its first proton therapy unit through its wholly owned subsidiary, Orlando, and guaranteed the leasefinancing. The Company’s combined long term debt and capital leases totaled $27,036,000 as of December 31, 2016 and is collateralizedby its Gamma Knife, MEVION S250 and other assets, including accounts receivable and future proceeds from any contract between theCompany and any end user of the financed equipment. This high level of debt may adversely affect the Company’s ability tosecure additional credit in the future, and as a result may affect operations and profitability. If default on debt occurs in thefuture, the Company’s creditors would have the ability to accelerate the defaulted loan, to seize the Gamma Knife or MEVIONS250 units or other equipment with respect to which default has occurred, and to apply any collateral they may have at the timeto cure the default. A Small Number of Customers Account fora Major Portion of our RevenuesA limited number of customers have historicallyaccounted for a substantial portion of the Company’s total revenue, and the Company expects such customer concentration tocontinue for the foreseeable future. For example, in 2016, seven (7) customers in total accounted for more than 50% of the Company’srevenue. The loss of a significant customer or a significant decline in the business from the Company’s largest customerscould have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations. During 2016, one of the Company’sseven largest customers provided notice of their intent to exercise the option to purchase the Gamma Knife unit at their hospitalat the end of the lease term in April 2017. The Company is placing two other Gamma Knife units in the second half of 2017, butthe loss of the contract could cause fluctuations in revenue from quarter to quarter. The Market for the Company’s Servicesis CompetitiveThe Company estimates that there are two othercompanies that actively provide alternative, non-conventional Gamma Knife financing to potential customers. We believe there areno competitor companies that currently have more than three (3) Gamma Knife units in operation. The Company’s relationshipwith Elekta, the manufacturer of the Leksell Gamma Knife unit, is non-exclusive, and in the past the Company has lost sales tocustomers that chose to purchase a Gamma Knife unit directly from Elekta. The Company also has several competitors in the financingof proton therapy projects. The Company’s business model differs from its competitors, but there can be no assurances thatthe Company will not lose placements to its competitors. In addition, the Company may continue to lose future sales to customerspurchasing equipment directly from manufacturers.

There can be no assurancethat the Company will be able to secure a sufficient number of future sites or Gamma Knife procedures to sustain its profitabilityand growth. International OperationsThe Company has plans to install, in 2017,a Gamma Knife in Peru. The Company sold its operations in Turkey on June 10, 2014. International operations can be subject to exchangerate volatility which could have an adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows. In addition, international operationscan be subject to legal and regulatory uncertainty and political and economic instability, which could result in problems assertingproperty or contractual rights, potential tariffs, increased compliance costs, increased regulatory scrutiny, potential adversetax consequences, the inability to repatriate funds to the United States, and the Company’s inability to operate in thoselocations. New Technology and Products Could Resultin Equipment ObsolescenceThere is constant change and innovation inthe market for highly sophisticated medical equipment.

RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information in thisreport, the following factors could affect our future business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position, and couldcause future results to differ materially from those expressed in any of the forward-looking statements contained in this report. The Federal Reimbursement Rate for GammaKnife Treatments Has Been Substantially ReducedIn April 2013, the Medicare reimbursement ratefor Gamma Knife services was lowered by nearly 60% (from $7,910 to $3,300) per treatment session. This sudden reduction in a ratethat had historically been stable resulted in a significant decrease in the Company’s revenues from all of our revenue sharingand some of our fixed fee medical centers. The reimbursement rate was subsequently increased by approximately 9% in 2014 and increasedagain in 2015. The 2015 reimbursement level is comparable to the level in effect prior to 2013.

As in the Gamma Knife business, new and improved IGRT equipment can be introduced that could make the existing technologyobsolete and that would make it uneconomical to operate. The Company Has Invested in a Proton BeamBusiness that is Developmental We have committed a substantial amount of ourfinancial resources to next-generation proton beam technology. The first MEVION S250 system began treating patients in December2013. We have committed to purchase three MEVION S250 systems, and have already made deposits of $5,000,000 towards this commitment.There can be no assurance that we will be able to finance these machines and if we do, that we won’t recover this investmentor future investments, or our $2,709,000 common stock investment in Mevion. To date, we have been unable to finalize permanentfinancing for these units. 14   The Trading Volume of Our Common Stock isLowAlthough our common stock is listed on theNYSE MKT, our common stock has experienced low trading volume, both historically and recently. Reported average daily trading volumein our common stock for the three-month period ended December 31, 2014 was approximately 6,700 shares. There is no reason to thinkthat a more active trading market in our common stock will develop in the future. Limited trading volume subjects our common stockto greater price volatility and may make it difficult for you to sell your shares in a quantity or at a price that is attractiveto you. "
8,AMS,AMERICAN SHARED HSPTL SERV,2014-03-31,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS In addition to the other information inthis report, the following factors could affect our future business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position, andcould cause future results to differ materially from those expressed in any of the forward-looking statements contained in thisreport. The Federal Reimbursement Rate for GammaKnife Treatments Has Been Substantially ReducedThe American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012,enacted by Congress on January 2, 2013 included a provision that reduced Medicare’s reimbursement rate for Gamma Knife servicesby nearly 60% (from $7,910 to $3,300 per treatment session) beginning April 1, 2013. This reduced the revenues under the Company’ssix contracts where payments are based on reimbursement rates to its medical center customers. It also resulted in the revisionof contracts at three (3) medical centers with fixed fee contracts to reflect the decreased reimbursement revenues to be receivedby the hospitals. These changes will adversely affect the Company’s Gamma Knife revenues and overall financial results inthe future. 13  The Company’s Capital Investment at Each Site is SubstantialEach radiosurgical or radiation therapydevice requires a substantial capital investment. In some cases, we contribute additional funds for capital costs and/or annualoperating and equipment related costs such as marketing, maintenance, insurance and property taxes. Due to the structure of ourcontracts with medical centers, there can be no assurance that these costs will be fully recovered or that we will earn a satisfactoryreturn on our investment. The Market for the Gamma Knife is LimitedThere is a limited market for the GammaKnife, and the market in the United States may be mature. The Company has begun operation at only seven new Gamma Knife sitesin the United States since 2004. Due to the substantial costs of acquiring a Gamma Knife unit, we must identify medical centersthat possess neurosurgery and radiation oncology departments capable of performing a large number of Gamma Knife procedures. Asof December 31, 2013, there were approximately 130 operating Gamma Knife units in the United States, of which 17 units were ownedby us. There are more than 300 units in operation worldwide, and the Company owned two operational international units as of December31, 2013. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in placing additional units at any sites in the future. The Company’sexisting contracts with its customers are fixed in length and there can be no assurance that the customers will wish to extendthe contract beyond the end of the term. The Company Has a High Level of DebtThe Company’s business is capitalintensive. The Company finances an IGRT system through ASHS and its Gamma Knife units and another IGRT system through its GKF subsidiary.The amounts financed through GKF have been generally non-recourse to ASHS. The Company’s combined long term debt and presentvalue of capital leases totals $32,461,000 as of December 31, 2013 and is collateralized by the Gamma Knife and IGRT equipmentand other assets, including accounts receivable and future proceeds from any contract between the Company and any end user of thefinanced equipment. This high level of debt may adversely affect the Company’s ability to secure additional credit in thefuture, and as a result may affect operations and profitability. If default on debt occurs in the future, the Company’s creditorswould have the ability to accelerate the defaulted loan, to seize the Gamma Knife unit or other equipment with respect to whichdefault has occurred, and to apply any collateral they may have at the time to cure the default. The Company also has a line ofcredit with a bank, against which it has drawn $8,840,000 as of December 31, 2013. A Small Number of Customers Accountfor a Major Portion of our RevenuesA limited number of customers have historicallyaccounted for a substantial portion of the Company’s total revenue, and the Company expects such customer concentration tocontinue for the foreseeable future. For example, in 2013, two customers each accounted for more than 10% of the Company’srevenue, and six customers in total accounted for more than 50% of the Company’s revenue. The loss of a significant customeror a significant decline in the business from the Company’s largest customers could have a material adverse effect on theCompany’s business and results of operations. The Market for the Company’s Servicesis CompetitiveThe Company estimates that there are threeother companies that actively provide alternative, non-conventional Gamma Knife financing to potential customers. We believe thereare no competitor companies that currently have more than three Gamma Knife units in operation. The Company’s relationshipwith Elekta, the manufacturer of the Leksell Gamma Knife unit, is non-exclusive, and in the past the Company has lost sales tocustomers that chose to purchase a Gamma Knife unit directly from Elekta. In addition, the Company may continue to lose futuresales to such customers and may also lose future sales to its competitors. There can be no assurance that the Company will beable to successfully compete against others in placing future units. There are Alternatives to the GammaKnifeOther radiosurgery devices and conventionalneurosurgery compete against the Gamma Knife. Each of the medical centers targeted by the Company could decide to acquire anotherradiosurgery device instead of a Gamma Knife. In addition, neurosurgeons who are primarily responsible for referring patientsfor Gamma Knife surgery may not be willing to make such referrals for various reasons, instead opting for invasive surgery. Therecan be no assurance that the Company will be able to secure a sufficient number of future sites or Gamma Knife procedures to sustainits profitability and growth. 14  International OperationsThe Company has made an effort to expandits operations internationally and has active or projected operations in Turkey and Peru. International operations can be subjectto exchange rate volatility which could have an adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows. For instance, the debtfor our Turkish operation is denominated in U.S. dollars, but the funds generated to pay the debt are in Turkish lira, so our abilityto repay the debt is subject to exchange rate exposure. In addition, international operations can be subject to legal and regulatoryuncertainty and political and economic instability, which could result in problems asserting property or contractual rights, potentialtariffs, increased compliance costs, increased regulatory scrutiny, potential adverse tax consequences, the inability to repatriatefunds to the United States, and the Company’s inability to operate in those locations. New Technology and Products Could Resultin Equipment ObsolescenceThere is constant change and innovationin the market for highly sophisticated medical equipment. New and improved medical equipment can be introduced that could makethe Gamma Knife technology obsolete and that would make it uneconomical to operate. During 2000, Elekta introduced an upgradedGamma Knife which cost approximately $3.6 million plus applicable tax and duties. This upgrade includes an Automatic PositioningSystem™ (“APS”), and therefore involves less health care provider intervention. In early 2005, Elekta introduceda new upgrade, the Gamma Knife Model 4C (“Model 4C”). The cost to upgrade existing units to the Model 4C with APS isestimated to be approximately $200,000 to $1,000,000, depending on the current Gamma Knife configuration. In 2006 Elekta introduceda new model of the Gamma Knife, the Perfexion, which costs approximately $4.5 million plus applicable taxes and duties. The Perfexioncan perform procedures faster than previous Gamma Knife models and it provides the additional ability to perform procedures onareas of the cervical spine. Existing models of the Gamma Knife are not upgradeable to the Perfexion model. As of March 1, 2014,14 of the Company’s Gamma Knife units are Perfexion models; of the Company’s remaining Gamma Knife units, three areModel 4C with APS and two are upgradeable to more advanced Model 4C units. The failure to acquire or use new technology and productscould have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, there are constant advancesmade in radiation therapy equipment. The Company purchased IGRT and CT Simulator systems in 2006 with a list price of approximately$8,300,000.

This will reduce the revenues under the Company’s five contracts where payments are based onreimbursement rates to its medical center customers. It may also cause the 12 medical centers with fixed fee contracts to seekto restructure these arrangements to reflect the decreased reimbursement revenues to be received by the hospitals. These changeswill adversely affect the Company’s Gamma Knife revenues and overall financial results in the future. The Company is seekinga legislative solution, but there can be no assurance these efforts will result in a delay or elimination of the decrease in reimbursementrates. 13  The Company’s Capital Investment at Each Site is SubstantialEach radiosurgical or radiation therapydevice requires a substantial capital investment.

The reimbursement decrease may come from federallymandated programs (i.e., Medicare and Medicaid) or other third party payor groups. Thirteen of the Company’s nineteen existingcontracts in the United States are reimbursed by the medical center to the Company on a fee per use basis. The primary risk underthis type of contract is that the actual volume of procedures could be less than projected. However, a significant reimbursementrate reduction may result in the Company restructuring certain of its existing contracts. There are also six contracts in the UnitedStates where the Company receives revenue based directly on the amount of reimbursement received for procedures performed. Revenueunder those contracts and any future contracts with revenue based directly on reimbursement amounts will be impacted by any reimbursementrate change. Some of the Company’s future contracts for Gamma Knife services may have revenue based on such reimbursementrates instead of a fee per use basis. There can be no assurance that future changes in healthcare regulations and reimbursementrates will not directly or indirectly adversely affect the Company’s Gamma Knife revenue. New Technology and Products Could Resultin Equipment ObsolescenceThere is constant change and innovationin the market for highly sophisticated medical equipment.
