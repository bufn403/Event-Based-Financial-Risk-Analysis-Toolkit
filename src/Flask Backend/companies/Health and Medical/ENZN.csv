 You should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as other information in this Annual Report, including our financial statements and the related notes and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, as well as our other public filings. Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be impacted by one or more of the following factors, any of which could cause actual results to vary materially from historical and current results or anticipated future results.Risks Relating to the Company and its OperationsOur search for a business, company or assets to acquire or in which to invest may be unsuccessful, or it could result in a change of control, and we may fail to utilize the proceeds of our Rights Offering and/or realize the value of our NOLs.We are positioned as a public company acquisition vehicle, where we can become an acquisition platform and potentially utilize our NOLs and enhance stockholder value. Although we may acquire businesses, entities or revenue streams that could generate sufficient income so that we can utilize our approximately $102.5 million in federal NOLs, there can be no assurance we will be able to do so. In addition, we do not have any current plans, arrangements or understandings with respect to any acquisitions or investments, and we may pursue acquisitions that could result in a change of control of us. Although we have had significant discretion in the use of the net proceeds of our Rights Offering, it is possible that we may not utilize such proceeds and if a transaction is pursued that results in a change of control, as defined in the Certificate of Designation of the Series C Non-Convertible Preferred Stock, holders of the Series C Non-Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock will be entitled to redemption rights, and if exercised would require the Company to redeem such preferred stock. Further, if such change of control occurs, it would likely substantially limit the utilization of our NOLs. We cannot assure you that we will be able to realize the value of all or any of our NOLs.Our sources of revenue are limited and, as a result of our cash reserves, we expect only limited revenue and profitability for the foreseeable future; while we increased our cash reserve by completing the Rights Offering and generate revenue from such cash reserve, unanticipated liabilities and expenses could adversely affect our ability to engage in a public company acquisition or investment, as currently intended, or to continue operations.Prior to 2023, we incurred losses and, in 2023, our source of revenue was from interest income. We received approximately $43.1 million of net proceeds in the fourth quarter of 2020 from the Rights Offering, which we are using to position us as a public company acquisition vehicle, unless and until we can consummate an acquisition or investment that generates income, and other than interest income, we do not anticipate generating any additional cash or revenues. As interest rates may fluctuate in the future, there can be no assurance that we will continue to receive interest income at our existing levels, or at levels that allow us to achieve a profit. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate a profit based on our interest income. In addition, we have been informed by Merck that there will likely be no or minimal additional sales of PegIntron and we would likely receive no further significant royalties, although we may remain potentially liable to Merck for product returns and rebates. Based on current estimates, we do not expect any liability for those returns and rebates to be material. Moreover, our right to receive royalty revenues from other products is limited and we currently do not intend to acquire new sources of royalty revenues. For those remaining existing or potential sources of royalty revenue, our licensees may be unable to maintain regulatory approvals for currently licensed products or obtain regulatory approvals for new products. Safety issues could also result in the failure to maintain regulatory approvals or decrease revenues.While we have substantially reduced our operating expenses, including ceasing our research and development activities, eliminating our workforce in favor of independent contractors, and discontinuing our significant lease commitments, we may incur unanticipated liabilities or expenses, including expenses to defend unasserted product liability claims or greater than expected liabilities for PegIntron and expenses incurred in our search for a target business to acquire or in which to invest. Any such expenses or liabilities could impact the availability of assets that we expect to use to fund future operations or adversely affect our ability to pay dividends or make distributions to shareholders upon a liquidation of the Company.We have outsourced all corporate functions, which makes us more dependent on third parties to perform these corporate functions.We have outsourced all corporate functions, which makes us more dependent on third parties for the performance of these functions. To the extent that we are unable to effectively reallocate employee responsibilities, retain key officers as consultants, maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and effective disclosure controls and procedures, establish and maintain agreements 5Table of Contentswith competent third-party contractors on terms that are acceptable to us, or effectively manage the work performed by any retained third-party contractors, our ability to manage the operations effectively could be compromised. While we may, potentially, acquire businesses, entities or revenue streams that could generate sufficient income so that we can utilize our NOLs, we may be unable to do so and, accordingly, we may be unable to realize our deferred income tax assets.The ultimate realization of our deferred income tax assets is dependent upon generating future taxable income, executing tax planning strategies, and reversals of existing taxable temporary differences. We have recorded a partial valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets, which may fluctuate as conditions change. While we are positioned as a public company acquisition vehicle and may acquire businesses, entities or revenue streams that could generate sufficient income so that we can utilize our NOLs, we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to do so. If we fail to do so, approximately 97% of our current federal NOLs will expire by 2036 and more than 90% of our current federal NOLs will expire by the end of 2031. As a result of the expiration dates of our NOLs and our efforts to date to identify acquisition candidates, we may consider transactions that could result in a change of control of us in an effort to enhance stockholder value.Our ability to utilize our NOLs to offset our future taxable income and/or to recover previously paid taxes would be limited or could be non-existent if we were to undergo an “ownership change” within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. In general, an “ownership change” occurs whenever the percentage of the stock of a corporation owned by “5-percent shareholders” (within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code) increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the stock of such corporation owned by such “5-percent shareholders” at any time over the testing period.An ownership change under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code would establish an annual limitation to the amount of NOLs we could utilize to offset our taxable income in any single year. The application of these limitations might prevent full utilization of the deferred tax assets attributable to our NOLs. Although we have adopted a Section 382 rights plan in an effort to protect stockholder value by attempting to protect against a possible limitation on our ability to use our NOLs, we cannot assure you that we will not undergo an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382. (See Notes 9 and 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)Risks Relating to Our Common StockOur common stock ranks junior to our Series C Preferred Stock.With respect to the payment of cash dividends and amount payable in the event our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, our common stock will rank junior to our Series C Non-Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock (“Series C Preferred Stock”). This means that, unless full dividends have been (i) paid, (ii) redeemed in an amount in excess of the initial liquidation value of $1,000 per share of Series C Preferred Stock or (iii) set aside for payment on all outstanding Series C Preferred Stock for all dividends or increases in the liquidation value in excess of the initial liquidation amount of $1,000 of such Series C Preferred Stock, no cash dividends may be declared or paid on our common stock. Likewise, in the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, no distribution of our assets may be made to holders of our common stock until we have paid to the holders of our Series C Preferred Stock the liquidation preference related to such Series C Preferred Stock, plus in each case any accrued and unpaid dividends.In addition, the holders of Series C Preferred Stock have the right to demand that we redeem their shares in the event that we undergo a change of control. Accordingly, if such demands were made, there could be limited or no cash available to declare or make any dividends to holders of our common stock.The interests of our significant stockholders may conflict with the interests of other stockholders.Mr. Carl C. Icahn, directly and indirectly, beneficially owns approximately 49% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, as well as approximately 98% of the outstanding Series C Preferred Stock. Mr. Icahn may have interests that are different from, in addition to or not always consistent with our interests or with the interests of our other common or preferred stockholders. To the extent that conflicts of interest may arise between us and Mr. Icahn and his affiliates, those conflicts may be resolved in a manner adverse to us or our other stockholders. In addition, the existence of significant stockholders may have the effect of making it difficult for, or may discourage or delay, a third party from seeking to acquire a majority of our outstanding common stock, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, such stockholders may exert significant influence over our operations. Accordingly, the interests of these significant stockholders may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders, or otherwise be in the best interests of us or all stockholders.6Table of ContentsThe price of our common stock has historically been volatile and may decline significantly if we are unable to consummate a business acquisition or investment.Historically, the market price of our common stock has fluctuated over a wide range for a variety of reasons, including Company-specific factors and global and industry-wide conditions and events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting recession, as well as the fact that only a few stockholders, in the aggregate, hold more than a majority of our common stock, and, therefore, there is a small public float with limited trading activity in our common stock. In the future, the value of our common stock may be impacted by our lack of royalty revenues, our ability to monetize our remaining assets, including our NOLs, and any unexpected liabilities or expenses that impact our continued operations, our ability to pay dividends or make distributions to our stockholders and the success of any future activities which we undertake, including our ability to consummate a business acquisition or investment.In addition, financings that may be available to us under current market conditions frequently involve sales at prices below the prices at which our common stock currently trades on the OTCQX, as well as the issuance of warrants or convertible equity that require exercise or conversion prices that are calculated in the future at a discount to the then market price of our common stock.Our common stock is quoted on the OTCQX market of the OTC Markets Group, Inc., which has a very limited trading market and, therefore, market liquidity for our common stock is low and our stockholders’ ability to sell their shares of our common stock may be limited.Our common stock is quoted on the OTCQX market of the OTC Markets Group, Inc. and the quotation of our common stock on the OTCQX market does not assure that a liquid trading market exists or will develop. Stocks traded on the OTCQX market generally have very limited trading volume and exhibit a wider spread between the bid/ask quotations than stocks traded on national exchanges. Moreover, a significant number of institutional investors have investment policies that prohibit them from trading in stocks on the OTCQX marketplace. As a result, investors may find it difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations of the price of, our common stock. This significantly limits the liquidity of our common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.We do not currently, and are not expected in the future to, meet the listing standards of any national exchange. In addition, on January 17, 2024, we received a compliance deficiency notice from the OTCQX indicating that our stock’s bid price had closed below $0.10 for more than 30 consecutive calendar days and therefore no longer met the continued listing qualifications of the OTCQX. We were granted a 180-calendar day cure period, or until July 15, 2024, to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. In order to regain compliance, our bid price will need to stay at or above $0.10 for ten consecutive trading days. We will continue to monitor our compliance during the cure period and could undertake specific actions to address this minimum bid price deficiency, including but not limited to a reverse split of our shares of common stock. Alternatively, at the end of such cure period, it is possible we would be eligible for trading on the OTCQB and may apply for listing on such platform prior to such time. There can be no assurance that we will be able to become compliant with the continued listing qualifications rules of the OTCQX or become eligible to trade on OTCQB, and in such events, it is expected our shares of common stock would be eligible to trade on the OTC Pink Market.. As a result, investors must bear the economic risk of holding their shares of our common stock for an indefinite period of time. In the future, our common stock could become subject to “penny stock” rules which impose additional disclosure requirements on broker-dealers and could further negatively impact market liquidity for our common stock and our stockholders’ ability to sell their shares of our common stock.The declaration of common stock dividends is within the discretion of our Board, subject to any applicable limitations under Delaware corporate law, as well as the requirements of the Series C Preferred Stock. Our ability to pay dividends in the future depends on, among other things, our fulfillment of the conditions of the Series C Preferred Stock, declining royalty revenues, our ability to acquire other revenue sources and our ability to manage expenses, including costs relating to our ongoing operations.The declaration of dividends is within the discretion of our Board, subject to any applicable limitations under Delaware corporate law, and, therefore, our Board could decide in the future not to declare dividends. In addition, as described elsewhere, our common stock ranks junior to the Series C Preferred Stock, and we cannot declare or pay cash dividends on our common stock unless we satisfy the dividend requirements of such Series C Preferred Stock. Also, our ability to pay dividends in the future depends on, among other things, interest rates, our future revenues, including any revenues from existing and any future royalties and/or milestone payments, our ability to acquire other revenue sources and our ability to manage expenses, including costs relating to our ongoing operations. We expect little or no future royalties from existing products for which we have the right to receive royalties. In addition, while we may acquire or invest in businesses, entities or revenue streams and we may be entitled to a share of milestone and royalty payments from 7Table of Contentsthe approval and sale of Vicineum, we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so or that we will have sufficient royalty or milestone revenues to be able to pay dividends in the future.We have adopted a Section 382 rights plan, which may discourage a corporate takeover.On August 14, 2020, our Board of Directors adopted the Section 382 rights plan and declared a dividend distribution of one right for each outstanding share of our common stock to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 24, 2020. Each share of our common stock issued thereafter will also include one right. Each right entitles its holder, under certain circumstances, to purchase from us one one-thousandth of a share of our Series A-1 Junior Participating Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $1.20 per right, subject to adjustment.The Board adopted the Section 382 rights plan in an effort to protect stockholder value by attempting to protect against a possible limitation on our ability to use our NOLs. We may utilize these NOLs in certain circumstances to offset future United States taxable income and reduce our United States federal income tax liability. Because the Section 382 rights plan could make it more expensive for a person to acquire a controlling interest in us, it could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control even if a change in control was in our stockholders’ interest.Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware corporate law may make it more difficult to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders.In addition to our Section 382 rights plan, provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware corporate law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders. These anti-takeover provisions include:●lack of a provision for cumulative voting in the election of directors;●the ability of our Board to authorize the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;●advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and●limitations on who may call a special meeting of stockholders.The provisions described above, our Section 382 rights plan and provisions of Delaware corporate law relating to business combinations with interested stockholders, along with the significant amount of common stock beneficially owned by Mr. Icahn, may discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us. These provisions may also discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring a large portion of our securities, or initiating a tender offer, even if our stockholders might receive a premium for their shares in the acquisition over the then current market price.Risks Related to the Series C Preferred StockIn the event of any dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of our Company, we may not be able to make distributions or payments in full to all the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock or, if required, we may not be able to redeem such shares.The Series C Preferred Stock ranks senior to our common stock, but we may in the future issue one or more series of preferred stock that ranks senior to, junior to or pari passu with our Series C Preferred Stock. In the event of any dissolution, liquidation, winding up or change of control of our Company, we may not be able to make distributions or payments in full to all the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock or, if requested by such holders upon a change of control, to redeem the Series C Preferred Stock, in which case holders of the Series C Preferred Stock could lose some or all of the entire value of their investment.The dividends on our Series C Preferred Stock can be paid either in cash or be paid in kind by increasing the liquidation value of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock.The terms of the Series C Preferred Stock allow dividends on the shares of Series C Preferred Stock to be paid either in cash or be paid in kind by increasing the liquidation value of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock and, therefore, allow the repayment of the principal and accrued dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock to be deferred until the earliest of the redemption of the Series C 8Table of ContentsPreferred Stock or upon our dissolution, liquidation or winding up. We may not have enough capital to repay the full amount of the principal and accrued dividends when the payment of principal and accrued dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock becomes due.The Series C Preferred Stock is equity and is subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities, and your interests may be diluted in the event we issue additional shares of preferred stock.Shares of the Series C Preferred Stock represent equity interests and do not constitute indebtedness. As such, the Series C Preferred Stock will rank junior to all of our indebtedness and other non-equity claims of our creditors with respect to assets available to satisfy our claims, including in our liquidation, dissolution or winding up. Our future debt, if any, may include restrictions on our ability to pay distributions to preferred stockholders. Unlike indebtedness, where principal and interest would customarily be payable on specified due dates, in the case of preferred stock such as the Series C Preferred Stock, dividends are payable only if declared by our Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof). Our ability to pay dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock may be limited by the terms of our agreements governing any future indebtedness and by the provisions of any other future agreements.Subject to limitations prescribed by Delaware law and our charter, our Board of Directors is authorized to issue, from our authorized but unissued shares of capital stock, preferred stock in such classes or series as our Board of Directors may determine and to establish from time to time the number of shares of preferred stock to be included in any such class or series. The issuance of additional shares of Series C Preferred Stock or additional shares of preferred stock designated as ranking on parity with the Series C Preferred Stock would dilute the interests of the holders of shares of the Series C Preferred Stock, and the issuance of shares of any class or series of our capital stock expressly designated as ranking senior to the Series C Preferred Stock or the incurrence of additional indebtedness could affect our ability to pay distributions on, redeem or pay the liquidation preference on the Series C Preferred Stock.The Series C Preferred Stock is not convertible into common stock.The Series C Preferred Stock is not convertible into shares of common stock and, therefore, holders of Series C Preferred Stock have no rights with respect to shares of our common stock. In addition, the Series C Preferred Stock accrues dividends at a fixed rate. Accordingly, an increase in market price of our common stock will not necessarily result in an increase in the value of the Series C Preferred Stock. The value of the Series C Preferred Stock may depend more on dividend and interest rates for other preferred stock, commercial paper and other investment alternatives and our actual and perceived ability to pay dividends on, and in the event of dissolution satisfy the liquidation preference with respect to, the Series C Preferred Stock.Holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock have no voting rights.Except as otherwise provided by law, the holders of Series C Preferred Stock have no special voting rights and their consent will not be required for taking any corporate action. As a result, all matters submitted to stockholders will be decided by the vote of holders of our common stock. Holders of Series C Preferred Stock have no ability to influence corporate matters and, as a result, we may take actions that holders of our Series C Preferred Stock do not view as preferable.There is no public market for the Series C Preferred Stock.There is no established public trading market for the Series C Preferred Stock, and we do not expect a market to develop. We do not currently intend to apply for listing of the Series C Preferred Stock on any securities exchange or recognized trading system. Purchasers of the Series C Preferred Stock may be unable to resell their shares of Series C Preferred Stock or sell them only at an unfavorable price for an extended period of time, if at all. "

 Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be impacted by one or more of the following factors, any of which could cause actual results to vary materially from historical and current results or anticipated future results.Risks Relating to the Company and its OperationsOur search for a business, company or assets to acquire or in which to invest may be unsuccessful, and we may fail to maximize our return on the proceeds of our Rights Offering and/or realize the value of our NOLs.We are positioned as a public company acquisition vehicle, where we can become an acquisition platform and more fully utilize our NOLs and enhance stockholder value. We intend to acquire profitable businesses, entities or revenue streams that will generate sufficient income so that we can utilize our approximately $103.8 million in federal NOLs. However, we do not have any current plans, arrangements or understandings with respect to any acquisitions or investments, and we have not identified any actionable acquisition candidates. We will have significant discretion in the use of the net proceeds of our Rights Offering, and it is possible that we will fail to maximize our return on such proceeds. While we expect that, ultimately, we will be successful in realizing the value of our NOLs, we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so.The COVID-19 pandemic may continue to disrupt the approval and manufacture of products for which we share the right to receive licensing fees, milestone payments and royalties and may negatively impact our search for an acquisition target, and the business and/or results of operations of any target business that we acquire or in which we invest.Despite continued progress in the administration of vaccines, both the continued outbreak of recent variants and the related containment measures that have been put in place across the globe, have had and are likely to continue to have a serious adverse impact on the global economy and may adversely affect our business operations. The ongoing global health crisis (including resurgences) resulting from the pandemic have disrupted, and continue to disrupt, the normal operations of many businesses, including restrictions such as the scale-back of business operations and/or the imposition of either quarantine or remote work requirements for employees, either by government order or on a voluntary basis. It is impossible to predict the effect and ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as the situation is continually evolving. The COVID-19 pandemic may continue to disrupt the global supply chain and may cause disruptions to our operations, financial condition and prospects.At the present time, our own business activities have been largely unaffected by COVID-19 restrictions as our workforce is comprised solely of independent contractors who are able to perform their duties remotely. However, these restrictions may impact the third parties who are responsible for obtaining final approval of and manufacturing product candidates for which we share the right to receive licensing fees, milestone payments and royalty revenues. If those third parties are required to curtail their business activities for a significant time, or if global supply chain disruptions impact their ability to procure needed resources, raw materials or components, our right to receive licensing fees, milestone payments or royalties could be materially and adversely affected. Additionally, the development timeline for product candidates that are pending FDA approval could be delayed if the agency is required to shift resources to the review and approval of candidates for treatment of COVID-19.5Table of ContentsIn addition, the business and/or results of operations of any potential target business, that we acquire or in which we invest, could be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, we may be unable to complete any such acquisitions or investments if continued concerns relating to COVID-19 restrict travel, limit the ability to have meetings with potential investors or the target company’s personnel, vendors and service providers are unavailable to negotiate and consummate a transaction in a timely manner or if COVID-19 causes a prolonged economic downturn. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our search for a business to acquire or in which to invest will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others. If the disruptions posed by COVID-19 or other matters of global concern continue for an extensive period of time, our ability to consummate a business acquisition or investment, or the business and/or results of operations of a target business with which we ultimately consummate an acquisition or investment, may be materially adversely affected.The degree to which the COVID-19 pandemic ultimately impacts our business and results of operations, including our ability to acquire profitable businesses, entities or revenue streams, will depend on future developments beyond our control, including the severity of the pandemic, the extent of actions to contain the virus, availability of a vaccine or other treatment, how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume and the severity and duration of any global economic recession resulting from the pandemic.Our sources of revenue are limited and we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future; while we increased our cash reserve by completing the Rights Offering, unanticipated liabilities and expenses could adversely affect our ability to engage in a public company acquisition or investment, as currently intended, or to continue operations.We have incurred losses in the current period and have limited sources of revenues. Although we received approximately $43.1 million of net proceeds in the fourth quarter of 2020 from the Rights Offering, which we are using to position us as a public company acquisition vehicle, unless and until we can consummate an acquisition or investment that generates income, we do not anticipate generating any additional cash or revenues. We have been informed by Merck that there will likely be no or minimal additional sales of PegIntron and we would likely receive no further significant royalties, although we may remain potentially liable to Merck for product returns and rebates. Based on current estimates, we do not expect any liability for those returns and rebates to be material. Moreover, our right to receive royalty revenues from other products is limited and we currently do not intend to acquire new sources of royalty revenues. For those remaining existing or potential sources of royalty revenue, our licensees may be unable to maintain regulatory approvals for currently licensed products or obtain regulatory approvals for new products. Safety issues could also result in the failure to maintain regulatory approvals or decrease revenues.While we have substantially reduced our operating expenses in anticipation of the decline in revenues, including ceasing our research and development activities, eliminating our workforce in favor of independent contractors, and discontinuing our significant lease commitments, we may incur unanticipated liabilities or expenses, including expenses to defend unasserted product liability claims or greater than expected liabilities for PegIntron and expenses incurred in our search for a target business to acquire or in which to invest. Any such expenses or liabilities could impact the availability of assets that we expect to use to fund future operations or adversely affect our ability to pay dividends or make distributions to shareholders upon a liquidation of the Company.We have outsourced all corporate functions, which makes us more dependent on third parties to perform these corporate functions.We have outsourced all corporate functions, which makes us more dependent on third parties for the performance of these functions. To the extent that we are unable to effectively reallocate employee responsibilities, retain key officers as consultants, maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and effective disclosure controls and procedures, establish and maintain agreements with competent third-party contractors on terms that are acceptable to us, or effectively manage the work performed by any retained third-party contractors, our ability to manage the operations effectively could be compromised. 6Table of ContentsWhile we intend to acquire profitable businesses, entities or revenue streams that will generate sufficient income so that we can utilize our NOLs, we may be unable to do so and, accordingly, we may be unable to realize our deferred income tax assets.The ultimate realization of our deferred income tax assets is dependent upon generating future taxable income, executing tax planning strategies, and reversals of existing taxable temporary differences.

While we are positioned as a public company acquisition vehicle and intend to acquire profitable businesses, entities or revenue streams that will generate sufficient income so that we can utilize our NOLs, we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to do so. If we fail to do so, more than 90% of our current federal NOLs will expire by the end of 2031.In addition, our ability to utilize our NOLs to offset our future taxable income and/or to recover previously paid taxes would be limited if we were to undergo an “ownership change” within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. In general, an “ownership change” occurs whenever the percentage of the stock of a corporation owned by “5-percent shareholders” (within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code) increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the stock of such corporation owned by such “5-percent shareholders” at any time over the testing period.An ownership change under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code would establish an annual limitation to the amount of NOLs we could utilize to offset our taxable income in any single year.

In the future, our common stock could become subject to “penny stock” rules which impose additional disclosure requirements on broker-dealers and could further negatively impact market liquidity for our common stock and our stockholders’ ability to sell their shares of our common stock.The declaration of common stock dividends is within the discretion of our Board, subject to any applicable limitations under Delaware corporate law, as well as the requirements of the Series C Preferred Stock. Our ability to pay dividends in the future depends on, among other things, our fulfillment of the conditions of the Series C Preferred Stock, declining royalty revenues, our ability to acquire other revenue sources and our ability to manage expenses, including costs relating to our ongoing operations.The declaration of dividends is within the discretion of our Board, subject to any applicable limitations under Delaware corporate law, and, therefore, our Board could decide in the future not to declare dividends. In addition, as described elsewhere, our common stock ranks junior to the Series C Preferred Stock, and we cannot declare or pay cash dividends on our common stock unless we satisfy the dividend requirements of such Series C Preferred Stock. Also, our ability to pay dividends in the future depends on, among other things, interest rates, our future revenues, including any revenues from existing and any future royalties and/or milestone payments, our ability to acquire other revenue sources and our ability to manage expenses, including costs relating to our ongoing operations. We expect little or no future royalties from existing products for which we have the right to receive royalties. In addition, while we intend to acquire or invest in profitable businesses, entities or revenue streams and we may be entitled to a share of milestone and royalty payments from the approval and sale of Vicineum, we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so or that we will have sufficient royalty or milestone revenues to be able to pay dividends in the future.We have adopted a Section 382 rights plan, which may discourage a corporate takeover.On August 14, 2020, our Board of Directors adopted the Section 382 rights plan and declared a dividend distribution of one right for each outstanding share of our common stock to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 24, 2020. Each share of our common stock issued thereafter will also include one right. Each right entitles its holder, under certain circumstances, to purchase from us one one-thousandth of a share of our Series A-1 Junior Participating Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $1.20 per right, subject to adjustment.The Board adopted the Section 382 rights plan in an effort to protect stockholder value by attempting to protect against a possible limitation on our ability to use our NOLs. We may utilize these NOLs in certain circumstances to offset future United States taxable income and reduce our United States federal income tax liability. Because the Section 382 rights plan could make it more expensive for a person to acquire a controlling interest in us, it could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control even if a change in control was in our stockholders’ interest.8Table of ContentsAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware corporate law may make it more difficult to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders.In addition to our Section 382 rights plan, provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware corporate law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders. These anti-takeover provisions include:●lack of a provision for cumulative voting in the election of directors;●the ability of our Board to authorize the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;●advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and●limitations on who may call a special meeting of stockholders.The provisions described above, our Section 382 rights plan and provisions of Delaware corporate law relating to business combinations with interested stockholders, along with the significant amount of common stock beneficially owned by Mr. Icahn, may discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us. These provisions may also discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring a large portion of our securities, or initiating a tender offer, even if our stockholders might receive a premium for their shares in the acquisition over the then current market price.Risks Related to the Series C Preferred StockIn the event of any dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of our Company, we may not be able to make distributions or payments in full to all the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock or, if required, we may not be able to redeem such shares.The Series C Preferred Stock ranks senior to our common stock, but we may in the future issue one or more series of preferred stock that ranks senior to, junior to or pari passu with our Series C Preferred Stock. In the event of any dissolution, liquidation, winding up or change of control of our Company, we may not be able to make distributions or payments in full to all the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock or, if required, to redeem the Series C Preferred Stock, in which case holders of the Series C Preferred Stock could lose the entire value of their investment.The dividends on our Series C Preferred Stock can be paid either in cash or be paid in kind by increasing the liquidation value of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock.The terms of the Series C Preferred Stock allow dividends on the shares of Series C Preferred Stock to be paid either in cash or be paid in kind by increasing the liquidation value of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock and, therefore, allow the repayment of the principal and accrued dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock to be deferred until the earliest of the redemption of the Series C Preferred Stock or upon our dissolution, liquidation or winding up. We may not have enough capital to repay the full amount of the principal and accrued dividends when the payment of principal and accrued dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock becomes due.The Series C Preferred Stock is equity and is subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities, and your interests may be diluted in the event we issue additional shares of preferred stock.Shares of the Series C Preferred Stock represent equity interests and do not constitute indebtedness. As such, the Series C Preferred Stock will rank junior to all of our indebtedness and other non-equity claims of our creditors with respect to assets available to satisfy our claims, including in our liquidation, dissolution or winding up. Our future debt, if any, may include restrictions on our ability to pay distributions to preferred stockholders. Unlike indebtedness, where principal and interest would customarily be payable on specified due dates, in the case of preferred stock such as the Series C Preferred Stock, dividends are payable only if declared by our Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof). Our ability to pay dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock may be limited by the terms of our agreements governing any future indebtedness and by the provisions of any other future agreements.9Table of ContentsSubject to limitations prescribed by Delaware law and our charter, our Board of Directors is authorized to issue, from our authorized but unissued shares of capital stock, preferred stock in such classes or series as our Board of Directors may determine and to establish from time to time the number of shares of preferred stock to be included in any such class or series. The issuance of additional shares of Series C Preferred Stock or additional shares of preferred stock designated as ranking on parity with the Series C Preferred Stock would dilute the interests of the holders of shares of the Series C Preferred Stock, and the issuance of shares of any class or series of our capital stock expressly designated as ranking senior to the Series C Preferred Stock or the incurrence of additional indebtedness could affect our ability to pay distributions on, redeem or pay the liquidation preference on the Series C Preferred Stock.The Series C Preferred Stock is not convertible into common stock.The Series C Preferred Stock is not convertible into shares of common stock and, therefore, holders of Series C Preferred Stock have no rights with respect to shares of our common stock. In addition, the Series C Preferred Stock accrues dividends at a fixed rate. Accordingly, an increase in market price of our common stock will not necessarily result in an increase in the value of the Series C Preferred Stock. The value of the Series C Preferred Stock may depend more on dividend and interest rates for other preferred stock, commercial paper and other investment alternatives and our actual and perceived ability to pay dividends on, and in the event of dissolution satisfy the liquidation preference with respect to, the Series C Preferred Stock.Holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock have no voting rights.Except as otherwise provided by law, the holders of Series C Preferred Stock have no special voting rights and their consent will not be required for taking any corporate action. As a result, all matters submitted to stockholders will be decided by the vote of holders of our common stock. Holders of Series C Preferred Stock have no ability to influence corporate matters and, as a result, we may take actions that holders of our Series C Preferred Stock do not view as preferable.There is no public market for the Series C Preferred Stock.There is no established public trading market for the Series C Preferred Stock, and we do not expect a market to develop. We do not currently intend to apply for listing of the Series C Preferred Stock on any securities exchange or recognized trading system. Purchasers of the Series C Preferred Stock may be unable to resell their shares of Series C Preferred Stock or sell them only at an unfavorable price for an extended period of time, if at all. "
11,ENZN,ENZON PHARMACEUTICALS INC,2022-02-25,"Risk Factors
 Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be impacted by one or more of the following factors, any of which could cause actual results to vary materially from historical and current results or anticipated future results.Risks Relating to the Company and its OperationsOur search for a business, company or assets to acquire or in which to invest may be unsuccessful, and we may fail to maximize our return on the proceeds of our Rights Offering and/or realize the value of our NOLs.We are positioned as a public company acquisition vehicle, where we can become an acquisition platform and more fully utilize our NOLs and enhance stockholder value. We intend to acquire profitable businesses, entities or revenue streams that will generate sufficient income so that we can utilize our approximately $103.4 million NOLs. However, we do not have any current plans, arrangements or understandings with respect to any acquisitions or investments, and we have not identified any actionable acquisition candidates. We will have significant discretion in the use of the net proceeds of our Rights Offering, and it is possible that we will fail to maximize our return on such proceeds. While we expect that, ultimately, we will be successful in realizing the value of our NOLs, we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so.The COVID-19 pandemic may continue to disrupt the approval and manufacture of products for which we share the right to receive licensing fees, milestone payments and royalties and may negatively impact our search for an acquisition target, and the business and/or results of operations of any target business that we acquire or in which we invest.Despite recent progress in the administration of vaccines, both the outbreak of recent variants, including Delta and Omicron, and the related containment measures that have been put in place across the globe, have had and are likely to continue to have a serious adverse impact on the global economy and may adversely affect our business operations. The ongoing global health crisis (including resurgences) resulting from the pandemic have disrupted, and continue to disrupt, the normal operations of many businesses, including restrictions such as the temporary closure or scale-back of business operations and/or the imposition of either quarantine or remote work requirements for employees, either by government order or on a voluntary basis. It is impossible to predict the effect and ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as the situation is continually evolving. The COVID-19 pandemic may continue to disrupt the global supply chain and may cause disruptions to our operations, financial condition and prospects.At the present time, our own business activities have been largely unaffected by COVID-19 restrictions as our workforce is comprised solely of independent contractors who are able to perform their duties remotely. However, these restrictions may impact the third parties who are responsible for obtaining final approval of and manufacturing product candidates for which we share the right to receive licensing fees, milestone payments and royalty revenues. If those third parties are required to curtail their business activities for a significant time, or if global supply chain disruptions impact their ability to procure needed resources, raw materials or components, our right to receive licensing fees, milestone payments or royalties could be materially and adversely affected. Additionally, the development timeline for product candidates that are pending FDA approval could be delayed if the agency is required to shift resources to the review and approval of candidates for treatment of COVID-19.5In addition, the business and/or results of operations of any potential target business, that we acquire or in which we invest, could be materially and adversely affected. Furthermore, we may be unable to complete any such acquisitions or investments if continued concerns relating to COVID-19 restrict travel, limit the ability to have meetings with potential investors or the target company’s personnel, vendors and service providers are unavailable to negotiate and consummate a transaction in a timely manner or if COVID-19 causes a prolonged economic downturn. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our search for a business to acquire or in which to invest will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others. If the disruptions posed by COVID-19 or other matters of global concern continue for an extensive period of time, our ability to consummate a business acquisition or investment, or the business and/or results of operations of a target business with which we ultimately consummate an acquisition or investment, may be materially adversely affected.The degree to which the COVID-19 pandemic ultimately impacts our business and results of operations, including our ability to acquire profitable businesses, entities or revenue streams, will depend on future developments beyond our control, including the severity of the pandemic, the extent of actions to contain the virus, availability of a vaccine or other treatment, how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume and the severity and duration of any global economic recession resulting from the pandemic.Our sources of revenue are limited and we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future; while we increased our cash reserve by completing the Rights Offering, unanticipated liabilities and expenses could adversely affect our ability to engage in a public company acquisition or investment, as currently intended, or to continue operations.We have incurred losses in the current period and have limited sources of revenues. Although we received approximately $43.1 million of net proceeds in the fourth quarter of 2020 from the Rights Offering, which we intend to use to position us as a public company acquisition vehicle, unless and until we can consummate an acquisition or investment that generates income, we do not anticipate generating any additional cash or revenues. We have been informed by Merck that there will likely be no or minimal additional sales of PegIntron and we would likely receive no further significant royalties, although we may remain potentially liable to Merck for product returns and rebates. Based on current estimates, we do not expect any liability for those returns and rebates to be material. Moreover, our right to receive royalty revenues from other products is limited and we currently do not intend to acquire new sources of royalty revenues. For those remaining existing or potential sources of royalty revenue, our licensees may be unable to maintain regulatory approvals for currently licensed products or obtain regulatory approvals for new products. Safety issues could also result in the failure to maintain regulatory approvals or decrease revenues.While we have substantially reduced our operating expenses in anticipation of the decline in revenues, including ceasing our research and development activities, eliminating our workforce in favor of independent contractors, and discontinuing our significant lease commitments, we may incur unanticipated liabilities or expenses, including expenses to defend unasserted product liability claims or greater than expected liabilities for PegIntron and expenses incurred in our search for a target business to acquire or in which to invest. Any such expenses or liabilities could impact the availability of assets that we expect to use to fund future operations or adversely affect our ability to pay dividends or make distributions to shareholders upon a liquidation of the Company.We have outsourced all corporate functions, which makes us more dependent on third parties to perform these corporate functions.We have outsourced all corporate functions, which makes us more dependent on third parties for the performance of these functions. To the extent that we are unable to effectively reallocate employee responsibilities, retain key officers as consultants, maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and effective disclosure controls and procedures, establish and maintain agreements with competent third-party contractors on terms that are acceptable to us, or effectively manage the work performed by any retained third-party contractors, our ability to manage the operations effectively could be compromised. 6While we intend to acquire profitable businesses, entities or revenue streams that will generate sufficient income so that we can utilize our NOLs, we may be unable to do so and, accordingly, we may be unable to realize our deferred income tax assets.The ultimate realization of our deferred income tax assets is dependent upon generating future taxable income, executing tax planning strategies, and reversals of existing taxable temporary differences. We have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets, which may fluctuate as conditions change. While we are positioned as a public company acquisition vehicle and intend to acquire profitable businesses, entities or revenue streams that will generate sufficient income so that we can utilize our NOLs, we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to do so.In addition, our ability to utilize our NOLs to offset our future taxable income and/or to recover previously paid taxes would be limited if we were to undergo an “ownership change” within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. In general, an “ownership change” occurs whenever the percentage of the stock of a corporation owned by “5-percent shareholders” (within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code) increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the stock of such corporation owned by such “5-percent shareholders” at any time over the testing period.An ownership change under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code would establish an annual limitation to the amount of NOLs we could utilize to offset our taxable income in any single year. The application of these limitations might prevent full utilization of the deferred tax assets attributable to our NOLs. Although we have adopted a Section 382 rights plan in an effort to protect stockholder value by attempting to protect against a possible limitation on our ability to use our NOLs, we cannot assure you that we will not undergo an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382. (See Notes 9 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.)Risks Relating to Our Common StockOur common stock ranks junior to our Series C Preferred Stock.With respect to the payment of cash dividends and amount payable in the event our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, our common stock will rank junior to our Series C Non-Convertible Redeemable Preferred Stock (“Series C Preferred Stock”).  This means that, unless full dividends have been (i)  paid, (ii) redeemed in an amount in excess of the initial liquidation value of $1,000 per share of Series C Preferred Stock or (iii) set aside for payment on all outstanding Series C Preferred Stock for all dividends or increases in the liquidation value in excess of the initial liquidation amount of $1,000 of such Series C Preferred Stock, no cash dividends may be declared or paid on our common stock. Likewise, in the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, no distribution of our assets may be made to holders of our common stock until we have paid to the holders of our Series C Preferred Stock the liquidation preference related to such Series C Preferred Stock, plus in each case any accrued and unpaid dividends.The interests of our significant stockholders may conflict with the interests of other stockholders.Mr. Carl C. Icahn, directly and indirectly, beneficially owns approximately 49% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, as well as approximately 98% of the outstanding Series C Preferred Stock. Mr. Icahn may have interests that are different from, in addition to or not always consistent with our interests or with the interests of our other common or preferred stockholders. To the extent that conflicts of interest may arise between us and Mr. Icahn and his affiliates, those conflicts may be resolved in a manner adverse to us or our other stockholders. In addition, the existence of significant stockholders may have the effect of making it difficult for, or may discourage or delay, a third party from seeking to acquire a majority of our outstanding common stock, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, such stockholders may exert significant influence over our operations.The price of our common stock has historically been volatile and may decline significantly if we are unable to consummate a business acquisition or investment.Historically, the market price of our common stock has fluctuated over a wide range for a variety of reasons, including Company-specific factors and global and industry-wide conditions and events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting recession, as well as the fact that only a few stockholders, in the aggregate, hold more than a majority of our 7common stock, and, therefore, there is a small public float with limited trading activity in our common stock. In the future, the value of our common stock may be impacted by our declining royalty revenues, our ability to monetize our remaining assets, including our NOLs, and any unexpected liabilities or expenses that impact our continued operations, our ability to pay dividends or make distributions to our stockholders and the success of any future activities which we undertake, including our ability to consummate a business acquisition or investment.In addition, financings that may be available to us under current market conditions frequently involve sales at prices below the prices at which our common stock currently trades on the OTCQX, as well as the issuance of warrants or convertible equity that require exercise or conversion prices that are calculated in the future at a discount to the then market price of our common stock.Our common stock is quoted on the OTCQX market of the OTC Markets Group, Inc., which has a very limited trading market and, therefore, market liquidity for our common stock is low and our stockholders’ ability to sell their shares of our common stock may be limited.Our common stock is quoted on the OTCQX market of the OTC Markets Group, Inc. and the quotation of our common stock on the OTCQX market does not assure that a liquid trading market exists or will develop. Stocks traded on the OTCQX market generally have very limited trading volume and exhibit a wider spread between the bid/ask quotations than stocks traded on national exchanges. Moreover, a significant number of institutional investors have investment policies that prohibit them from trading in stocks on the OTCQX marketplace. As a result, investors may find it difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations of the price of, our common stock. This significantly limits the liquidity of our common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.We do not currently, and are not expected in the future to, meet the listing standards of any national exchange. We presently anticipate that our common stock will continue to be quoted on the OTCQX market. As a result, investors must bear the economic risk of holding their shares of our common stock for an indefinite period of time. In the future, our common stock could become subject to “penny stock” rules which impose additional disclosure requirements on broker-dealers and could further negatively impact market liquidity for our common stock and our stockholders’ ability to sell their shares of our common stock.The declaration of common stock dividends is within the discretion of our Board, subject to any applicable limitations under Delaware corporate law, as well as the requirements of the Series C Preferred Stock. Our ability to pay dividends in the future depends on, among other things, our fulfillment of the conditions of the Series C Preferred Stock, declining royalty revenues, our ability to acquire other revenue sources and our ability to manage expenses, including costs relating to our ongoing operations.The declaration of dividends is within the discretion of our Board, subject to any applicable limitations under Delaware corporate law, and, therefore, our Board could decide in the future not to declare dividends. In addition, as described elsewhere, our common stock ranks junior to the Series C Preferred Stock, and we cannot declare or pay cash dividends on our common stock unless we satisfy the dividend requirements of such Series C Preferred Stock. Also, our ability to pay dividends in the future depends on, among other things, our future revenues, including any revenues from existing and any future royalties and/or milestone payments, our ability to acquire other revenue sources and our ability to manage expenses, including costs relating to our ongoing operations. We expect little or no future royalties from existing products for which we have the right to receive royalties. In addition, while we intend to acquire or invest in profitable businesses, entities or revenue streams and we may be entitled to a share of milestone and royalty payments from the approval and sale of Vicineum, we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so or that we will have sufficient royalty or milestone revenues to be able to pay dividends in the future.We have adopted a Section 382 rights plan, which may discourage a corporate takeover.On August 14, 2020, our Board of Directors adopted the Section 382 rights plan and declared a dividend distribution of one right for each outstanding share of our common stock to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 24, 2020. Each share of our common stock issued thereafter will also include one right. Each right entitles its holder, under certain circumstances, to purchase from us one one-thousandth of a share of our Series A-1 Junior Participating Preferred Stock at an exercise price of $1.20 per right, subject to adjustment.8The Board adopted the Section 382 rights plan in an effort to protect stockholder value by attempting to protect against a possible limitation on our ability to use our NOLs. We may utilize these NOLs in certain circumstances to offset future United States taxable income and reduce our United States federal income tax liability. Because the Section 382 rights plan could make it more expensive for a person to acquire a controlling interest in us, it could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control even if a change in control was in our stockholders’ interest.Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware corporate law may make it more difficult to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders.In addition to our Section 382 rights plan, provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware corporate law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders. These anti-takeover provisions include:●lack of a provision for cumulative voting in the election of directors;●the ability of our Board to authorize the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;●advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and●limitations on who may call a special meeting of stockholders.The provisions described above, our Section 382 rights plan and provisions of Delaware corporate law relating to business combinations with interested stockholders, along with the significant amount of common stock beneficially owned by Mr. Icahn, may discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us. These provisions may also discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring a large portion of our securities, or initiating a tender offer, even if our stockholders might receive a premium for their shares in the acquisition over the then current market price.Risks Related to the Series C Preferred StockIn the event of any dissolution, liquidation, or winding up of our Company, we may not be able to make distributions or payments in full to all the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock or, if required, we may not be able to redeem such shares.The Series C Preferred Stock ranks senior to our common stock, but we may in the future issue one or more series of preferred stock that ranks senior to, junior to or pari passu with our Series C Preferred Stock. In the event of any dissolution, liquidation, winding up or change of control of our Company, we may not be able to make distributions or payments in full to all the holders of the Series C Preferred Stock or, if required, to redeem the Series C Preferred Stock, in which case holders of the Series C Preferred Stock could lose the entire value of their investment.The dividends on our Series C Preferred Stock can be paid in kind by increasing the liquidation value of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock.The terms of the Series C Preferred Stock allow dividends on the shares of Series C Preferred Stock to be paid in kind by increasing the liquidation value of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock and, therefore, allow the repayment of the principal and accrued dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock to be deferred until the earliest of the redemption of the Series C Preferred Stock or upon our dissolution, liquidation or winding up. We may not have enough capital to repay the full amount of the principal and accrued dividends when the payment of principal and accrued dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock becomes due.9The Series C Preferred Stock is equity and is subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities, and your interests may be diluted in the event we issue additional shares of preferred stock.Shares of the Series C Preferred Stock represent equity interests and do not constitute indebtedness. As such, the Series C Preferred Stock will rank junior to all of our indebtedness and other non-equity claims of our creditors with respect to assets available to satisfy our claims, including in our liquidation, dissolution or winding up. Our future debt may include restrictions on our ability to pay distributions to preferred stockholders. Unlike indebtedness, where principal and interest would customarily be payable on specified due dates, in the case of preferred stock such as the Series C Preferred Stock, dividends are payable only if declared by our Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof). Our ability to pay dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock may be limited by the terms of our agreements governing future indebtedness and by the provisions of other future agreements.Subject to limitations prescribed by Delaware law and our charter, our Board of Directors is authorized to issue, from our authorized but unissued shares of capital stock, preferred stock in such classes or series as our Board of Directors may determine and to establish from time to time the number of shares of preferred stock to be included in any such class or series. The issuance of additional shares of Series C Preferred Stock or additional shares of preferred stock designated as ranking on parity with the Series C Preferred Stock would dilute the interests of the holders of shares of the Series C Preferred Stock, and the issuance of shares of any class or series of our capital stock expressly designated as ranking senior to the Series C Preferred Stock or the incurrence of additional indebtedness could affect our ability to pay distributions on, redeem or pay the liquidation preference on the Series C Preferred Stock.The Series C Preferred Stock is not convertible into common stock.The Series C Preferred Stock is not convertible into shares of common stock and, therefore, holders of Series C Preferred Stock have no rights with respect to shares of our common stock. In addition, the Series C Preferred Stock accrues dividends at a fixed rate. Accordingly, an increase in market price of our common stock will not necessarily result in an increase in the value of the Series C Preferred Stock. The value of the Series C Preferred Stock may depend more on dividend and interest rates for other preferred stock, commercial paper and other investment alternatives and our actual and perceived ability to pay dividends on, and in the event of dissolution satisfy the liquidation preference with respect to, the Series C Preferred Stock.Holders of shares of Series C Preferred Stock have no voting rights.Except as otherwise provided by law, the holders of Series C Preferred Stock have no special voting rights and their consent will not be required for taking any corporate action. As a result, all matters submitted to stockholders will be decided by the vote of holders of our common stock. Holders of Series C Preferred Stock have no ability to influence corporate matters and, as a result, we may take actions that holders of our Series C Preferred Stock do not view as preferable.There is no public market for the Series C Preferred Stock.There is no established public trading market for the Series C Preferred Stock, and we do not expect a market to develop. We do not currently intend to apply for listing of the Series C Preferred Stock on any securities exchange or recognized trading system. Purchasers of the Series C Preferred Stock may be unable to resell their shares of Series C Preferred Stock or sell them only at an unfavorable price for an extended period of time, if at all. "
3,ENZN,ENZON PHARMACEUTICALS INC,2021-02-23,"Risk Factors
 Our business, financialcondition and results of operations may be impacted by one or more of the following factors, any of which could cause actual resultsto vary materially from historical and current results or anticipated future results.  6   Risks Relating tothe Company and its Operations Our search for a business, company orassets to acquire or in which to invest may be unsuccessful, and we may fail to maximize our return on the proceeds of our RightsOffering and/or realize the value of our NOLs. We are positioned asa public company acquisition vehicle, where we can become an acquisition platform and more fully utilize our NOLs and enhance stockholdervalue. We intend to acquire profitable businesses, entities or revenue streams that will generate sufficient income so that wecan utilize our approximately $103 million NOLs. However, we do not have any current plans, arrangements or understandings withrespect to any acquisitions or investments, and we have not identified any actionable acquisition candidates. We will have significantdiscretion in the use of the net proceeds of our Rights Offering, and it is possible that we will fail to maximize our return onsuch proceeds. While we expect that, ultimately, we will be successful in realizing the value of our NOLs, we cannot assure youthat we will be able to do so. The COVID-19 pandemic may disrupt theapproval and manufacture of products for which we share the right to receive licensing fees, milestone payments and royalties andmay negatively impact our search for an acquisition target, and the business and/or results of operations of any target businessthat we acquire or in which we invest. In December 2019,an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was reported in Wuhan, China. On March 11, 2020, the WorldHealth Organization characterized the global spread of COVID-19 as a pandemic. In an effort to slow the spread of the virus, theUnited States and many other countries around the world imposed restrictions on non-essential work activities, travel and massgatherings. Although these restrictions have been eased in some areas, it is not known whether these lockdowns and other restrictionswill be reintroduced, especially in light of the uncertainty regarding cases in the United States, when they will end or the ultimateimpact these unprecedented actions will have on our financial condition and prospects. At the present time,our own business activities have been largely unaffected by COVID-19 restrictions as our workforce is comprised solely of independentcontractors who are able to perform their duties remotely. However, these restrictions may impact the third parties who are responsiblefor obtaining final approval of and manufacturing product candidates for which we share the right to receive licensing fees,milestone payments and royalty revenues. If those third parties are required to curtail their business activities for a significanttime, or if global supply chain disruptions impact their ability to procure needed resources, raw materials or components,our right to receive licensing fees, milestone payments or royalties could be materially and adversely affected. Additionally,the development timeline for product candidates that are pending FDA approval could be delayed if the agency is required to shiftresources to the review and approval of candidates for treatment of COVID-19. In addition, the businessand/or results of operations of any potential target business, that we acquire or in which we invest, could be materially and adverselyaffected. Furthermore, we may be unable to complete any such acquisitions or investments if continued concerns relating to COVID-19restrict travel, limit the ability to have meetings with potential investors or the target company’s personnel, vendors andservice providers are unavailable to negotiate and consummate a transaction in a timely manner or if COVID-19 causes a prolongedeconomic downturn, including the duration of the ongoing economic conditions. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our search fora business to acquire or in which to invest will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted,including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat itsimpact, among others. If the disruptions posed by COVID-19 or other matters of global concern continue for an extensive periodof time, our ability to consummate a business acquisition or investment, or the business and/or results of operations of a targetbusiness with which we ultimately consummate an acquisition or investment, may be materially adversely affected.  7   The degree to whichthe COVID-19 pandemic ultimately impacts our business and results of operations, including our ability to acquire profitable businesses,entities or revenue streams, will depend on future developments beyond our control, including the severity of the pandemic, theextent of actions to contain the virus, availability of a vaccine or other treatment, how quickly and to what extent normal economicand operating conditions can resume and the severity and duration of the global economic challenges resulting from the pandemic. Our sources of revenue are limited andwe expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future; while we increased our cash reserve by completing the Rights Offering, unanticipatedliabilities and expenses could adversely affect our ability to engage in a public company acquisition or investment, as currentlyintended, or to continue operations. We have incurred lossesin the current period and have limited sources of revenues. Although we received approximately $43.1 million of net proceeds fromthe Rights Offering, which we intend to use to position us as a public company acquisition vehicle, unless and until we can consummatean acquisition or investment that generates income, or unless and until we begin receiving significant milestone and royalty paymentsthat may become due from the sale of Vicineum by Sesen Bio, Inc. (“Sesen”), we do not anticipate generating any additionalcash or revenues. We have been informed by Merck that there will likely be no or minimal additional sales of PegIntron and we wouldlikely receive no further significant royalties, although we may remain potentially liable to Merck for product returns and rebates.Based on current estimates, we do not expect any liability for those returns and rebates to be material. Moreover, our right toreceive royalty revenues from other products is limited and we currently do not intend to acquire new sources of royalty revenues.For those remaining existing or potential sources of royalty revenue, our licensees may be unable to maintain regulatory approvalsfor currently licensed products or obtain regulatory approvals for new products. Safety issues could also result in the failureto maintain regulatory approvals or decrease revenues. While we have substantiallyreduced our operating expenses in anticipation of the decline in revenues, including ceasing our research and development activities,eliminating our workforce in favor of independent contractors, and discontinuing our significant lease commitments, we may incurunanticipated liabilities or expenses, including expenses to defend unasserted product liability claims or greater than expectedliabilities for PegIntron and expenses incurred in our search for a target business to acquire or in which to invest. Any suchexpenses or liabilities could impact the availability of assets that we expect to use to fund future operations or adversely affectour ability to pay dividends or make distributions to shareholders upon a liquidation of the Company. We have outsourced all corporate functions,which makes us more dependent on third parties to perform these corporate functions. We have outsourcedall corporate functions, which makes us more dependent on third parties for the performance of these functions. To the extent thatwe are unable to effectively reallocate employee responsibilities, retain key officers as consultants, maintain effective internalcontrol over financial reporting and effective disclosure controls and procedures, establish and maintain agreements with competentthird-party contractors on terms that are acceptable to us, or effectively manage the work performed by any retained third-partycontractors, our ability to manage the operations effectively could be compromised. Our current CEO intends to retire from suchrole effective February 26, 2021, at which time our current CFO will also become our CEO.  8   While we intend to acquire profitablebusinesses, entities or revenue streams that will generate sufficient income so that we can utilize our NOLs, we may be unableto do so and, accordingly, we may be unable to realize our deferred income tax assets. The ultimate realizationof our deferred income tax assets is dependent upon generating future taxable income, executing tax planning strategies, and reversalsof existing taxable temporary differences. We have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets,which may fluctuate as conditions change. While we are positioned as a public company acquisition vehicle and intend to acquireprofitable businesses, entities or revenue streams that will generate sufficient income so that we can utilize our NOLs, we cannotprovide any assurance that we will be able to do so. In addition, our abilityto utilize our NOLs to offset our future taxable income and/or to recover previously paid taxes would be limited if we were toundergo an “ownership change” within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. In general, an “ownershipchange” occurs whenever the percentage of the stock of a corporation owned by “5-percent shareholders” (withinthe meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code) increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentageof the stock of such corporation owned by such “5-percent shareholders” at any time over the testing period. An ownership changeunder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code would establish an annual limitation to the amount of NOLs we could utilizeto offset our taxable income in any single year. The application of these limitations might prevent full utilization of the deferredtax assets attributable to our NOLs. Although we have adopted a Section 382 rights plan in an effort to protect stockholdervalue by attempting to protect against a possible limitation on our ability to use our NOLs, we cannot assure you that we willnot undergo an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382. (See Notes 9 and 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.) Risks Relating to Our Common Stock Our common stock ranks junior to ourSeries C Preferred Stock. With respect to thepayment of cash dividends and amount payable in the event our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, our common stock will rankjunior to our Series C Preferred Stock. This means that, unless full dividends(i) have been paid, (ii) redeemed in an amount in excess of the initial liquidation value of $1,000 or (iii) setaside for payment on all outstanding Series C Preferred Stock for all dividends or increases in the liquidation value in excessof the initial liquidation amount of $1,000 of such Series C Preferred Stock, no cash dividends may be declared or paid onour common stock. Likewise, in the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, no distributionof our assets may be made to holders of our common stock until we have paid to the holders of our Series C Preferred Stockthe liquidation preference related to such Series C Preferred Stock, plus in each case any accrued and unpaid dividends. The interests of our significant stockholdersmay conflict with the interests of other stockholders. Mr. Carl C. Icahn,directly and indirectly, beneficially owns approximately 49% of the outstanding shares of our common stock, as well as approximately98% of the outstanding Series C Preferred Stock. Mr. Icahn may have interests that are different from, in addition toor not always consistent with our interests or with the interests of our other common or preferred stockholders. To the extentthat conflicts of interest may arise between us and Mr. Icahn and his affiliates, those conflicts may be resolved in a manneradverse to us or our other stockholders. In addition, the existence of significant stockholders may have the effect of making itdifficult for, or may discourage or delay, a third party from seeking to acquire a majority of our outstanding common stock, whichmay adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In addition, such stockholders may exert significant influence overour operations.  9   The price of our common stock has historicallybeen volatile and may decline significantly if we are unable to consummate a business acquisition or investment or for other reasons. Historically, the marketprice of our common stock has fluctuated over a wide range for a variety of reasons, including Company-specific factors and globaland industry-wide conditions and events such as the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting recession, as well as the fact that only afew stockholders, in the aggregate, hold more than a majority of our common stock, and, therefore, there is a small public floatwith limited trading activity in our common stock. In the future, the value of our common stock may be impacted by the amount ofour royalty revenues or anticipation thereof, our ability to monetize our remaining assets, including our NOLs, and any unexpectedliabilities or expenses that impact our continued operations, our ability to pay dividends or make distributions to our stockholdersand the success of any future activities which we undertake, including, but not limited to, our ability to consummate a businessacquisition or investment. In addition, equityfinancings that may be available to us under current market conditions frequently involve sales at prices below the prices at whichour common stock currently trades on the OTCQX, as well as the issuance of warrants or convertible equity that require exerciseor conversion prices that are calculated in the future at a discount to the then market price of our common stock. Our common stock is quoted on the OTCQXmarket of the OTC Markets Group, Inc., which has a very limited trading market and, therefore, market liquidity for our commonstock is low and our stockholders’ ability to sell their shares of our common stock may be limited. Our common stock isquoted on the OTCQX market of the OTC Markets Group, Inc. and the quotation of our common stock on the OTCQX market does notassure that a liquid trading market exists or will develop. Stocks traded on the OTCQX market generally have very limited tradingvolume and exhibit a wider spread between the bid/ask quotations than stocks traded on national exchanges. Moreover, a significantnumber of institutional investors have investment policies that prohibit them from trading in stocks on the OTCQX marketplace.As a result, investors may find it difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations of the price of, our common stock.This significantly limits the liquidity of our common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.  10   We do not currently,and are not expected in the future to, meet the listing standards of any national exchange. We presently anticipate that our commonstock will continue to be quoted on the OTCQX market. As a result, investors must bear the economic risk of holding their sharesof our common stock for an indefinite period of time. In the future, our common stock could become subject to “penny stock”rules which impose additional disclosure requirements on broker-dealers and could further negatively impact market liquidityfor our common stock and our stockholders’ ability to sell their shares of our common stock. The declaration of common stock dividendsis within the discretion of our Board, subject to any applicable limitations under Delaware corporate law, as well as the requirementsof the Series C Preferred Stock. Our ability to pay dividends in the future depends on, among other things, our fulfillmentof the conditions of the Series C Preferred Stock, fluctuating royalty revenues, our ability to acquire other revenue sourcesand our ability to manage expenses, including costs relating to our ongoing operations. The declaration ofdividends is within the discretion of our Board, subject to any applicable limitations under Delaware corporate law, and, therefore,our Board could decide in the future not to declare dividends. In addition, as described elsewhere, our common stock ranks juniorto the Series C Preferred Stock, and we cannot declare or pay cash dividends on our common stock unless we satisfy the dividendrequirements of such Series C Preferred Stock. Also, our ability to pay dividends in the future depends on, among other things,our future revenues, including any revenues from existing and any future royalties and/or milestone payments, our ability to acquireother revenue sources and our ability to manage expenses, including costs relating to our ongoing operations. We expect littleor no future royalties from existing previously approved products for which we have the right to receive royalties. In addition,while we intend to acquire or invest in profitable businesses, entities or revenue streams and we may be entitled to a share ofmilestone and royalty payments from the approval and sale of Vicineum, we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so or thatwe will have sufficient royalty or milestone revenues to be able to pay dividends in the future. We have adopted a Section 382 rightsplan, which may discourage a corporate takeover. On August 14,2020, our Board of Directors adopted a Section 382 rights plan and declared a dividend distribution of one right for eachoutstanding share of our common stock to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 24, 2020. Each share ofour common stock issued thereafter will also include one right. Each right entitles its holder, under certain circumstances, topurchase from us one one-thousandth of a share of our Series A-1 Junior Participating Preferred Stock at an exercise priceof $1.20 per right, subject to adjustment. The Board adopted theSection 382 rights plan in an effort to protect stockholder value by attempting to protect against a possible limitation onour ability to use our NOLs. We may utilize these NOLs in certain circumstances to offset future United States taxable income andreduce our United States federal income tax liability. Because the Section 382 rights plan could make it more expensive fora person to acquire a controlling interest in us, it could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control even ifa change in control was in our stockholders’ interest. Anti-takeover provisions in our charterdocuments and under Delaware corporate law may make it more difficult to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficialto our stockholders. In addition to ourSection 382 rights plan, provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware corporatelaw, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders.These anti-takeover provisions include:  • lack of a provision for cumulative voting in the election of directors;  • the ability of our Board to authorize the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;  • advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the Board of Directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and  • limitations on who may call a special meeting of stockholders.  11   The provisions describedabove, our Section 382 rights plan and provisions of Delaware corporate law relating to business combinations with interestedstockholders, along with the significant amount of common stock beneficially owned by Mr. Icahn, may discourage, delay orprevent a third party from acquiring us. These provisions may also discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring alarge portion of our securities, or initiating a tender offer, even if our stockholders might receive a premium for their sharesin the acquisition over the then current market price. Risks Related to the Series C PreferredStock In the event of any dissolution, liquidation,or winding up of our Company, we may not be able to make distributions or payments in full to all the holders of the Series CPreferred Stock or, if required, we may not be able to redeem such shares. The Series C PreferredStock ranks senior to our common stock, but we may in the future issue one or more series of preferred stock that ranks seniorto, junior to or pari passu with our Series C Preferred Stock. In the event of any dissolution, liquidation,winding up or change of control of our Company, we may not be able to make distributions or payments in full to all the holdersof the Series C Preferred Stock or, if required, to redeem the Series C Preferred Stock, in which case holders of theSeries C Preferred Stock could lose all or a portion of the value of their investment. The dividends on our Series C PreferredStock can be paid in kind by increasing the liquidation value of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock. The terms of the Series CPreferred Stock allow dividends on the shares of Series C Preferred Stock to be paid in kind by increasing the liquidationvalue of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock and, therefore, allow the repayment of the initial liquidation value and accrueddividends on the Series C Preferred Stock to be deferred until the earliest of the redemption of the Series C PreferredStock or upon our dissolution, liquidation or winding up. We may not have enough capital to repay the full amount of the initialliquidation value and accrued dividends if the payment of initial liquidation value and accrued dividends on the Series CPreferred Stock becomes due. The Series CPreferred Stock is equity and is subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities, and your interestsmay be diluted in the event we issue additional shares of preferred stock. Sharesof the Series C Preferred Stock represent equity interests and do not constitute indebtedness. As such, the Series CPreferred Stock will rank junior to all of our indebtedness and other non-equity claims of our creditors with respect to assetsavailable to satisfy our claims, including in our liquidation, dissolution or winding up. Our future debt may include restrictionson our ability to pay distributions to preferred stockholders. Unlike indebtedness, where principal and interest would customarilybe payable on specified due dates, in the case of preferred stock such as the Series C Preferred Stock, dividends are payableonly if declared by our Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee thereof). Our ability to pay dividends on the Series CPreferred Stock may be limited by the terms of our agreements governing future indebtedness and by the provisions of other futureagreements. Subjectto limitations prescribed by Delaware law and our charter, our Board of Directors is authorized to issue, from our authorized butunissued shares of capital stock, preferred stock in such classes or series as our Board of Directors may determine and to establishfrom time to time the number of shares of preferred stock to be included in any such class or series. The issuance of additionalshares of Series C Preferred Stock or additional shares of preferred stock designated as ranking on parity with the Series CPreferred Stock would dilute the interests of the holders of shares of the Series C Preferred Stock, and the issuance of sharesof any class or series of our capital stock expressly designated as ranking senior to the Series C Preferred Stock or theincurrence of additional indebtedness could affect our ability to pay distributions on, redeem or pay the liquidation preferenceon the Series C Preferred Stock.  12   The Series CPreferred Stock is not convertible into common stock. TheSeries C Preferred Stock is not convertible into shares of common stock and, therefore, holders of Series C PreferredStock have no rights with respect to shares of our common stock. In addition, the Series C Preferred Stock accrues dividendsat a fixed rate. Accordingly, an increase in market price of our common stock will not necessarily result in an increase in thevalue of the Series C Preferred Stock. The value of the Series C Preferred Stock may depend more on dividend and interestrates for other preferred stock, commercial paper and other investment alternatives and our actual and perceived ability to paydividends on, and in the event of dissolution satisfy the liquidation preference with respect to, the Series C Preferred Stock. Holders ofshares of Series C Preferred Stock have no voting rights. Exceptas otherwise provided by law, the holders of Series C Preferred Stock have no special voting rights and their consent willnot be required for taking any corporate action. As a result, all matters submitted to stockholders will be decided by the voteof holders of our common stock. Holders of Series C Preferred Stock have no ability to influence corporate matters and, asa result, we may take actions that holders of our Series C Preferred Stock do not view as preferable. There is nopublic market for the Series C Preferred Stock. Thereis no established public trading market for the Series C Preferred Stock, and we do not expect a market to develop. We donot currently intend to apply for listing of the Series C Preferred Stock on any securities exchange or recognized tradingsystem. Purchasers of the Series C Preferred Stock may be unable to resell their shares of Series C Preferred Stock orsell them only at an unfavorable price for an extended period of time, if at all.  13   "

 Throughout this AnnualReport on Form 10-K, we have made forward-looking statements in an attempt to better enable the reader to understand our futureprospects and make informed judgments. By their nature, forward-looking statements are subject to numerous factors that may influenceoutcomes or even prevent their eventual realization. Such factors may be external to the Company and entirely outside of our control. We cannot guaranteethat our assumptions and expectations will be correct. Failure of events to be achieved or of certain underlying assumptions toprove accurate could cause actual results to vary materially from past results and those anticipated or projected. We do not intendto update forward-looking statements. Certain risks and uncertaintiesare discussed below. However, it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Accordingly, you should not considerthis recitation to be complete. 7  Risks Relating to the Company and itsOperations Our sources of revenue are limited andwe expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future; unanticipated liabilities and expenses could adversely affect our abilityto continue operations or make expected distributions.  Wehave incurred losses in the current period and have limited sources of revenues. We have been informed by Merck that there willlikely be no or minimal additional sales of PegIntron and we would likely receive no further royalties, although we mayremain potentially liable to Merck for product returns and rebates. Based on current estimates, we do not expect any liabilityfor those returns and rebates to be material. Moreover, our right to receive royalty revenues from other products is limited andwe currently do not intend to acquire new sources of royalty revenues. For those remaining existing or potential sources of royaltyrevenue, our licensees may be unable to maintain regulatory approvals for currently licensed products or obtain regulatory approvalsfor new products. Safety issues could also result in the failure to maintain regulatory approvals or decrease revenues. While we have substantiallyreduced our operating expenses in anticipation of the decline in revenues – ceasing our research and development activities,eliminating our workforce in favor of independent contractors, and discontinuing our significant lease commitments – we mayincur unanticipated liabilities or expenses, including expenses to defend unasserted product liability claims or greater than expectedliabilities for PegIntron. Any such expenses or liabilities could impact the availability of assets that we expect to use to fundfuture operations or adversely affect our ability to pay dividends or make distributions to shareholders upon a liquidation ofthe Company. We have outsourced all corporate functions,which makes us more dependent on third parties to perform these corporate functions. We have outsourcedall corporate functions, which makes us more dependent on third parties for the performance of these functions. To the extent thatwe are unable to effectively reallocate employee responsibilities, retain key officers as consultants, maintain effective internalcontrol over financial reporting and effective disclosure controls and procedures, establish and maintain agreements with competentthird-party contractors on terms that are acceptable to us, or effectively manage the work performed by any retained third-partycontractors, our ability to manage the operations and planned liquidation of our business effectively could be compromised. Risks Relating to the Proposed Dissolutionand Liquidation The proposed dissolution and liquidationof the Company may not be completed in a timely manner or at all. On February 4, 2016,our Board adopted a Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution, pursuant to which we would, subject to obtainingrequisite stockholder approval, be liquidated and dissolved in accordance with Sections 280 and 281(a) of the General CorporationLaw of the State of Delaware. In approving the Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution, our Board had considered, amongother factors, our ability to obtain no-action relief from the SEC to suspend certain of our reportingobligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the anticipated cost savings if such relief is granted bythe SEC. After further consideration, our Board determined that it would be fair, advisable and in the best interestsof the Company and its stockholders to postpone seeking stockholder approval of the Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution until alater time to be determined by our Board. Fromtime to time, our Board reviews our status and prospects in deciding on the timing of our dissolutionand liquidation pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution. If our Board determines toseek stockholder approval of such plan and such plan is approved by our stockholders and implemented by us, it is expectedthat our corporate existence will continue for the purpose of winding up our business and affairs for at least three years.We have forecasted minimal or no royalty or milestone revenues for the foreseeable future. In light of the uncertainty as to whetherany of the milestones under the Micromet Marketing Agreement would be achieved, this forecast assumes that we would not receiveany milestone or royalty payments under the Micromet Marketing Agreement. 8  The amount we distribute to our stockholdersas liquidating distributions, if any, pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution may be substantially less than estimated. At present, we cannotdetermine with certainty the amount of any liquidating distribution to our stockholders if the Plan of Liquidation and Dissolutionis implemented. The amount of cash ultimately distributed to our stockholders in any liquidating distribution pursuant to the Planof Liquidation and Dissolution depends on, among other things, the amount of our liabilities, obligations and expenses and claimsagainst us, and the amount of the reserves that we establish during the liquidation process. Estimates of these amounts may beinaccurate. Factors that could impact these estimates include the following: (i) if any of the estimates regarding the Plan ofLiquidation and Dissolution, including the expenses to satisfy outstanding obligations, liabilities and claims during the liquidationprocess, are inaccurate, (ii) if litigation is brought against us or our directors and officers, if unforeseen claims are assertedagainst us, we will have to defend or resolve such claims or establish a reasonable reserve before making distributions to ourstockholders, (iii) if the estimates regarding the expenses to be incurred in the liquidation process, including expenses of personnelrequired and other operating expenses (including legal, accounting and other professional fees) necessary to dissolve and liquidatethe Company, are inaccurate and (iv) if we continue to incur significant expenses related to ongoing reporting obligations. We may not realize our deferred incometax assets. The ultimate realizationof our deferred income tax assets is dependent upon generating future taxable income, executing tax planning strategies, and reversalsof existing taxable temporary differences. We have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets.The valuation allowance may fluctuate as conditions change. Our ability to utilize net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwardsto offset our future taxable income and/or to recover previously paid taxes would be limited if we were to undergo an “ownershipchange” within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “IRC”). In general, an “ownershipchange” occurs whenever the percentage of the stock of a corporation owned by “5-percent shareholders” (withinthe meaning of Section 382 of the IRC) increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the stock of suchcorporation owned by such “5-percent shareholders” at any time over the testing period. An ownership changeunder Section 382 of the IRC would establish an annual limitation to the amount of NOL carryforwards we could utilize to offsetour taxable income in any single year. The application of these limitations might prevent full utilization of the deferred taxassets attributable to our NOL carryforwards. There can be no assurance that we will not undergo an ownership change within themeaning of Section 382. See Note 10 to Consolidated Financial Statements, included in Item 8 in this document.  Risks Relating to Our Common Stock  The price of our common stockhas been volatile and may decline significantly as we wind down our business operations. Historically, the marketprice of our common stock has fluctuated over a wide range for a variety of reasons, including company specific factors and globaland industry-wide conditions and events. In the future, the value of our common stock may be impacted by our decision to discontinueresearch and development activities, our declining royalty revenues, our ability to monetize our remaining assets, including ourNOLs, and any unexpected liabilities or expenses that impact our continued operations or ability to pay dividends or make distributionsto our shareholders.  Our common stock is quoted on the OTCQXmarket of the OTC Markets Group, Inc., which has a very limited trading market and, therefore, market liquidity for our commonstock is low and our stockholders’ ability to sell their shares of our common stock may be limited. Our common stock isquoted on the OTCQX market of the OTC Markets Group, Inc. and the quotation of our common stock on the OTCQX market does not assurethat a liquid trading market exists or will develop. Stocks traded on the OTCQX market generally have very limited trading volumeand exhibit a wider spread between the bid/ask quotations than stocks traded on national exchanges. Moreover, a significant numberof institutional investors have investment policies that prohibit them from trading in stocks on the OTCQX marketplace. As a result,investors may find it difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations of the price of, our common stock. This significantlylimits the liquidity of our common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 9  We do not currently,and are not expected in the future to, meet the listing standards of any national exchange. We presently anticipate that our commonstock will continue to be quoted on the OTCQX market. As a result, investors must bear the economic risk of holding their sharesof our common stock for an indefinite period of time. In the future, our common stock could become subject to “penny stock”rules which impose additional disclosure requirements on broker-dealers and could further negatively impact market liquidity forour common stock and our stockholders’ ability to sell their shares of our common stock. The declaration of dividends is withinthe discretion of our Board, subject to any applicable limitations under Delaware corporate law. Our ability to paydividends in the future depends on, among other things, our declining royalty revenues and our ability to manage expenses, includingcosts relating to our ongoing operations. In April 2013, weannounced that our Board intends to distribute excess cash, expected to arise from ongoing royalty revenues, in the form ofperiodic dividends to our stockholders. The declaration of dividends is within the discretion of our Board, subject to anyapplicable limitations under Delaware corporate law, and, therefore, our Board could decide in the future not to declaredividends. In addition, our ability to pay dividends in the future depends on, among other things, our future revenues fromexisting and any future royalties and/or milestone payments and our ability to manage expenses, including costs relating toour ongoing operations. Our future revenues from existing royalties have decreased sharply over the last several years andare expected to decline and eventually cease altogether due to eventual expirations over time of our right to receiveroyalties and milestones under the terms of our existing licensing arrangements. Therefore, we expect little or no futureroyalties from existing products for which we have the right to receive royalties. There is no assurance that we will havesufficient royalty or milestone revenues to be able to pay dividends in the future. Moreover, if we file a Plan ofLiquidation and Dissolution, the applicable Delaware court may impose limitations on our ability to declare dividends priorto the final dissolution of the Company. Our inability to pay dividends could cause the price of our common stock to declinesignificantly. Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents andunder Delaware corporate law may make it more difficult to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders. Provisions of our certificateof incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware corporate law, could make it more difficult for a third party toacquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders. These anti-takeover provisions include:  • lack of a provision for cumulative voting in the election of directors;  • the ability of our board to authorize the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;  • advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and  • limitations on who may call a special meeting of stockholders. The provisions describedabove and provisions of Delaware corporate law relating to business combinations with interested stockholders may discourage, delayor prevent a third party from acquiring us. These provisions may also discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiringa large portion of our securities, or initiating a tender offer, even if our stockholders might receive a premium for their sharesin the acquisition over the then current market price. Our previous Section 382 rights plan expiredon April 30, 2017 and has not been replaced. 10  "

If our Board of Directors determines toseek stockholder approval of such plan and such plan is approved by our stockholders and implemented by the Company, it is expectedthat our corporate existence will continue for the purpose of winding up our business and affairs for at least three years.We have forecasted minimal or no royalty or milestone revenues for the foreseeable future. In light of the uncertainty as to whetherany of the milestones under the Micromet Marketing Agreement would be achieved, this forecast assumes that we would not receiveany milestone or royalty payments under the Micromet Marketing Agreement. The amount we distribute to our stockholdersas liquidating distributions, if any, pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution may be substantially less than estimated. At present, we cannotdetermine with certainty the amount of any liquidating distribution to our stockholders if the Plan of Liquidation and Dissolutionis implemented. The amount of cash ultimately distributed to our stockholders in any liquidating distribution pursuant to the Planof Liquidation and Dissolution depends on, among other things, the amount of our liabilities, obligations and expenses and claimsagainst us, and the amount of the reserves that we establish during the liquidation process. Estimates of these amounts may beinaccurate. Factors that could impact these estimates include the following: (i) if any of the estimates regarding the Plan ofLiquidation and Dissolution, including the expenses to satisfy outstanding obligations, liabilities and claims during the liquidationprocess, are inaccurate, (ii) if litigation is brought against us or our directors and officers, if unforeseen claims are assertedagainst us, we will have to defend or resolve such claims or establish a reasonable reserve before making distributions to ourstockholders, (iii) if the estimates regarding the expenses to be incurred in the liquidation process, including expenses of personnelrequired and other operating expenses (including legal, accounting and other professional fees) necessary to dissolve and liquidatethe Company, are inaccurate and (iv) if we continue to incur significant expenses related to ongoing reporting obligations. Risks Relating to the Company and itsOperations Until 2017, in recent years, we derived most of our royaltyrevenues from continued sales of PegIntron, which have been in sharp decline and have been subject to recoupments for substantialreturns and rebates. In addition, our right to receive royalties on U.S. and European sales of PegIntron expired in 2016 and 2018,respectively, which has negatively impacted our royalty revenues. Until 2017, in recentyears, we had derived most of our royalty revenues from continued sales of PegIntron, which is marketed by Merck. Royaltyrevenues from sales of PegIntron accounted for approximately (2)% and 7% of our total royalty revenues in each of the years endedDecember 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, net of the effects of adjustments for Merck’s recoupment of previously overpaidroyalties. Sales of PegIntron have been in sharp decline in recent years, and our right to receive royalties on U.S. and Europeansales of PegIntron expired in 2016 and 2018, respectively, which adversely affected our operating results and financial position.As reported by Merck, sales declines were driven by lower volumes in nearly all regions as the availability of new therapeuticoptions resulted in continued loss of market share. It is unlikely that Merck will continue to generate sales of PegIntron at levelsthat would enable us to receive royalties in amounts that are comparable with the amounts of royalties that we have received inrecent years. In addition, product returns and rebates may limit future royalties and allow Merck to recoup prior paid royalties.Neither the amount nor timing of resources dedicated by Merck to the marketing of PegIntron nor Merck’s policies relatedto product returns and rebates is within our control. In addition, there are multiple oral drug therapies, both available and indevelopment, that have been effective for treatment of hepatitis C that do not require interferon. As a result, we expect thatsales of PegIntron-related products will continue their declining trend.  9   We may not be able to sustain profitabilityand we may incur losses over the next several years. We have incurred lossesin the past and have limited sources of revenues. Our revenues and operating results will likely fluctuate in future periods dueto variations in our recurring royalty revenues, which are expected to continue to decline. In anticipation of the revenue decline,we have commensurately reduced our operating expenses, including the cessation of our research and development activities, eliminationof our workforce, discontinuance of our significant lease commitment and the use of consultants in order to sustain profitability.However, with the sustained decline in revenue and the expectation of continued operating expenses, there can be no assurance thatwe will be successful in maintaining profitability. Certain of our rights to receive royaltieson sales of PegIntron and sales of other drug products have already expired and our remaining rights to receive royalties willexpire in the near future and we currently do not intend to acquire new sources of royalty revenues. Merck’s obligationto pay us royalties on sales of PegIntron terminates, on a country-by-country basis, upon the later of the date on which the lastpatent to contain a claim covering PegIntron expires in the country or 15 years after the date on which PegIntron was first approvedfor commercial marketing in such country. Our right to receive royalties on sales of PegIntron expired in the U.S. in 2016, expiredin Europe in 2018 and will expire in Malaysia in 2020, Japan in 2021 and Chile in 2024. We currently do not intend to acquire newsources of royalty revenues. As a result, following expirations of our rights to receive royalties on sales of PegIntron and salesof other drug products or potential drug products, we may not have sufficient revenues to continue operations. We may not realize our deferred incometax assets. The ultimate realizationof our deferred income tax assets is dependent upon generating future taxable income, executing tax planning strategies, and reversalsof existing taxable temporary differences. We have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets.The valuation allowance may fluctuate as conditions change. Our ability to utilize net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwardsto offset our future taxable income and/or to recover previously paid taxes would be limited if we were to undergo an “ownershipchange” within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “IRC”). In general, an “ownershipchange” occurs whenever the percentage of the stock of a corporation owned by “5-percent shareholders” (withinthe meaning of Section 382 of the IRC) increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the stock of suchcorporation owned by such “5-percent shareholders” at any time over the testing period. An ownership changeunder Section 382 of the IRC would establish an annual limitation to the amount of NOL carryforwards we could utilize to offsetour taxable income in any single year. The application of these limitations might prevent full utilization of the deferred taxassets attributable to our NOL carryforwards. There can be no assurance that we will not undergo an ownership change within themeaning of Section 382. See Note 10 to our Financial Statements, included in Item 8 in this document. We have outsourced all corporate functions,which makes us more dependent on third parties to perform these corporate functions. We have outsourcedall corporate functions, which makes us more dependent on third parties for the performance of these functions. To the extent thatwe are unable to effectively reallocate employee responsibilities, retain key officers as consultants, maintain effective internalcontrol over financial reporting and effective disclosure controls and procedures, establish and maintain agreements with competentthird-party contractors on terms that are acceptable to us, or effectively manage the work performed by any retained third-partycontractors, our ability to manage the operations of our business effectively could be compromised. We may be subject to a variety of typesof product liability or other claims based on allegations that the use of our product candidates by participants in our previouslyconducted clinical trials has resulted in adverse effects, and our insurance may not cover all product liability or other claims. We may face liabilityclaims related to the use or misuse of our product candidates in previously conducted clinical trials. These claims may be expensiveto defend and may result in large judgments against us. Any such claims against us, regardless of their merit, might result insignificant costs to defend or awards against us, and our insurance coverage and resources may not be sufficient to satisfy anyliability resulting from such claims. A successful product liability or other claim brought against us could cause the market priceof our common stock to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and materially harm ourbusiness, financial condition or results of operations.  10   We are party to license and other collaborationagreements that contain complex commercial terms that could result in disputes, litigation or indemnification liability that couldcause the value of the Company and our assets and the market price of our common stock to decline. We are party to license,collaboration and other agreements with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. These agreements contain complex commercialterms, including royalties on drug sales based on a number of complex variables (including net sales calculations, geography, scopeof patent claim coverage, patent life and other factors) and indemnification obligations. From time to time, we may have disputeresolution discussions with third parties regarding the appropriate interpretation of the complex commercial terms contained inour agreements. One or more disputes may arise or escalate in the future regarding our agreements that may ultimately result incostly litigation and unfavorable interpretation of contract terms, which could cause the value of the Company and our assets andthe market price of our common stock to decline. We are party to license agreements whereby we may receiveroyalties from products subject to regulatory approval. Our licensees may beunable to maintain regulatory approvals for currently licensed products or obtain regulatory approvals for new products. Safetyissues could also result in the failure to maintain regulatory approvals or decrease revenues. 11   Risks Relating to Our Common Stock The price of our common stock has been,and may continue to be, volatile. Historically, the marketprice of our common stock has fluctuated over a wide range, and it is likely that the price of our common stock will continue tobe volatile in the future. The market price of our common stock could be impacted due to a variety of factors, including, in additionto global and industry-wide events:  ·the level of revenues wegenerate from royalties we receive;·changes in our businessplans;·the losses we may incur;·developments in patentor other proprietary rights owned or licensed by us, our collaborative partners or our competitors;·public concern as to thesafety and efficacy of products developed by others; and·litigation. In addition, due toone or more of the foregoing factors in one or more future quarters, our results of operations may fall below the expectationsof securities analysts and investors. In that event, the market price of our common stock could materially decline. Our common stock is quoted on the OTCQXmarket of the OTC Markets Group, Inc., which has a very limited trading market and, therefore, market liquidity for our commonstock is low and our stockholders’ ability to sell their shares of our common stock may be limited. Our common stock isquoted on the OTCQX market of the OTC Markets Group, Inc. and the quotation of our common stock on the OTCQX market does not assurethat a liquid trading market exists or will develop. Stocks traded on the OTCQX market generally have very limited trading volumeand exhibit a wider spread between the bid/ask quotations than stocks traded on national exchanges. Moreover, a significant numberof institutional investors have investment policies that prohibit them from trading in stocks on the OTCQX marketplace. As a result,investors may find it difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations of the price of, our common stock. This significantlylimits the liquidity of our common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We do not currently,and are not expected in the future to, meet the listing standards of any national exchange. We presently anticipate that our commonstock will continue to be quoted on the OTCQX market. As a result, investors must bear the economic risk of holding their sharesof our common stock for an indefinite period of time. In the future, our common stock could become subject to “penny stock”rules which impose additional disclosure requirements on broker-dealers and could further negatively impact market liquidity forour common stock and our stockholders’ ability to sell their shares of our common stock.  The declaration of dividends is withinthe discretion of our Board of Directors, subject to any applicable limitations under Delaware corporate law. Our ability to paydividends in the future depends on, among other things, our future royalty revenues, which are expected to decrease sharply overthe next several years, as well as our ability to manage expenses, including costs relating to our ongoing operations. In April 2013, we announcedthat our Board of Directors intends to distribute excess cash, expected to arise from ongoing royalty revenues, in the form ofperiodic dividends to our stockholders. The declaration of dividends is within the discretion of our Board of Directors, subjectto any applicable limitations under Delaware corporate law, and, therefore, our Board of Directors could decide in the future notto declare dividends. In addition, our ability to pay dividends in the future depends on, among other things, our future revenuesfrom existing and any future royalties and/or milestone payments and our ability to manage expenses, including costs relating toour ongoing operations. Our future revenues from existing royalties have decreased sharply over the last several years and areexpected to continue to decrease sharply over the next several years (and eventually cease altogether) due to eventual expirationsover time of our right to receive royalties under the terms of our existing licensing arrangements. Future revenues from existingroyalties may also decline due to decreases in the sales of the drug products for which we have the right to receive royalties.There is no assurance that we will have sufficient royalty revenues to be able to pay dividends in the future. Moreover, if wefile a Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution, the applicable Delaware court may impose limitations on our ability to declare dividendsprior to the final dissolution of the Company. Any inability to pay dividends could cause the market price of our common stockto decline significantly.  12   Anti-takeover provisions in our charterdocuments and under Delaware corporate law may make it more difficult to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficialto our stockholders. Provisions of our certificateof incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware corporate law, could make it more difficult for a third party toacquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders. These anti-takeover provisions include: ·lack of a provision forcumulative voting in the election of directors;·the ability of our boardto authorize the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwarta takeover attempt;·advance notice requirementsfor nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholdermeetings; and·limitations on who maycall a special meeting of stockholders. The provisions describedabove and provisions of Delaware corporate law relating to business combinations with interested stockholders may discourage, delayor prevent a third party from acquiring us. These provisions may also discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiringa large portion of our securities, or initiating a tender offer, even if our stockholders might receive a premium for their sharesin the acquisition over the then current market price. Our previous Section 382 rights plan expiredon April 30, 2017 and has not been replaced. The issuance of preferred stock mayadversely affect rights of our common stockholders. Under our certificateof incorporation, our Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to three million shares of “blank check” preferredstock and to determine the price, rights, preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by ourstockholders. The rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to the rights of the holders of any shares of preferredstock that may be issued in the future. In addition to discouraging a takeover, as discussed above, this “blank check”preferred stock may have rights, including economic rights senior to the common stock, and, as a result, the issuance of such preferredstock could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock.  13   "

 Throughout this AnnualReport on Form 10-K, we have made forward-looking statements in an attempt to better enable the reader to understand our futureprospects and make informed judgments. By their nature, forward-looking statements are subject to numerous factors that may influenceoutcomes or even prevent their eventual realization. Such factors may be external to the Company and entirely outside our control. We cannot guaranteethat our assumptions and expectations will be correct. Failure of events to be achieved or of certain underlying assumptions toprove accurate could cause actual results to vary materially from past results and those anticipated or projected. We do not intendto update forward-looking statements. Certain risks and uncertaintiesare discussed below. However, it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Accordingly, you should not considerthis recitation to be complete.  12    Risks Relating to the Proposed Dissolutionand Liquidation The proposed dissolution and liquidationof the Company may not be completed in a timely manner or at all. On February 4, 2016,our Board of Directors adopted a Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution, pursuant to which the Company would, subject to obtainingrequisite stockholder approval, be liquidated and dissolved in accordance with Sections 280 and 281(a) of the General CorporationLaw of the State of Delaware. In approving the Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution, our Board of Directors had considered, amongother factors, the ability of the Company to obtain no-action relief from the SEC to suspend certain of the Company’s reportingobligations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the anticipated cost savings if such relief is granted bythe SEC. After further consideration, our Board of Directors determined that it would be fair, advisable and in the best interestsof the Company and its stockholders to postpone seeking stockholder approval of the Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution until alater time to be determined by our Board of Directors. The amount we distribute to our stockholdersas liquidating distributions, if any, pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution may be substantially less than estimated. At present, we cannotdetermine with certainty the amount of any liquidating distribution to our stockholders if the Plan of Liquidation and Dissolutionis implemented. The amount of cash ultimately distributed to our stockholders in any liquidating distribution pursuant to the Planof Liquidation and Dissolution depends on, among other things, the amount of our liabilities, obligations and expenses and claimsagainst us, and the amount of the reserves that we establish during the liquidation process. Estimates of these amounts may beinaccurate. Factors that could impact these estimates include the following: (i) if any of the estimates regarding the Plan ofLiquidation and Dissolution, including the expenses to satisfy outstanding obligations, liabilities and claims during the liquidationprocess, are inaccurate, (ii) if litigation is brought against us or our directors and officers, if unforeseen claims are assertedagainst us, we will have to defend or resolve such claims or establish a reasonable reserve before making distributions to ourstockholders, (iii) if the estimates regarding the expenses to be incurred in the liquidation process, including expenses of personnelrequired and other operating expenses (including legal, accounting and other professional fees) necessary to dissolve and liquidatethe Company, are inaccurate and (iv) if we continue to incur significant expenses related to ongoing reporting obligations. Risks Relating to the Company and itsOperations Until 2017, in recent years, we derivedmost of our royalty revenues from continued sales of PegIntron, which have been in sharp decline. In addition, our right to receiveroyalties on U.S. sales of PegIntron expired in 2016, which has negatively impacted our royalty revenues.  Until 2017, in recentyears, we had derived most of our royalty revenues from continued sales of PegIntron, which is marketed by Merck. Our right toreceive royalties on U. S. sales of PegIntron expired in 2016. Royalty revenues from sales of PegIntron accounted for approximately7% and 64% of our total royalty revenues in each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Sales of PegIntronhave been in sharp decline in recent years and our right to receive royalties on U.S. sales of PegIntron expired in 2016, whichadversely affected our operating results and financial position. As reported by Merck, sales declines were driven by lower volumesin nearly all regions as the availability of new therapeutic options resulted in continued loss of market share. We cannot assureyou that Merck will continue to generate sales of PegIntron at levels that would enable us to receive royalties in amounts thatare comparable with the amounts of royalties that we have received in recent years. The amount and timing of resources dedicatedby Merck to the marketing of PegIntron is not within our control. In addition, there are multiple oral drug therapies, both availableand in development, that have been effective for treatment of hepatitis C that don’t require interferon. As a result, weexpect that sales of PegIntron-related products will continue their declining trend. Our royalty revenues will be negatively affectedif sales of PegIntron are limited for any reason, including if Merck cannot market PegIntron effectively as a result of competitive,manufacturing, regulatory or other issues.  13    We may not be able to sustain profitabilityand we may incur losses over the next several years. We have incurred lossesin the past and have limited sources of revenues. Our revenues and operating results will likely fluctuate in future periods dueto variations in our royalty revenues, which are expected to decline rapidly. In anticipation of the revenue decline, we have commensuratelyreduced our operating expenses, including the cessation of our research and development activities, elimination of our workforce,discontinuance of our significant lease commitment and the use of consultants in order to sustain profitability. However, withthe sustained decline in revenue and the expectation of continued operating expenses, there can be no assurance that we will besuccessful in maintaining profitability. Certain of our rights to receive royaltieson sales of PegIntron and sales of other drug products have already expired and our remaining rights to receive royalties willexpire in the near future and we currently do not intend to acquire new sources of royalty revenues. Merck’s obligationto pay us royalties on sales of PegIntron terminates, on a country-by-country basis, upon the later of the date on which the lastpatent to contain a claim covering PegIntron expires in the country or 15 years after the date on which PegIntron was first approvedfor commercial marketing in such country. Our right to receive royalties on sales of PegIntron expired in the U.S. in 2016, andis expected to expire in Europe in 2018 and expire in Japan in 2021. We currently do not intend to acquire new sources of royaltyrevenues. As a result, following expirations of our rights to receive royalties on sales of PegIntron and sales of other drug productsor potential drug products, we may not have sufficient revenues to continue operations.  14    We may not realize our deferred incometax assets. The ultimate realizationof our deferred income tax assets is dependent upon generating future taxable income, executing tax planning strategies, and reversalsof existing taxable temporary differences. We have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets.The valuation allowance may fluctuate as conditions change. Our ability to utilize net operating losses (“NOL”) carryforwardsto offset our future taxable income and/or to recover previously paid taxes would be limited if we were to undergo an “ownershipchange” within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “IRC”). In general, an “ownershipchange” occurs whenever the percentage of the stock of a corporation owned by “5-percent shareholders” (withinthe meaning of Section 382 of the IRC) increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the stock of suchcorporation owned by such “5-percent shareholders” at any time over the testing period. An ownership changeunder Section 382 of the IRC would establish an annual limitation to the amount of NOL carryforwards we could utilize to offsetour taxable income in any single year. The application of these limitations might prevent full utilization of the deferred taxassets attributable to our NOL carryforwards. There can be no assurance that we will not undergo an ownership change within themeaning of Section 382. See Note 11 to our Financial Statements, included in Item 8 in this document. We have outsourced all corporatefunctions, which makes us more dependent on third-parties to perform these corporate functions. We have outsourcedall corporate functions, which makes us more dependent on third-parties for the performance of these functions. To the extentthat we are unable to effectively reallocate employee responsibilities, retain key officers as consultants, maintain effectiveinternal control over financial reporting and effective disclosure controls and procedures, establish and maintain agreements withcompetent third-party contractors on terms that are acceptable to us, or effectively manage the work performed by any retainedthird-party contractors, our ability to manage the operations of our business effectively could be compromised. We may be subject to a variety of typesof product liability or other claims based on allegations that the use of our product candidates by participants in our previouslyconducted clinical trials has resulted in adverse effects, and our insurance may not cover all product liability or other claims. We may face liabilityclaims related to the use or misuse of our product candidates in previously conducted clinical trials. These claims may be expensiveto defend and may result in large judgments against us. Any such claims against us, regardless of their merit, might result insignificant costs to defend or awards against us, and our insurance coverage and resources may not be sufficient to satisfy anyliability resulting from such claims. A successful product liability or other claim brought against us could cause the market priceof our common stock to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and materially harm ourbusiness, financial condition or results of operations.  15    Our revenues depend on patents and proprietaryrights, which may offer only limited protection against potential infringement and the development of competing products. The pharmaceuticalindustry places considerable importance on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for new technologies, products and processes.If we are unable to obtain and enforce patent protection for our product candidates, the value of our intellectual property portfoliocould be harmed. We have a portfolio of issued U.S. patents and filed applications, many of which have foreign counterparts. Althoughwe believe that our patents provide certain protection from competition, such patents may not provide substantial protection orcommercial benefit to us, or afford us adequate protection from competing products, and may be challenged or declared invalid.In addition, U.S. patents or foreign patent equivalents may not be issued to us in the future. Issued patents maybe challenged, invalidated or circumvented. In addition, court decisions may introduce uncertainty as to the enforceability orscope of patents owned by biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including us. The legal systems of certain countries do notfavor the aggressive enforcement of patents, and the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent asthe laws of the U.S. Therefore, enforceability or scope of our patents in the U.S. or in foreign countries cannot be predictedwith certainty, and, as a result, any patents that we own or license may not provide sufficient protection against competitors.In addition, we may not be able to obtain or maintain a patent from our pending patent applications, those we may file in the future,or those we may license from third parties. We believe that ourpatent rights are enforceable. However, those rights may prove unenforceable or invalid, or will expire. If we are not able toprotect our patent positions, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, which could adverselyaffect the market value of our common stock. We may become aware that certain organizations are engaging in activities that infringecertain of our patents. We may be unable to enforce our patents and other rights against such organizations. Legal or administrativeproceedings may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend against claims of infringement. We have inthe past been involved in patent litigation and other proceedings and we may become involved in additional patent litigation orproceedings in the future. If we become involved in any such litigation or proceeding, irrespective of the outcome, we may incursubstantial costs, and such disputes could substantially delay or prevent our commercialization activities, which could materiallyharm our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are party to license and other collaborationagreements that contain complex commercial terms that could result in disputes, litigation or indemnification liability that couldcause the value of the Company and our assets and the market price of our common stock to decline. We are party to license,collaboration and other agreements with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies.

Upon further review, the Company concluded that the SEC was not likely to grant such relief to the Company in 2016.Accordingly, after further consideration, our Board of Directors determined that it would be fair, advisable and in the best interestsof the Company and its stockholders to postpone seeking stockholder approval of the Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution untila later time to be determined by our Board of Directors. The amount we distribute to our stockholdersas liquidating distributions, if any, pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution may be substantially less than estimated. At present, we cannotdetermine with certainty the amount of any liquidating distribution to our stockholders if the Plan of Liquidation and Dissolutionis implemented. The amount of cash ultimately distributed to our stockholders in any liquidating distribution pursuant to thePlan of Liquidation and Dissolution depends on, among other things, the amount of our liabilities, obligations and expenses andclaims against us, and the amount of the reserves that we establish during the liquidation process. Estimates of these amountsmay be inaccurate. Factors that could impact these estimates include the following: (i) if any of the estimates regarding thePlan of Liquidation and Dissolution, including the expenses to satisfy outstanding obligations, liabilities and claims duringthe liquidation process, are inaccurate, (ii) if litigation is brought against us or our directors and officers, if unforeseenclaims are asserted against us, we will have to defend or resolve such claims or establish a reasonable reserve before makingdistributions to our stockholders, (iii) if the estimates regarding the expenses to be incurred in the liquidation process, includingexpenses of personnel required and other operating expenses (including legal, accounting and other professional fees) necessaryto dissolve and liquidate the Company, are inaccurate and (iv) if we continue to incur significant expenses related to ongoingreporting obligations. Risks Relating to the Company and its Operations We derive most of our royalty revenuesfrom continued sales of PegIntron, which have been in decline since 2008, and if sales of PegIntron continue to decline or salesof other drug products for which we receive royalty revenues materially decline, our results of operations and financial positioncould be materially harmed. We derive most ofour royalty revenues from continued sales of PegIntron, which is marketed by Merck. Our right to receive royalties on U. S.sales of PegIntron expired in 2016. Royalty revenues from sales of PegIntron accounted for approximately 64% and 80% ofour total royalty revenues in each of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Sales of PegIntron have beenin decline since 2008. As a consequence, a continued decline in the sales of PegIntron could adversely affect our operatingresults and financial position. Worldwide sales of PegIntron declined 65% to $63 million in 2016 compared with $182 millionin 2015, which was a decrease of 52% from 2014. As reported by Merck, sales declines were driven by lower volumes in nearlyall regions as the availability of new therapeutic options resulted in continued loss of market share. We cannot assure youthat Merck will continue to generate sales of PegIntron at levels that would enable us to receive royalties in amounts thatare comparable with the amounts of royalties that we have received in recent years. The amount and timing of resourcesdedicated by Merck to the marketing of PegIntron is not within our control. In addition, there are multiple oral drugtherapies, both available and in development, that have been effective for treatment of hepatitis C that don’t requireinterferon. As a result, it is likely that sales of PegIntron-related products will continue their declining trend. Ourroyalty revenues will be negatively affected if sales of PegIntron are limited for any reason, including if Merck cannotmarket PegIntron effectively as a result of competitive, manufacturing, regulatory or other issues.  13   Products that competewith PegIntron have been and potentially will be introduced by other drug manufacturers. Hoffmann-La Roche’s PEGASYS, acompeting PEGylated interferon alfa, has resulted in significant competitive pressure on PegIntron sales in the U.S. and all internationalmarkets. PEGASYS has taken market share away from PegIntron and the overall market for PEGylated alpha-interferon for the treatmentof hepatitis C has been contracting. As a result, sales of PegIntron in certain markets where it competes with PEGASYS and theroyalties we receive on those sales have declined. We cannot assure you that PEGASYS will not continue to gain market share atthe expense of PegIntron which could result in lower PegIntron sales and lower royalties to us. On December 6, 2013, theFDA approved Gilead’s Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) 400 mg tablets, a once-daily oral nucleotide analog polymerase inhibitor forthe treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection as a component of a combination antiviral treatment regimen. Sovaldi was approvedin combination with peg-interferon alpha and ribavirin for genotype 1 and 4 patients, and in combination with ribavirin for genotype2 and 3 patients. On January 17, 2014, the European Commission granted marketing authorization for Sovaldi. On October 10, 2014,the FDA approved Gilead’s Harvoni (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir), the first once-daily single tablet regimen for the treatmentof genotype 1 chronic hepatitis C infection, eliminating the need for interferon and ribavirin. On November 18, 2014, the EuropeanCommission granted marketing authorization for Harvoni. On December 19, 2014, the FDA approved Abbvie’s all-oral treatmentfor hepatitis C, and on January 16, 2015, the European Commission granted marketing authorization for this treatment. The adoptionof Sovaldi and other oral treatments for hepatitis C has had a negative impact on PegIntron revenues and we expect continued declinesin PegIntron revenues. There are several novel agents in various stages of preclinical and clinical development for the treatmentof hepatitis C, which either include or eliminate combination with pegylated interferon-based therapies. It is possible that thisresearch could lead to other competing products. We may not receive an Immunity Fee fromNektar for the sale of certain products InJune 2015, we delivered notice to Nektar Therapeutics, Inc. (“Nektar”) asserting a breach of our Cross-License andOption Agreement with Nektar for Nektar’s failure to pay an immunity fee that we believebecame payable under such agreement with respect to certain of our patents that would be infringed by Nektar’s products(or those of Nektar’s licensees). To date, Nektar has disputed our claim to an immunity fee.  On August 14, 2015, wefiled a summons and complaint against Nektar in the Supreme Court of the State of New York for breach of contract. On October23, 2015, Nektar filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. On February 2, 2016, the Court granted Nektar’s motionto dismiss the complaint. The Company appealed this dismissal and on October 25, 2016 the Appellate Division reversed and remandedthe case to the trial court for further proceedings. On November 28, 2016, Nektar served an amended answer and counterclaim allegingthat the patents at issue are unenforceable. While we believe that an immunity fee is currently dueand payable by Nektar and we intend to continue to pursue this claim, the outcome of such dispute is uncertain and there can beno assurance that we will be able to collect, in full or in part, the immunity fee or any future payments related thereto fromNektar. We may not be able to sustain profitabilityand we may incur losses over the next several years. We have incurred lossesin the past and have limited sources of revenues. Our revenues and operating results will likely fluctuate in future periods dueto variations in our royalty revenues, which are expected to decline rapidly. In anticipation of the revenue decline, we havecommensurately reduced our operating expenses, including the cessation of our research and development activities, eliminationof our workforce, discontinuance of our significant lease commitment and the use of consultants in order to sustain profitability.However, with the sustained decline in revenue and the expectation of continued operating expenses, there can be no assurancethat we will be successful in maintaining profitability. Our rights to receive royalties on salesof PegIntron and sales of other drug products will eventually expire and we currently do not intend on acquiring new sources ofroyalty revenues. Merck’sobligation to pay us royalties on sales of PegIntron terminates, on a country-by-country basis, upon the later of the date onwhich the last patent to contain a claim covering PegIntron expires in the country or 15 years after the date on whichPegIntron was first approved for commercial marketing in such country.   Our right to receive royalties on sales ofPegIntron expired in the U.S. in 2016, and is expected to expire in Europe in 2018 and expire in Japan in 2021.   Otherthan our rights to received immunity fees, our rights to receive royalties under our agreement with Nektar relating to CIMZIAand Macugen expired in the U.S. and Great Britain in 2014 and will expire inother countries by 2018. We currently do not intend to acquire new sources of royalty revenues.   As aresult, following expirations of our rights to receive royalties on sales of PegIntron and sales of other drug products, wemay not have sufficient revenues to continue operations.  14   We may not realize our deferred incometax assets. The ultimate realizationof our deferred income tax assets is dependent upon generating future taxable income, executing tax planning strategies, and reversalsof existing taxable temporary differences. We have recorded a partial valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets.The valuation allowance may fluctuate as conditions change. Our ability to utilize net operating losses (“NOL”) carryforwardsto offset our future taxable income and/or to recover previously paid taxes would be limited if we were to undergo an “ownershipchange” within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “IRC”). In general, an “ownershipchange” occurs whenever the percentage of the stock of a corporation owned by “5-percent shareholders” (withinthe meaning of Section 382 of the IRC) increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the stock ofsuch corporation owned by such “5-percent shareholders” at any time over the testing period. An ownership change underSection 382 of the IRC would establish an annual limitation to the amount of NOL carryforwards we could utilize to offset ourtaxable income in any single year. The application of these limitations might prevent full utilization of the deferred tax assetsattributable to our NOL carryforwards. To preserve our ability to utilize NOLs in the future without a Section 382 limitation,our Board of Directors adopted a Section 382 rights plan on April 30, 2014, which would be triggered upon certain transfers ofour securities. There can be no assurance that we will not undergo an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382. SeeNote 11 to our Financial Statements, included in Item 8 in this document. We have reallocated certain employmentresponsibilities and outsourced certain corporate functions, which make us more dependent on third-parties to perform these corporatefunctions. We have outsourced certaincorporate functions, which make us more dependent on third-parties for the performance of these functions. To the extent thatwe are unable to effectively reallocate employee responsibilities, retain key officers as consultants, maintain effective internalcontrol over financial reporting and effective disclosure controls and procedures, establish and maintain agreements with competentthird-party contractors on terms that are acceptable to us, or effectively manage the work performed by any retained third-partycontractors, our ability to manage the operations of our business effectively could be compromised. We may be subject to a variety of typesof product liability or other claims based on allegations that the use of our product candidates by participants in our previouslyconducted clinical trials has resulted in adverse effects, and our insurance may not cover all product liability or other claims. We may face liabilityclaims related to the use or misuse of our product candidates in previously conducted clinical trials. These claims may be expensiveto defend and may result in large judgments against us. Any such claims against us, regardless of their merit, might result insignificant costs to defend or awards against us, and our insurance coverage and resources may not be sufficient to satisfy anyliability resulting from such claims. A successful product liability or other claim brought against us could cause the marketprice of our common stock to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and materially harmour business, financial condition or results of operations.  15    Our revenues depend on patents andproprietary rights, which may offer only limited protection against potential infringement and the development of competingproducts. The pharmaceutical industryplaces considerable importance on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for new technologies, products and processes. Ifwe are unable to obtain and enforce patent protection for our product candidates or to maintain the confidentiality of our tradesecrets, the value of our intellectual property portfolio could be harmed. We have an extensive portfolio of issued U.S. patentsand filed applications, many of which have foreign counterparts. Although we believe that our patents provide certain protectionfrom competition, such patents may not provide substantial protection or commercial benefit to us, or afford us adequate protectionfrom competing products, and may be challenged or declared invalid. In addition, U.S. patents or foreign patent equivalents maynot be issued to us in the future. Issued patents may bechallenged, invalidated or circumvented. In addition, court decisions may introduce uncertainty as to the enforceability or scopeof patents owned by biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including us. The legal systems of certain countries do not favorthe aggressive enforcement of patents, and the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as thelaws of the U.S. Therefore, enforceability or scope of our patents in the U.S. or in foreign countries cannot be predicted withcertainty, and, as a result, any patents that we own or license may not provide sufficient protection against competitors. Inaddition, we may not be able to obtain or maintain a patent from our pending patent applications, those we may file in the future,or those we may license from third parties. We believe that our patentrights are enforceable. However, those rights may prove unenforceable or invalid, or will expire. If we are not able to protectour patent positions, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, which could adverselyaffect the market value of our common stock. We may become aware that certain organizations are engaging in activities that infringecertain of our patents. We may be unable to enforce our patents and other rights against such organizations. Legal or administrativeproceedings may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend against claims of infringement. We havein the past been involved in patent litigation and other proceedings and we may likely become involved in additional patent litigationor proceedings in the future. If we become involved in any such litigation or proceeding, irrespective of the outcome, we mayincur substantial costs, the efforts of our technical and management personnel may be diverted, and such disputes could substantiallydelay or prevent our product development or commercialization activities, which could materially harm our business, financialcondition and results of operations. We are party to license and other collaborationagreements that contain complex commercial terms that could result in disputes, litigation or indemnification liability that couldcause the value of the Company and our assets and the market price of our common stock to decline. We are party to license,collaboration and other agreements with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. These agreements contain complex commercialterms, including royalties on drug sales based on a number of complex variables (including net sales calculations, geography,scope of patent claim coverage, patent life and other factors) and indemnification obligations. From time to time, we may havedispute resolution discussions with third parties regarding the appropriate interpretation of the complex commercial terms containedin our agreements. One or more disputes may arise or escalate in the future regarding our agreements that may ultimately resultin costly litigation and unfavorable interpretation of contract terms, which could cause the value of the Company and our assetsand the market price of our common stock to decline.  16   We are party to license agreements whereby we may receive royaltiesfrom products subject to regulatory approval. Our licensees may be unableto maintain regulatory approvals for currently licensed products or obtain regulatory approvals for new products. Safety issuescould also result in the failure to maintain regulatory approvals or decrease revenues. Risks Relating to Our Common Stock The price of our common stock has been,and may continue to be, volatile. Historically, the marketprice of our common stock has fluctuated over a wide range, and it is likely that the price of our common stock will continueto be volatile in the future. The market price of our common stock could be impacted due to a variety of factors, including, inaddition to global and industry-wide events:  ·the    level of revenues we generate from royalties we receive; ·changes in our business    strategy; ·the losses we may    incur; ·developments in    patent or other proprietary rights owned or licensed by us, our collaborative partners or our competitors; ·public concern as    to the safety and efficacy of products developed by us or others; and ·litigation. In addition, due to oneor more of the foregoing factors in one or more future quarters, our results of operations may fall below the expectations ofsecurities analysts and investors. In that event, the market price of our common stock could materially decline. Our common stock is quoted on the OTCQXmarket of the OTC Markets Group, Inc., which has a very limited trading market and, therefore, market liquidity for our commonstock is low and our stockholders’ ability to sell their shares of our common stock may be limited. Our common stock is quoted on the OTCQXmarket of the OTC Markets Group, Inc. and the quotation of our common stock on the OTCQX market does not assure that a liquid tradingmarket exists or will develop. Stocks traded on the OTCQX market generally have very limited trading volume and exhibit a widerspread between the bid/ask quotations than stocks traded on national exchanges. Moreover, a significant number of institutionalinvestors have investment policies that prohibit them from trading in stocks on the OTCQX marketplace. As a result, investors mayfind it difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations of the price of, our common stock. This significantly limitsthe liquidity of our common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We do not currently, and are not expectedin the future to, meet the listing standards of any national exchange. We presently anticipate that our common stock will continueto be quoted on the OTCQX market. As a result, investors must bear the economic risk of holding their shares of our common stockfor an indefinite period of time. In the future, our common stock could become subject to “penny stock” rules whichimpose additional disclosure requirements on broker-dealers and could further negatively impact market liquidity for our commonstock and our stockholders’ ability to sell their shares of our common stock. The declaration of dividends is withinthe discretion of our Board of Directors, subject to any applicable limitations under Delaware corporate law. Our ability to paydividends in the future depends on, among other things, our future royalty revenues, which are expected to decrease sharply overthe next several years, as well as our ability to manage expenses, including costs relating to our ongoing operations. In April 2013, we announcedthat our Board of Directors intends to distribute excess cash, expected to arise from ongoing royalty revenues, in the form ofperiodic dividends to our stockholders. On December 5, 2014, our Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $0.10per share, which was paid on January 28, 2015. In addition our Board of Directors declared dividends of $0.50 and $0.25 per shareon July 2, 2015 and December 2, 2015, respectively. Such dividends were paid on August 12, 2015 and December 14, 2015, respectively.On November 14, 2016, our Board of Directors also declared a special cash dividend of $0.15 per share, which was paid on December12, 2016. The declaration of dividends is within the discretion of our Board of Directors, subject to any applicable limitationsunder Delaware corporate law, and therefore our Board of Directors could decide in the future not to declare dividends. In addition,our ability to pay dividends in the future depends on, among other things, our future revenues from existing royalties and ourability to manage expenses, including costs relating to our ongoing operations. Our future revenues from existing royalties areexpected to decrease sharply over the next several years (and eventually cease altogether) due to eventual expirations over timeof our right to receive royalties under the terms of our existing licensing arrangements. Future revenues from existing royaltiesmay also decline due to decreases in the sales of the drug products for which we have the right to receive royalties. There isno assurance that we will have sufficient royalty revenues to be able to pay dividends in the future. Moreover, if we file a Planof Dissolution, the applicable Delaware court may impose limitations on our ability to declare dividends prior to the final dissolutionof the Company. Any inability to pay dividends could cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly.  17   Anti-takeover provisions in our charterdocuments and under Delaware corporate law may make it more difficult to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficialto our stockholders. Provisions of our certificateof incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware corporate law, could make it more difficult for a third party toacquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders. These anti-takeover provisions include:  ·lack    of a provision for cumulative voting in the election of directors; ·the ability of our    board to authorize the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock to increase the number of outstanding shares    and thwart a takeover attempt; ·advance notice requirements    for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at    stockholder meetings; and ·limitations on who    may call a special meeting of stockholders. Further, we have in placea Section 382 rights plan, commonly known as a “poison pill”, that our Board of Directors adopted in April 2014 inan effort to preserve the value of our net operating loss carryforwards. The provisions described above, our Section 382 rightsplan and provisions of Delaware corporate law relating to business combinations with interested stockholdersmay discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us. These provisions may also discourage, delay or prevent a thirdparty from acquiring a large portion of our securities or initiating a tender offer, even if our stockholders might receive apremium for their shares in the acquisition over the then current market price.   (See Note 15 to our financial statements,included in Item 8, in this document.) The provisions describedabove and provisions of Delaware corporate law relating to business combinations with interested stockholders may discourage,delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us. These provisions may also discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiringa large portion of our securities, or initiating a tender offer, even if our stockholders might receive a premium for their sharesin the acquisition over the then current market price. The issuance of preferred stock may adverselyaffect rights of our common stockholders. Under our certificateof incorporation, our Board of Directors has the authority to issue up to three million shares of “blank check” preferredstock and to determine the price, rights, preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by ourstockholders. The rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to the rights of the holders of any shares of preferredstock that may be issued in the future. In addition to discouraging a takeover, as discussed above, this “blank check”preferred stock may have rights, including economic rights senior to the common stock, and, as a result, the issuance of suchpreferred stock could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock.  18    "
10,ENZN,ENZON PHARMACEUTICALS INC,2016-03-21,"Risk Factors
 Throughout this AnnualReport on Form 10-K, we have made forward-looking statements in an attempt to better enable the reader to understand our futureprospects and make informed judgments. By their nature, forward-looking statements are subject to numerous factors that may influenceoutcomes or even prevent their eventual realization. Such factors may be external to the Company and entirely outside our control. We cannot guaranteethat our assumptions and expectations will be correct. Failure of events to be achieved or of certain underlying assumptions toprove accurate could cause actual results to vary materially from past results and those anticipated or projected. We do not intendto update forward-looking statements. Certain risks and uncertaintiesare discussed below. However, it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Accordingly, you should not considerthis recitation to be complete. 12   Risks Relating tothe Proposed Dissolution and Liquidation The proposed dissolution and liquidationof the Company may not be completed in a timely manner or at all. On February4, 2016, our Board of Directors adopted a Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution, pursuant to which the Company would, subject to obtaining requisite stockholder approval, be liquidatedand dissolved in accordance with Sections 280 and 281(a) of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. Inapproving the Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution, our Board of Directors had considered, among other factors, the ability of the Companyto obtain no-action relief from the SEC to suspend certain of the Company’s reporting obligations under the SecuritiesExchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the anticipated cost savings if such relief is granted by the SEC. Upon further review,the Company does not currently believe that the SEC is likely to grant such relief to the Company this year. Accordingly,after further consideration, our Board of Directors has determined that it would be fair, advisable and in the best interests of theCompany and its stockholders to postpone seeking stockholder approval of the Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution until alater time to be determined by our Board of Directors. The amount we distribute to our stockholdersas liquidating distributions, if any, pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution may be substantially less than estimated. At present, we cannotdetermine with certainty the amount of any liquidating distribution to our stockholders if the Plan of Liquidation and Dissolutionis implemented. The amount of cash ultimately distributed to our stockholders in any liquidating distribution pursuant to the Planof Liquidation and Dissolution depends on, among other things, the amount of our liabilities, obligations and expenses and claimsagainst us, and the amount of the reserves that we establish during the liquidation process. Estimates of these amounts may beinaccurate. Factors that could impact these estimates include the following: (i) if any of the estimates regarding the Plan ofLiquidation and Dissolution, including the expenses to satisfy outstanding obligations, liabilities and claims during the liquidationprocess, are inaccurate, (ii) if litigation is brought against us or our directors and officers, if unforeseen claims are assertedagainst us, we will have to defend or resolve such claims or establish a reasonable reserve before making distributions to ourstockholders, (iii) if the estimates regarding the expenses to be incurred in the liquidation process, including expenses of personnelrequired and other operating expenses (including legal, accounting and other professional fees) necessary to dissolve and liquidatethe Company, are inaccurate and (iv) if we continue to incur significant expenses related to ongoing reporting obligations. Risks Relating to the Company and itsOperations  We derive most of our royalty revenuesfrom continued sales of PegIntron, which have been in decline since 2008, and if sales of PegIntron continue to decline or salesof other drug products for which we receive royalty revenues materially decline, our results of operations and financial positioncould be materially harmed. We derive most of ourroyalty revenues from continued sales of PegIntron, which is marketed by Merck.   Royalty revenues from sales of PegIntronaccounted for approximately 80% of our total royalty revenues in each of the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014. Sales of PegIntronhave been in decline since 2008. As a consequence, a continued decline in the sales of PegIntron could adversely affect our operatingresults and financial position. Merck reported that its worldwide sales of PegIntron declined 52% to $182 million in 2015 comparedwith to $381 million in 2014, driven by lower volumes in most regions as the availability of new therapeutic options has resultedin loss of market share or led to patient treatment delays in markets anticipating the availability of new therapeutic options.We cannot assure you that Merck will continue to generate sales of PegIntron at levels that would enable us to receive royaltiesin amounts that are comparable with the amounts of royalties that we have received in recent years. The amount and timing of resourcesdedicated by Merck to the marketing of PegIntron is not within our control. Our royalty revenues will be negatively affected ifsales of PegIntron are limited for any reason, including if Merck cannot market PegIntron effectively as a result of competitive,manufacturing, regulatory or other issues. 13   Products that competewith PegIntron have been and potentially will be introduced by other drug manufacturers. Hoffmann-La Roche’s PEGASYS, a competingPEGylated interferon alfa, has resulted in significant competitive pressure on PegIntron sales in the U.S. and all internationalmarkets. PEGASYS has taken market share away from PegIntron and the overall market for PEGylated alpha-interferon for the treatmentof hepatitis C has been contracting. As a result, sales of PegIntron in certain markets where it competes with PEGASYS and theroyalties we receive on those sales have declined. We cannot assure you that PEGASYS will not continue to gain market share atthe expense of PegIntron which could result in lower PegIntron sales and lower royalties to us. On December 6, 2013,the FDA approved Gilead’s Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) 400 mg tablets, a once-daily oral nucleotide analog polymerase inhibitor forthe treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection as a component of a combination antiviral treatment regimen. Sovaldi was approvedin combination with peg-interferon alpha and ribavirin for genotype 1 and 4 patients, and in combination with ribavirin for genotype2 and 3 patients. On January 17, 2014, the European Commission granted marketing authorization for Sovaldi. On October 10, 2014,the FDA approved Gilead’s Harvoni (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir), the first once-daily single tablet regimen for the treatment ofgenotype 1 chronic hepatitis C infection, eliminating the need for interferon and ribavirin. On November 18, 2014, the EuropeanCommission granted marketing authorization for Harvoni. On December 19, 2014, the FDA approved Abbvie’s all-oral treatmentfor hepatitis C, and on January 16, 2015, the European Commission granted marketing authorization for this treatment. The adoptionof Sovaldi and other oral treatments for hepatitis C has had a negative impact on PegIntron revenues and we expect continued declinesin PegIntron revenues. There are several novel agents in various stages of preclinical and clinical development for the treatmentof hepatitis C, which either include or eliminate combination with pegylated interferon-based therapies. It is possible that thisresearch could lead to other competing products. We may not receive an Immunity Fee fromNektar for the sale of certain products InJune 2015, we delivered notice to Nektar that it had breached our Cross-License and Option Agreement with us by failing to payan immunity fee that we believe is due and payable under the Agreement. On August 14, 2015, we filed a summons and complaint againstNektar in the Supreme Court of the State of New York for breach of contract. On October 23, 2015, Nektar filed a motion to dismissthe complaint. On February 2, 2016, the Court granted Nektar’s motion to dismiss the complaint. We currently intendto appeal this dismissal. While we believe that an immunity fee is currently due and payable by Nektarand we intend to continue to pursue this claim, the outcome of such dispute is uncertain and there can be no assurance that wewill be able to collect, in full or in part, the immunity fee or any future payments related thereto from Nektar.  We may not be able to sustain profitabilityand we may incur losses over the next several years. We have incurred lossesin the past and have limited sources of revenues. Our revenues and operating results will likely fluctuate in future periods dueto variations in our royalty revenues, which are expected to decline rapidly. We expect to continue to incur operating expenses. Our rights to receive royalties on salesof PegIntron and sales of other drug products will eventually expire and we currently do not intend on acquiring new sources ofroyalty revenues. Merck’s obligationto pay us royalties on sales of PegIntron terminates, on a country-by-country basis, upon the later of the date on which the lastpatent to contain a claim covering PegIntron expires in the country or 15 years after the date on which PegIntron was first approvedfor commercial marketing in such country.   Currently, expirations of our right to receive royalties on sales of PegIntronare expected to occur in 2016 in the U.S., 2018 in Europe and 2019 in Japan.   Other than our rights to received immunityfees, our rights to receive royalties under our agreement with Nektar relating to CIMZIA and Macugen expired in 2014 in the U.S.and Great Britain and will expire as late as 2018 in other countries outside the U.S. In addition, our rights to receive royaltieson sales of Oncaspar and Adagen expired in 2014. We currently do not intend to acquire new sources of royalty revenues.  As a result, following expirations of our rights to receive royalties on sales of PegIntron and sales of other drug products, wemay not have sufficient revenues to continue operations. 14   We may not realize our deferred incometax assets. The ultimate realizationof our deferred income tax assets is dependent upon generating future taxable income, executing tax planning strategies, and reversalsof existing taxable temporary differences. We have recorded a valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets. The valuationallowance may fluctuate as conditions change. Our ability to utilize net operating losses (“NOL”) carryforwards tooffset our future taxable income and/or to recover previously paid taxes would be limited if we were to undergo an “ownershipchange” within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “IRC”). In general, an “ownershipchange” occurs whenever the percentage of the stock of a corporation owned by “5-percent shareholders” (withinthe meaning of Section 382 of the IRC) increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the stock of suchcorporation owned by such “5-percent shareholders” at any time over the testing period. An ownership changeunder Section 382 of the IRC would establish an annual limitation to the amount of NOL carryforwards we could utilize to offsetour taxable income in any single year. The application of these limitations might prevent full utilization of the deferred taxassets attributable to our NOL carryforwards. To preserve our ability to utilize NOLs in the future without a Section 382 limitation,our Board of Directors adopted a Section 382 rights plan on April 30, 2014, which would be triggered upon certain transfers ofour securities. There can be no assurance that we will not undergo an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382. See Note16 to our Financial Statements, included in Item 8 in this document.  We have reallocated certain employment responsibilities and outsourced certain corporatefunctions, which make us more dependent on third-parties to perform these corporate functions. We have outsourced certain corporate functions, which make us moredependent on third-parties for the performance of these functions. In addition, this reduction in our workforce has had a negativeimpact on our ability to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and effective disclosure controls and procedures.To the extent that we are unable to effectively reallocate employee responsibilities, retain key officers and employees as consultants,maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and effective disclosure controls and procedures, establish and maintainagreements with competent third-party contractors on terms that are acceptable to us, or effectively manage the work performedby any retained third-party contractors, our ability to manage the operations of our business effectively could be compromised. We may be subject to a variety of typesof product liability or other claims based on allegations that the use of our product candidates by participants in our clinicaltrials has resulted in adverse effects, and our insurance may not cover all product liability or other claims. We may face liabilityclaims related to the use or misuse of our product candidates in previously conducted clinical trials. These claims may be expensiveto defend and may result in large judgments against us. Any such claims against us, regardless of their merit, might result insignificant costs to defend or awards against us, and our insurance coverage and resources may not be sufficient to satisfy anyliability resulting from such claims. A successful product liability or other claim brought against us could cause the market priceof our common stock to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and materially harm ourbusiness, financial condition or results of operations. 15   We depend on patents and proprietaryrights, which may offer only limited protection against potential infringement and the development of competing products. The pharmaceuticalindustry places considerable importance on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for new technologies, products and processes.If we are unable to obtain and enforce patent protection for our product candidates or to maintain the confidentiality of our tradesecrets, the value of our intellectual property portfolio could be harmed. We have an extensive portfolio of issued U.S. patentsand filed applications, many of which have foreign counterparts. Although we believe that our patents provide certain protectionfrom competition, such patents may not provide substantial protection or commercial benefit to us, or afford us adequate protectionfrom competing products, and may be challenged or declared invalid. In addition, U.S. patents or foreign patent equivalents maynot be issued to us in the future. Issued patents maybe challenged, invalidated or circumvented. In addition, court decisions may introduce uncertainty as to the enforceability orscope of patents owned by biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including us. The legal systems of certain countries do notfavor the aggressive enforcement of patents, and the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent asthe laws of the U.S. Therefore, enforceability or scope of our patents in the U.S. or in foreign countries cannot be predictedwith certainty, and, as a result, any patents that we own or license may not provide sufficient protection against competitors.In addition, we may not be able to obtain or maintain a patent from our pending patent applications, those we may file in the future,or those we may license from third parties. We believe that ourpatent rights are enforceable. However, those rights may prove unenforceable or invalid, or will expire. If we are not able toprotect our patent positions, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, which could adverselyaffect the market value of our common stock. We may become aware that certain organizations are engaging in activities that infringecertain of our patents. We may be unable to enforce our patents and other rights against such organizations. Legal or administrativeproceedings may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend against claims of infringement. We have inthe past been involved in patent litigation and other proceedings and we may likely become involved in additional patent litigationor proceedings in the future. If we become involved in any such litigation or proceeding, irrespective of the outcome, we may incursubstantial costs, the efforts of our technical and management personnel may be diverted, and such disputes could substantiallydelay or prevent our product development or commercialization activities, which could materially harm our business, financial conditionand results of operations. We are party to license and other collaboration agreementsthat contain complex commercial terms that could result in disputes, litigation or indemnification liability that could cause thevalue of the Company and our assets and the market price of our common stock to decline. We are party to license, collaborationand other agreements with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. These agreements contain complex commercial terms, includingroyalties on drug sales based on a number of complex variables (including net sales calculations, geography, scope of patent claimcoverage, patent life and other factors) and indemnification obligations. From time to time, we may have dispute resolution discussionswith third parties regarding the appropriate interpretation of the complex commercial terms contained in our agreements. One ormore disputes may arise or escalate in the future regarding our agreements that may ultimately result in costly litigation andunfavorable interpretation of contract terms, which could cause the value of the Company and our assets and the market price ofour common stock to decline. 16   We are party to license agreements whereby we may receiveroyalties from products subject to regulatory approval. Our licensees may beunable to maintain regulatory approvals for currently licensed products or obtain regulatory approvals for new products. Safetyissues could also result in the failure to maintain regulatory approvals or decrease revenues. Risks Relating to Our Common Stock  The price of our common stock has been,and may continue to be, volatile. Historically, the marketprice of our common stock has fluctuated over a wide range, and it is likely that the price of our common stock will continue tobe volatile in the future. The market price of our common stock could be impacted due to a variety of factors, including, in additionto global and industry-wide events:  ·the level of revenues we generate from royalties we receive; ·changes in our business strategy; ·the losses we may incur; ·developments in patent or other proprietary rights owned or licensed by us, our collaborative partners or our competitors; ·public concern as to the safety and efficacy of products developed by us or others; and ·litigation. In addition, due toone or more of the foregoing factors in one or more future quarters, our results of operations may fall below the expectationsof securities analysts and investors. In that event, the market price of our common stock could materially decline. The declaration of dividends is withinthe discretion of our Board of Directors, subject to any applicable limitations under Delaware corporate law. Our ability to paydividends in the future depends on, among other things, our future royalty revenues, which are expected to decrease sharply overthe next several years, as well as our ability to manage expenses, including costs relating to our ongoing operations. In April 2013, weannounced that our Board of Directors intends to distribute excess cash, expected to arise from ongoing royalty revenues, inthe form of periodic dividends to our stockholders. In June and December 2013, respectively, the Company paid specialdividends of $1.60 and $0.45 per share. On December 5, 2014, our Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $0.10per share, which was paid on January 28, 2015. In addition our Board of Directors declared dividends of $0.50 and $0.25 pershare on July 2, 2015 and December 2, 2015, respectively. Such dividends were paid on August 12, 2015 and December 14, 2015,respectively. The declaration of dividends is within the discretion of our Board of Directors, subject to anyapplicable limitations under Delaware corporate law, and therefore our Board of Directors could decide in the future not todeclare dividends. In addition, our ability to pay dividends in the future depends on, among other things, our futurerevenues from existing royalties and our ability to manage expenses, including costs relating to our ongoing operations. Ourfuture revenues from existing royalties are expected to decrease sharply over the next several years (and eventually ceasealtogether) due to eventual expirations over time of our right to receive royalties under the terms of our existing licensingarrangements. Future revenues from existing royalties may also decline due to decreases in the sales of the drug products forwhich we have the right to receive royalties. There is no assurance that we will have sufficient royalty revenues to be ableto pay dividends in the future. Moreover, if we file a Plan of Dissolution, the applicable Delaware court may imposelimitations on our ability to declare dividends prior to the final dissolution of the Company. Any inability to pay dividendscould cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly 17   Events with respect to our capital stock could cause thenumber of shares of our common stock outstanding to increase and thereby cause our stockholders to suffer significant dilution. Sales of substantialamounts of our common stock in the open market, or the availability of such shares for sale, could adversely affect the marketprice of our common stock. As of December 31, 2015, we had 44,214,603 shares of common stock outstanding. As of that date, thefollowing securities that may be exercised for, or are convertible into, shares of our common stock were outstanding:   ·Options. Stock options to purchase 0.5 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of approximately $3.65 per share. ·Restricted stock units. Approximately 45,000 shares of our common stock are issuable in respect of outstanding restricted stock units held by officers, employees and directors. The shares of our commonstock issuable upon the exercise of options and the settlement of restricted stock are currently registered under the SecuritiesAct of 1933, as amended, and, therefore, once those shares of common stock are issued, they may be eligible for public resale.As a result, if a large number of shares of our common stock are sold into the public market, or if there is an expectation ofsuch sales, these sales or expectations of these sales could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Anti-takeover provisions in our charterdocuments and under Delaware corporate law may make it more difficult to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficialto our stockholders. Provisions of our certificateof incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware corporate law, could make it more difficult for a third party toacquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders. These anti-takeover provisions include:  ·lack of a provision for cumulative voting in the election ofdirectors; ·the ability of our board to authorize the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt; ·advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and ·limitations on who may call a special meeting of stockholders. Further, we have inplace a Section 382 rights plan, commonly known as a “poison pill”, that our Board of Directors adopted in April 2014in an effort to preserve the value of our net operating loss carryforwards. The provisions described above, our Section 382 rightsplan and provisions of Delaware corporate law relating to business combinations with interested stockholdersmay discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us. These provisions may also discourage, delay or prevent a thirdparty from acquiring a large portion of our securities, or initiating a tender offer, even if our stockholders might receive apremium for their shares in the acquisition over the then current market price.  (See Note 16 to our financial statements,included in Item 8, in this document.) The provisions describedabove and provisions of Delaware corporate law relating to business combinations with interested stockholders may discourage, delayor prevent a third party from acquiring us. These provisions may also discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiringa large portion of our securities, or initiating a tender offer, even if our stockholders might receive a premium for their sharesin the acquisition over the then current market price.  18   The issuance of preferred stock may adversely affect rightsof our common stockholders. Under our certificateof incorporation, our board of directors has the authority to issue up to three million shares of “blank check” preferredstock and to determine the price, rights, preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by ourstockholders. The rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to the rights of the holders of any shares of preferredstock that may be issued in the future. In addition to discouraging a takeover, as discussed above, this “blank check”preferred stock may have rights, including economic rights senior to the common stock, and, as a result, the issuance of such preferredstock could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock.  A small number of stockholders own alarge percentage of our common stock and can influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval. A small number of ourstockholders own a large percentage of our common stock and can therefore influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholdersfor approval. Based on information known to us as of the date of this report, our four largest stockholders collectively control approximately32.7% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders collectively have the ability to influence the outcomeof matters submitted to our stockholders for approval. These stockholders may support proposals and actions with which you maydisagree. The concentration of ownership could also delay or prevent a change in control of the Company or otherwise discouragea potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of the Company, which in turn could cause the market price of our commonstock to decline.  If we are unable to satisfy the continuedlisting requirements of The NASDAQ Stock Market, our common stock could be delisted and the price and liquidity of our common stockmay be adversely affected. Our common stock may lose value and ourcommon stock could be delisted from NASDAQ due to several factors or a combination of such factors. While our common stock is currentlylisted on The NASDAQ Stock Market, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain such listing. To maintain the listingof our common stock on The NASDAQ Stock Market, we are required to meet certain listing requirements, including, among others,a requirement to maintain a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share. If our common stock trades below the $1.00 minimum closingbid price requirement for 30 consecutive business days or if we do not meet other listing requirements, we may be notified by NASDAQof non-compliance. On November 11, 2015, we received a notice from Nasdaq, indicating that, based upon the closing bid price ofour common stock for the last 30 consecutive business days, we no longer meet the requirement to maintain a minimum bid price of$1 per share, as set forth in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) (the “Notice”). In accordancewith Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), we have beenprovided a period of 180 calendar days, or until May 9, 2016, in which to regain compliance. In order to regain compliance withthe minimum bid price requirement, the closing bid price of our common stock must be at least $1 per share for a minimum of tenconsecutive business days during this 180-day period. In the event that we do not regain compliance within this 180-day period,we may be eligible to seek an additional compliance period of 180 calendar days if we meet the continued listing requirement formarket value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for the Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exceptionof the bid price requirement, and provide written notice to Nasdaq of our intent to cure the deficiency during this second complianceperiod, by effecting a reverse stock split, if necessary. However, if it appears to the Nasdaq Staff that we will not be able tocure the deficiency, or if we are otherwise not eligible, Nasdaq will provide notice to us that our common stock will be subjectto delisting. 19   TheNotice does not result in the immediate delisting of the Company’s common stock from the Nasdaq Capital Market. The Companyintends to monitor the closing bid price of the Company’s common stock and consider its available options in the event thatthe closing bid price of the Company’s common stock remains below $1 per share. There can be no assurance that the Companywill be able to regain compliance with the minimum bidprice requirement or maintain compliance with the other listing requirements. As of the date of this report we have not regainedcompliance. There can be no assurance that we would pursuea reverse stock split or be able to obtain the approvals necessary to effect a reverse stock split. In addition, there can be noassurance that, following any reverse stock split, the per share trading price of our common stock would remain above $1.00 pershare or that we would be able to continue to meet other listing requirements. If our common stock is delisted, market liquidityfor our common stock could be severely affected and our stockholders’ ability to sell their shares of our common stock couldbe limited. In addition, our common stock could be subject to “penny stock” rules which impose additional disclosurerequirements on broker-dealers and could further negatively impact our market liquidity for our common stock and our stockholders’ability to sell their shares of our common stock. Accordingly, a delisting of our common stock from NASDAQ would negatively affectthe value of our common stock. Delisting could also have other negative results, including, but not limited to, the loss of institutionalinvestor interest.  "
17,ENZN,ENZON PHARMACEUTICALS INC,2015-03-05,"Risk Factors
 Throughout this AnnualReport on Form 10-K, we have made forward-looking statements in an attempt to better enable the reader to understand our futureprospects and make informed judgments. By their nature, forward-looking statements are subject to numerous factors that may influenceoutcomes or even prevent their eventual realization. Such factors may be external to the Company and entirely outside our control. We cannot guaranteethat our assumptions and expectations will be correct. Failure of events to be achieved or of certain underlying assumptions toprove accurate could cause actual results to vary materially from past results and those anticipated or projected. We do not intendto update forward-looking statements. Certain risks and uncertaintiesare discussed below. However, it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Accordingly, you should not considerthis recitation to be complete. 14  Risks Relating to the Company and itsOperations Our Board of Directors may decide inthe future to pursue a dissolution and liquidation of the Company. In December 2012, weannounced a review of the possible sale or disposition of one or more corporate assets or a sale of our company. In April 2013,our sale review process concluded and did not result in a definitive offer to acquire our company or all or substantially all ofour company’s assets. Our Board of Directors could decide in the future that a dissolution and liquidation of the Companywould be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. If our Board of Directors were to approve and recommend, andour stockholders were to approve, a dissolution and liquidation of the Company, we would be required under Delaware corporate lawto pay our outstanding obligations, as well as to make reasonable provision for contingent and unknown obligations, prior to makingany distributions in liquidation to our stockholders. Our commitments and contingent liabilities may include (i) various claimsand legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business and (ii) non-cancelable lease obligations. As a result of this requirement,a portion of our assets may need to be reserved pending the resolution of such obligations. In addition, we may be subject to litigationor other claims related to a dissolution and liquidation of the Company. If a dissolution and liquidation were pursued, our Boardof Directors, in consultation with its advisors, would need to evaluate these matters and make a determination about a reasonableamount to reserve. Accordingly, if a dissolution and liquidation were pursued, we cannot be certain of the amount and/or timingof any distributions to our stockholders. In addition, if a dissolution and liquidation were pursued, our common stock would ceaseto trade on the effective date of the filing of the certificate of dissolution and we would close our stock transfer books anddiscontinue recording transfers of our common stock at that time. Accordingly, if a dissolution and liquidation were pursued, theprice and liquidity of our common stock may be adversely affected. We derive most of our royalty revenuesfrom continued sales of PegIntron, which have been in decline since 2008, and if sales of PegIntron continue to decline or salesof other drug products for which we receive royalty revenues materially decline, our results of operations and financial positioncould be materially harmed. We derive most ofour royalty revenues from continued sales of PegIntron, which is marketed by Merck.   Royalty revenues from salesof PegIntron accounted for approximately 79% and 87% of our total royalty revenues in 2014 and 2013, respectively. Salesof PegIntron have been in decline since 2008. As a consequence, a continued decline in the sales of PegIntron couldadversely affect our operating results and financial position. Merck reported that its worldwide sales of PegIntron declined23% to $381 million in 2014 compared with 2013, driven by lower volumes in most regions as the availability of newtherapeutic options has resulted in loss of market share or led to patient treatment delays in markets anticipating theavailability of new therapeutic options. We cannot assure you that Merck will continue to generate sales of PegIntron atlevels that would enable us to receive royalties in amounts that are comparable with the amounts of royalties that we havereceived in recent years. The amount and timing of resources dedicated by Merck to the marketing of PegIntron is not withinour control. Our royalty revenues will be negatively affected if sales of PegIntron are limited for any reason, including ifMerck cannot market PegIntron effectively as a result of competitive, manufacturing, regulatory or other issues. 15  Products that competewith PegIntron have been and potentially will be introduced by other drug manufacturers. Hoffmann-La Roche’s PEGASYS, a competingPEGylated interferon alfa, has resulted in significant competitive pressure on PegIntron sales in the U.S. and all internationalmarkets. PEGASYS has taken market share away from PegIntron and the overall market for PEGylated alpha-interferon for the treatmentof hepatitis C has been contracting. As a result, sales of PegIntron in certain markets where it competes with PEGASYS and theroyalties we receive on those sales have declined. We cannot assure you that PEGASYS will not continue to gain market share atthe expense of PegIntron which could result in lower PegIntron sales and lower royalties to us. On December 6, 2013,the FDA approved Gilead’s Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) 400 mg tablets, a once-daily oral nucleotide analog polymerase inhibitor forthe treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection as a component of a combination antiviral treatment regimen. Sovaldi was approvedin combination with peg-interferon alpha and ribavirin for genotype 1 and 4 patients, and in combination with ribavirin for genotype2 and 3 patients. On January 17, 2014, the European Commission granted marketing authorization for Sovaldi. On October 10, 2014,the FDA approved Gilead’s Harvoni (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir), the first once-daily single tablet regimen for the treatment ofgeotype 1 chronic hepatitis C infection, eliminating the need for interferon and ribavirin. On November 18, 2014, the EuropeanCommission granted marketing authorization for Harvoni. On December 19, 2014, the FDA approved Abbvie’s all-oral treatmentfor hepatitis C, and on January 16, 2015, the European Commission granted marketing authorization for this treatment. We expectthat the adoption of oral treatments for hepatitis C will have a negative impact on PegIntron revenues. There are several novelagents in various stages of preclinical and clinical development for the treatment of hepatitis C, which either include or eliminatecombination with pegylated interferon-based therapies. It is possible that this research could lead to other competing products. We may not be able to sustain profitabilityand we may incur losses over the next several years. We have incurred lossesin the past and have limited sources of revenues. Our revenues and operating results will likely fluctuate in future periods dueto variations in our royalty revenues. We expect to continue to incur operating expenses and anticipate that we could have significantexpenses in the foreseeable future. In addition, if our Board of Directors decides in the future to pursue a dissolution and liquidationof the Company, the implementation of any transaction that might result from any such dissolution or liquidation process, whichcould further reduce our existing capital, including legal and financial advisor fees or related actions could involve incurringmaterial expenses. Our rights to receive royalties on salesof PegIntron and sales of other drug products will eventually expire and we currently do not intend on acquiring new sources ofroyalty revenues. Merck’sobligation to pay us royalties on sales of PegIntron terminates, on a country-by-country basis, upon the later of the dateon which the last patent to contain a claim covering PegIntron expires in the country or 15 years after the date onwhich PegIntron was first approved for commercial marketing in such country.   Currently, expirations of our right toreceive royalties on sales of PegIntron are expected to occur in 2016 in the U.S., 2018 in Europe and 2019 in Japan.  Our rights to receive royalties under our agreement with Nektar relating to CIMZIA and Macugen expired in 2014 in the U.S.and Great Britain and will expire as late as 2018 in other countries outside the U.S. In addition, our rights to receiveroyalties on sales of Oncaspar and Adagen expired in 2014. We currently do not intend on acquiring new sources of royaltyrevenues.   As a result, following expirations of our rights to receive royalties on sales of PegIntron and sales ofother drug products, we may not have sufficient revenues to continue operations.  We may notrealize our deferred income tax assets. The ultimate realizationof our deferred income tax assets is dependent upon generating future taxable income, executing tax planning strategies, and reversalsof existing taxable temporary differences. We have recorded a valuation allowance against our deferred income tax assets. The valuationallowance may fluctuate as conditions change. Our ability to utilize net operating losses (“NOL”) carryforwards tooffset our future taxable income and/or to recover previously paid taxes would be limited if we were to undergo an “ownershipchange” within the meaning of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “IRC”). In general, an “ownershipchange” occurs whenever the percentage of the stock of a corporation owned by “5-percent shareholders” (withinthe meaning of Section 382 of the IRC) increases by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of the stock of suchcorporation owned by such “5-percent shareholders” at any time over the testing period. An ownership changeunder Section 382 of the IRC would establish an annual limitation to the amount of NOL carryforwards we could utilize to offsetour taxable income in any single year. The application of these limitations might prevent full utilization of the deferred taxassets attributable to our NOL carryforwards. To preserve our ability to utilize NOLs in the future without a Section 382 limitation,we adopted a shareholder rights plan on May 1, 2014, which would be triggered upon certain transfers of our securities. Therecan be no assurance that we will not undergo an ownership change within the meaning of Section 382..   As a result of the reduction in ourworkforce that was completed in 2013, we have reallocated certain employment responsibilities and outsourced certain corporatefunctions, which make us more dependent on third-parties to perform these corporate functions. As a result of thereduction in our workforce that was completed in 2013, we have outsourced certain corporate functions, which make us moredependent on third-parties for the performance of these functions. In addition, this reduction in our workforce has had a negativeimpact on our ability to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and effective disclosure controls and procedures.To the extent that we are unable to effectively reallocate employee responsibilities, retain key employees as consultants, maintaineffective internal control over financial reporting and effective disclosure controls and procedures, establish and maintain agreementswith competent third-party contractors on terms that are acceptable to us, or effectively manage the work performed by any retainedthird-party contractors, our ability to manage the operations of our business effectively could be compromised. 16   We may be subject to a variety of typesof product liability or other claims based on allegations that the use of our product candidates by participants in our clinicaltrials has resulted in adverse effects, and our insurance may not cover all product liability or other claims. We may face liabilityclaims related to the use or misuse of our product candidates in previously conducted clinical trials. These claims may be expensiveto defend and may result in large judgments against us. Any such claims against us, regardless of their merit, might result insignificant costs to defend or awards against us, and our insurance coverage and resources may not be sufficient to satisfy anyliability resulting from such claims. A successful product liability or other claim brought against us could cause the market priceof our common stock to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and materially harm ourbusiness, financial condition or results of operations. We depend on patents and proprietaryrights, which may offer only limited protection against potential infringement and the development of competing products. The pharmaceuticalindustry places considerable importance on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for new technologies, products and processes.If we are unable to obtain and enforce patent protection for our product candidates or to maintain the confidentiality of our tradesecrets, the value of our intellectual property portfolio could be harmed. We have an extensive portfolio of issued U.S. patentsand filed applications, many of which have foreign counterparts. Although we believe that our patents provide certain protectionfrom competition, such patents may not provide substantial protection or commercial benefit to us, or afford us adequate protectionfrom competing products, and may be challenged or declared invalid. In addition, U.S. patents or foreign patent equivalents maynot be issued to us in the future. Issued patents maybe challenged, invalidated or circumvented. In addition, court decisions may introduce uncertainty as to the enforceability orscope of patents owned by biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including us. The legal systems of certain countries do notfavor the aggressive enforcement of patents, and the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent asthe laws of the U.S. Therefore, enforceability or scope of our patents in the U.S. or in foreign countries cannot be predictedwith certainty, and, as a result, any patents that we own or license may not provide sufficient protection against competitors.In addition, we may not be able to obtain or maintain a patent from our pending patent applications, those we may file in the future,or those we may license from third parties. We believe that ourpatent rights are enforceable. However, those rights may prove unenforceable or invalid, or will expire. If we are not able toprotect our patent positions, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, which could adverselyaffect the market value of our common stock. We may become aware that certain organizations are engaging in activities that infringecertain of our patents.

Safetyissues could also result in the failure to maintain regulatory approvals or decrease revenues. Risks Relating to Our Common Stock The price of our common stock has been,and may continue to be, volatile. Historically, the marketprice of our common stock has fluctuated over a wide range, and it is likely that the price of our common stock will continue tobe volatile in the future. The market price of our common stock could be impacted due to a variety of factors, including, in additionto global and industry-wide events: ·the level of revenues we generate from royalties we receive;·changes in our business strategy;·the losses we may incur;·developments in patent or other proprietary rights owned or licensed by us, our collaborative partnersor our competitors;·public concern as to the safety and efficacy of products developed by us or others; and·litigation. In addition, due toone or more of the foregoing factors in one or more future quarters, our results of operations may fall below the expectationsof securities analysts and investors. In that event, the market price of our common stock could materially decline. The declaration of dividends is withinthe discretion of our Board of Directors, subject to any applicable limitations under Delaware corporate law. Our ability to paydividends in the future depends on, among other things, our future royalty revenues, which are expected to decrease over time,as well as our ability to manage expenses, including costs relating to our ongoing operations. In April 2013, we announcedthat our Board of Directors intends to distribute excess cash, expected to arise from ongoing royalty revenues, in the form ofperiodic dividends to our stockholders. In June and December 2013, respectively, the Company paid special dividends of $1.60 and$0.45 per share. On December 5, 2014, our Board of Directors declared a special cash dividend of $0.10 per share, ,which was paidon January 28, 2015. The declaration of dividends is within the discretion of our Board of Directors, subject to any applicablelimitations under Delaware corporate law, and therefore our Board of Directors could decide in the future not to declare dividends.In addition, our ability to pay dividends in the future depends on, among other things, our future revenues from existing royaltiesand our ability to manage expenses, including costs relating to our ongoing operations. Our future revenues from existing royaltiesare expected to decrease over time (and eventually cease altogether) due to eventual expirations over time of our right to receiveroyalties under the terms of our existing licensing arrangements. Future revenues from existing royalties may also decline dueto decreases in the sales of the drug products for which we have the right to receive royalties. There is no assurance that wewill have sufficient royalty revenues to be able to pay dividends in the future. Any inability to pay dividends could cause themarket price of our common stock to decline significantly Events with respect to our capital stock could cause thenumber of shares of our common stock outstanding to increase and thereby cause our stockholders to suffer significant dilution. Sales of substantialamounts of our common stock in the open market, or the availability of such shares for sale, could adversely affect the marketprice of our common stock. As of December 31, 2014, we had 44,174,456 shares of common stock outstanding. As of that date, thefollowing securities that may be exercised for, or are convertible into, shares of our common stock were outstanding: 18   ·Options. Stock options to purchase 0.5 million shares of our common stock at a weighted averageexercise price of approximately $4.08 per share.·Restricted stock units. Approximately 45,000 shares of our common stock are issuable in respectof outstanding restricted stock units held by officers, employees and directors. The shares of our commonstock issuable upon the exercise of options and the settlement of restricted stock are currently registered under the SecuritiesAct of 1933, as amended, and, therefore, once those shares of common stock are issued, they may be eligible for public resale.As a result, if a large number of shares of our common stock are sold into the public market, or if there is an expectation ofsuch sales, these sales or expectations of these sales could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Anti-takeover provisions in our charterdocuments and under Delaware corporate law may make it more difficult to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficialto our stockholders. Provisions of our certificateof incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware corporate law, could make it more difficult for a third party toacquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders. These anti-takeover provisions include: ·lack of a provision for cumulative voting in the election of directors;·the ability of our board to authorize the issuance of “blank check” preferred stockto increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;·advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposingmatters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and·limitations on who may call a special meeting of stockholders. Further, we have inplace a stockholder rights plan, commonly known as a “poison pill”, that our board of directors adopted in May 2014in an effort to preserve the value of our net operating loss carryforwards. The provisions described above, our stockholder rightsplan and provisions  of Delaware corporate law relating to business combinations with interestedstockholders may discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us. These provisions may also discourage, delay orprevent a third party from acquiring a large portion of our securities, or initiating a tender offer, even if our stockholdersmight receive a premium for their shares in the acquisition over the then current market price. We also have agreements with ourexecutive officers that provide for change of control severance benefits which provides for cash severance, restricted stock,restricted stock units and option award vesting acceleration and other benefits in the event our employees are terminated (or,in some cases, resign for specified reasons) following an acquisition or other change in control. These agreements could discouragea third party from acquiring us.  The provisions describedabove and provisions of Delaware corporate law relating to business combinations with interested stockholders may discourage, delayor prevent a third party from acquiring us.

These agreements could discourage a third party from acquiring us. The issuance of preferred stock may adversely affect rightsof our common stockholders. Under our certificateof incorporation, our board of directors has the authority to issue up to three million shares of “blank check” preferredstock and to determine the price, rights, preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by ourstockholders. The rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to the rights of the holders of any shares of preferredstock that may be issued in the future. In addition to discouraging a takeover, as discussed above, this “blank check”preferred stock may have rights, including economic rights senior to the common stock, and, as a result, the issuance of suchpreferred stock could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock.  19  A small number of stockholders own alarge percentage of our common stock and can influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval. A small number of ourstockholders own a large percentage of our common stock and can therefore influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholdersfor approval. Based on information known to us as of the date of this report, our four largest stockholders collectively control approximately33.9% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders collectively have the ability to influence the outcomeof matters submitted to our stockholders for approval. These stockholders may support proposals and actions with which you maydisagree. The concentration of ownership could also delay or prevent a change in control of the Company or otherwise discouragea potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of the Company, which in turn could cause the market price of our commonstock to decline. If we are unable to satisfy the continuedlisting requirements of The NASDAQ Stock Market, our common stock could be delisted and the price and liquidity of our common stockmay be adversely affected. Our common stock maylose value and our common stock could be delisted from NASDAQ due to several factors or a combination of such factors. While ourcommon stock is currently listed on The NASDAQ Stock Market, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain such listing.To maintain the listing of our common stock on The NASDAQ Stock Market, we are required to meet certain listing requirements,including, among others, a requirement to maintain a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share. If our common stock tradesbelow the $1.00 minimum closing bid price requirement for 30 consecutive business days or if we do not meet other listing requirements,we may be notified by NASDAQ of non-compliance. In July 2014, we received notice from NASDAQ that our common stock price failedto meet the minimum closing bid price requirement for 30 consecutive business day and that, as such, the Company faced the prospectof being delisted. In July 2014, however, the Company regained its compliance with the minimum closing bid price requirement.Our common stock has recently been fluctuating at or below $1.00 per share. In addition, the payment of future dividends, if any,to our stockholders, together with eventual expirations over time of our right to receive royalties under the terms of our existinglicensing arrangements, would be expected to result in a reduction over time in the per-share trading price of our common stock.If the price per share of our common stock were to fall below NASDAQ listing standards, our common stock may be delisted. If weare notified by NASDAQ of non-compliance with the $1.00 minimum closing bid price requirement, we would regain compliance if ourcommon stock trades above $1.00 per share for ten consecutive business days during the 180 days following notice of non-compliance.To increase the per share trading price of our common stock, we may decide to seek to implement a reverse stock split. However,there can be no assurance that we would pursue a reverse stock split or be able to obtain the approvals necessary to effect areverse stock split. In addition, there can be no assurance that, following any reverse stock split, the per share trading priceof our common stock would remain above $1.00 per share or that we would be able to continue to meet other listing requirements.If our common stock is delisted, market liquidity for our common stock could be severely affected and our stockholders’ability to sell their shares of our common stock could be limited. In addition, our common stock could be subject to “pennystock” rules which impose additional disclosure requirements on broker-dealers and could further negatively impact our marketliquidity for our common stock and our stockholders’ ability to sell their shares of our common stock. Accordingly, a delistingof our common stock from NASDAQ would negatively affect the value of our common stock. Delisting could also have other negativeresults, including, but not limited to, the loss of institutional investor interest.  20  "

   Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have made forward-looking statements in an attempt to better enable the reader to understand our future prospects and make informed judgments. By their nature, forward-looking statements are subject to numerous factors that may influence outcomes or even prevent their eventual realization. Such factors may be external to the Company and entirely outside our control. We cannot guarantee that our assumptions and expectations will be correct. Failure of events to be achieved or of certain underlying assumptions to prove accurate could cause actual results to vary materially from past results and those anticipated or projected. We do not intend to update forward-looking statements. Certain risks and uncertainties are discussed below. However, it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Accordingly, you should not consider this recitation to be complete. Risks Relating to the Company and its Operations   14  Our Board of Directors may decide in the future to pursue a dissolution and liquidation of the Company. As previously announced in April 2013, our sale review process did not result in the sale of the Company. Our Board of Directors could decide in the future that a dissolution and liquidation of the Company would be in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. If our Board of Directors were to approve and recommend, and our stockholders were to approve, a dissolution and liquidation of the Company, we would be required under Delaware corporate law to pay our outstanding obligations, as well as to make reasonable provision for contingent and unknown obligations, prior to making any distributions in liquidation to our stockholders. Our commitments and contingent liabilities may include (i) various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business and (ii) non-cancelable lease obligations. As a result of this requirement, a portion of our assets may need to be reserved pending the resolution of such obligations. In addition, we may be subject to litigation or other claims related to a dissolution and liquidation of the Company. If a dissolution and liquidation were pursued, our Board of Directors, in consultation with its advisors, would need to evaluate these matters and make a determination about a reasonable amount to reserve. Accordingly, if a dissolution and liquidation were pursued, we cannot be certain of the amount and/or timing of any distributions to our stockholders. In addition, if a dissolution and liquidation were pursued, our common stock would cease to trade on the effective date of the filing of the certificate of dissolution and we would close our stock transfer books and discontinue recording transfers of our common stock at that time. Accordingly, if a dissolution and liquidation were pursued, the price and liquidity of our common stock may be adversely affected. We derive most of our royalty revenues from continued sales of PegIntron, which have been in decline since 2008, and if sales of PegIntron continue to decline or sales of other drug products for which we receive royalty revenues materially decline, our results of operations and financial position could be materially harmed. We derive most of our royalty revenues from continued sales of PegIntron, which is marketed by Merck.  Royalty revenues from sales of PegIntron accounted for approximately 87%, 93% and 94% of our total royalty revenues in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Sales of PegIntron have been in decline since 2008. As a consequence, a continued decline in the sales of PegIntron could adversely affect our operating results and financial position. Merck reported that worldwide sales of PegIntron declined 24% to $496 million in 2013 compared with 2012 reflecting declines in all regions and that it believes the sales declines are attributable in part to patient treatment being delayed by health care providers in anticipation of new therapeutic options becoming available. We cannot assure you that Merck will continue to generate sales of PegIntron at levels that would enable us to receive royalties in amounts that are comparable with the amounts of royalties that we have received in recent years. The amount and timing of resources dedicated by Merck to the marketing of PegIntron is not within our control. Our royalty revenues will be negatively affected if sales of PegIntron are limited for any reason, including if Merck cannot market PegIntron effectively as a result of competitive, manufacturing, regulatory or other issues.   15  Products that compete with PegIntron have been and potentially will be introduced by other drug manufacturers. Hoffmann-La Roche’s PEGASYS, a competing PEGylated interferon alfa, has resulted in significant competitive pressure on PegIntron sales in the U.S. and all international markets. PEGASYS has taken market share away from PegIntron and the overall market for PEGylated alpha-interferon for the treatment of hepatitis C has been contracting. As a result, sales of PegIntron in certain markets where it competes with PEGASYS and the royalties we receive on those sales have declined. We cannot assure you that PEGASYS will not continue to gain market share at the expense of PegIntron which could result in lower PegIntron sales and lower royalties to us.  On December 6, 2013, the FDA approved Gilead’s Sovaldi (sofosbuvir) 400 mg tablets, a once-daily oral nucleotide analog polymerase inhibitor for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection as a component of a combination antiviral treatment regimen. Sovaldi was approved in combination with peg-interferon alpha and ribavirin for genotype 1 and 4 patients, and in combination with ribavirin for genotype 2 and 3 patients. On January 17, 2014, the European Commission granted marketing authorization for Sovaldi. We expect that the adoption of Sovaldi will have a negative impact on PegIntron revenues. There are several novel agents in various stages of preclinical and clinical development for the treatment of hepatitis C, which either include or eliminate combination with pegylated interferon-based therapies. It is possible that this research could lead to a competing product or ultimately to interferon-free combination therapy in the future. We may not be able to sustain profitability and we may incur losses over the next several years. We have incurred losses in the past and have limited sources of revenues. Our revenues and operating results will likely fluctuate in future periods due to variations in our royalty revenues. We expect to continue to incur operating expenses and anticipate that we could have significant expenses in the foreseeable future. In addition, if our Board of Directors decides in the future to pursue a dissolution and liquidation of the Company, the implementation of any transaction that might result from any such dissolution or liquidation process, which could further reduce our existing capital, including legal and financial advisor fees or related actions could involve incurring material expenses. Our rights to receive royalties on sales of PegIntron and sales of other drug products will eventually expire and we currently do not intend on acquiring new sources of royalty revenues. Merck’s obligation to pay us royalties on sales of PegIntron terminates, on a country-by-country basis, upon the later of the date on which the last patent to contain a claim covering PegIntron expires in the country or 15 years after the date on which PegIntron was first approved for commercial marketing in such country.  Currently, expirations of our right to receive royalties on sales of PegIntron are expected to occur in 2016 in the U.S., 2018 in Europe and 2019 in Japan.  Our rights to receive royalties under our agreement with Nektar relating to CIMZIA and Macugen expire in 2014 in the U.S. and as late as 2018 in countries outside the U.S.  We currently do not intend on acquiring new sources of royalty revenues.  As a result, following expirations of our rights to receive royalties on sales of PegIntron and sales of other drug products, we may not have sufficient revenues to continue operations. If we do not realize the expected benefits from the reduction in our workforce that was completed in 2013 and from future cost savings initiatives that we may implement, the value of the Company and our assets and the market price of our common stock could materially decline. In December 2012, we announced a plan to reduce our workforce by approximately 15-20 employees, and in March 2013, we announced a plan to further reduce our workforce from 19 employees to 12 employees. As of the date of this report, we have one employee. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to realize additional cost savings and other anticipated benefits from our recent reductions in force.   As a result of the reduction in our workforce that was completed in 2013, we have reallocated certain employment responsibilities and outsourced certain corporate functions, which make us more dependent on third-parties to perform these corporate functions. As a result of the reduction in our workforce that was completed in 2013, we have outsourced certain corporate functions, which make us more dependent on third-parties for the performance of these functions. In addition, this reduction in our workforce has had a negative impact on our ability to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and effective disclosure controls and procedures. To the extent that we are unable to effectively reallocate employee responsibilities, retain key employees as consultants, maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and effective disclosure controls and procedures, establish and maintain agreements with competent third-party contractors on terms that are acceptable to us, or effectively manage the work performed by any retained third-party contractors, our ability to manage the operations of our business effectively could be compromised.    16  We may be subject to a variety of types of product liability or other claims based on allegations that the use of our product candidates by participants in our clinical trials has resulted in adverse effects, and our insurance may not cover all product liability or other claims. We may face liability claims related to the use or misuse of our product candidates in previously conducted clinical trials. These claims may be expensive to defend and may result in large judgments against us. Any such claims against us, regardless of their merit, might result in significant costs to defend or awards against us, and our insurance coverage and resources may not be sufficient to satisfy any liability resulting from such claims. A successful product liability or other claim brought against us could cause the market price of our common stock to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and materially harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. We depend on patents and proprietary rights, which may offer only limited protection against potential infringement and the development of competing products. The pharmaceutical industry places considerable importance on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for new technologies, products and processes. If we are unable to obtain and enforce patent protection for our product candidates or to maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets, the value of our intellectual property portfolio could be harmed. We have an extensive portfolio of issued U.S. patents and filed applications, many of which have foreign counterparts. Although we believe that our patents provide certain protection from competition, such patents may not provide substantial protection or commercial benefit to us, or afford us adequate protection from competing products, and may be challenged or declared invalid. In addition, U.S. patents or foreign patent equivalents may not be issued to us in the future. Issued patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. In addition, court decisions may introduce uncertainty as to the enforceability or scope of patents owned by biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including us. The legal systems of certain countries do not favor the aggressive enforcement of patents, and the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. Therefore, enforceability or scope of our patents in the U.S. or in foreign countries cannot be predicted with certainty, and, as a result, any patents that we own or license may not provide sufficient protection against competitors. In addition, we may not be able to obtain or maintain a patent from our pending patent applications, those we may file in the future, or those we may license from third parties. We believe that our patent rights are enforceable. However, those rights may prove unenforceable or invalid, or will expire. If we are not able to protect our patent positions, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected, which could adversely affect the market value of our common stock. We may become aware that certain organizations are engaging in activities that infringe certain of our patents. We may be unable to enforce our patents and other rights against such organizations. Legal or administrative proceedings may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend against claims of infringement. We have in the past been involved in patent litigation and other proceedings and we may likely become involved in additional patent litigation or proceedings in the future. If we become involved in any such litigation or proceeding, irrespective of the outcome, we may incur substantial costs, the efforts of our technical and management personnel may be diverted, and such disputes could substantially delay or prevent our product development or commercialization activities, which could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.   17  We are party to license and other collaboration agreements that contain complex commercial terms that could result in disputes, litigation or indemnification liability that could cause the value of the Company and our assets and the market price of our common stock to decline. We are party to license, collaboration and other agreements with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. These agreements contain complex commercial terms, including royalties on drug sales based on a number of complex variables (including net sales calculations, geography, scope of patent claim coverage, patent life and other factors) and indemnification obligations. From time to time, we may have dispute resolution discussions with third parties regarding the appropriate interpretation of the complex commercial terms contained in our agreements. One or more disputes may arise or escalate in the future regarding our agreements that may ultimately result in costly litigation and unfavorable interpretation of contract terms, which could cause the value of the Company and our assets and the market price of our common stock to decline.  We are party to license agreements whereby we may receive royalties from products subject to regulatory approval. Our licensees may be unable to maintain regulatory approvals for currently licensed products or obtain regulatory approvals for new products. Safety issues could also result in the failure to maintain regulatory approvals or decrease revenues. Risks Relating to Our Common Stock  The price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile. Historically, the market price of our common stock has fluctuated over a wide range, and it is likely that the price of our common stock will continue to be volatile in the future. The market price of our common stock could be impacted due to a variety of factors, including, in addition to global and industry-wide events: ·the level of revenues we generate from royalties we receive;·changes in our business strategy;·the losses we may incur;·developments in patent or other proprietary rights owned or licensed by us, our collaborative partners or our competitors;·public concern as to the safety and efficacy of products developed by us or others; and·litigation. In addition, due to one or more of the foregoing factors in one or more future quarters, our results of operations may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In that event, the market price of our common stock could materially decline.  The declaration of dividends is within the discretion of our Board of Directors, subject to any applicable limitations under Delaware corporate law. Our ability to pay dividends in the future depends on, among other things, our future royalty revenues, which are expected to decrease over time, as well as our ability to manage expenses, including costs relating to our ongoing operations. In April 2013, we announced that our Board of Directors intends to distribute excess cash, expected to arise from ongoing royalty revenues, in the form of periodic dividends to our stockholders. In June and December 2013, respectively, the Company paid special dividends of $1.60 and $0.45 per share. The declaration of dividends is within the discretion of our Board of Directors, subject to any applicable limitations under Delaware corporate law, and therefore our Board of Directors could decide in the future not to declare dividends. In addition, our ability to pay dividends in the future depends on, among other things, our future revenues from existing royalties and our ability to manage expenses, including costs relating to our ongoing operations. Our future revenues from existing royalties are expected to decrease over time (and eventually cease altogether) due to eventual expirations over time of our right to receive royalties under the terms of our existing licensing arrangements. Future revenues from existing royalties may also decline due to decreases in the sales of the drug products for which we have the right to receive royalties. There is no assurance that we will have sufficient royalty revenues to be able to pay dividends in the future. Any inability to pay dividends could cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly Events with respect to our capital stock could cause the number of shares of our common stock outstanding to increase and thereby cause our stockholders to suffer significant dilution. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the open market, or the availability of such shares for sale, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. As of December 31, 2013, we had 44,085,870 shares of common stock outstanding. As of that date, the following securities that may be exercised for, or are convertible into, shares of our common stock were outstanding:   18  ·Options. Stock options to purchase 2.1 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of approximately $6.90 per share.·Restricted stock units. Approximately 0.2 million shares of our common stock are issuable in respect of outstanding restricted stock units held by officers, employees and directors. The shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of options and the settlement of restricted stock are currently registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and, therefore, once those shares of common stock are issued, they may be eligible for public resale. As a result, if a large number of shares of our common stock are sold into the public market, or if there is an expectation of such sales, these sales or expectations of these sales could cause the market price of our common stock to decline. Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware corporate law may make it more difficult to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders. Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware corporate law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders. These anti-takeover provisions include: ·lack of a provision for cumulative voting in the election of directors;·the ability of our board to authorize the issuance of “blank check” preferred stock to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;·advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and·limitations on who may call a special meeting of stockholders. The provisions described above and provisions of Delaware corporate law relating to business combinations with interested stockholders may discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us. These provisions may also discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring a large portion of our securities, or initiating a tender offer, even if our stockholders might receive a premium for their shares in the acquisition over the then current market price. We also have agreements with our executive officers that provide for change of control severance benefits which provides for cash severance, restricted stock, restricted stock units and option award vesting acceleration and other benefits in the event our employees are terminated (or, in some cases, resign for specified reasons) following an acquisition or other change in control. These agreements could discourage a third party from acquiring us. The issuance of preferred stock may adversely affect rights of our common stockholders. Under our certificate of incorporation, our board of directors has the authority to issue up to three million shares of “blank check” preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by our stockholders. The rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to the rights of the holders of any shares of preferred stock that may be issued in the future. In addition to discouraging a takeover, as discussed above, this “blank check” preferred stock may have rights, including economic rights senior to the common stock, and, as a result, the issuance of such preferred stock could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock.   19  A small number of stockholders own a large percentage of our common stock and can influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval. A small number of our stockholders own a large percentage of our common stock and can therefore influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval. Based on information known to us as of the date of this report, our four largest stockholders collectively control approximately 37.8% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders collectively have the ability to influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval. These stockholders may support proposals and actions with which you may disagree. The concentration of ownership could also delay or prevent a change in control of the Company or otherwise discourage a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of the Company, which in turn could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.  If we are unable to satisfy the continued listing requirements of The NASDAQ Stock Market, our common stock could be delisted and the price and liquidity of our common stock may be adversely affected. Our common stock may lose value and our common stock could be delisted from NASDAQ due to several factors or a combination of such factors. While our common stock is currently listed on The NASDAQ Stock Market, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain such listing. To maintain the listing of our common stock on The NASDAQ Stock Market, we are required to meet certain listing requirements, including, among others, a requirement to maintain a minimum closing bid price of $1.00 per share. If our common stock trades below the $1.00 minimum closing bid price requirement for 30 consecutive business days or if we do not meet other listing requirements, we may be notified by NASDAQ of non-compliance. Our common stock recently closed below $1.00 per share on January 27, 2014 and has been closing at or below $1.00 per share since that date. In addition, the payment of future dividends, if any, to our stockholders, together with eventual expirations over time of our right to receive royalties under the terms of our existing licensing arrangements, would be expected to result in a reduction over time in the per-share trading price of our common stock. If the price per share of our common stock were to fall below NASDAQ listing standards, our common stock may be delisted. If we are notified by NASDAQ of non-compliance with the $1.00 minimum closing bid price requirement, we would regain compliance if our common stock trades above $1.00 per share for ten consecutive business days during the 180 days following notice of non-compliance. To increase the per share trading price of our common stock, we may decide to seek to implement a reverse stock split. However, there can be no assurance that we would pursue a reverse stock split or be able to obtain the approvals necessary to effect a reverse stock split. In addition, there can be no assurance that, following any reverse stock split, the per share trading price of our common stock would remain above $1.00 per share or that we would be able to continue to meet other listing requirements. If our common stock is delisted, market liquidity for our common stock could be severely affected and our stockholders’ ability to sell their shares of our common stock could be limited. In addition, our common stock could be subject to “penny stock” rules which impose additional disclosure requirements on broker-dealers and could further negatively impact our market liquidity for our common stock and our stockholders’ ability to sell their shares of our common stock. Accordingly, a delisting of our common stock from NASDAQ would negatively affect the value of our common stock. Delisting could also have other negative results, including, but not limited to, the loss of institutional investor interest.    20  "

company and our assets and the market price of our common stock to decline significantly. For example,if a transaction is not consummated, the market price of our common stock may decline to the extent that the market price reflectsan expectation that a transaction will be consummated. If our sale review process does notresult in the sale of our company, our Board of Directors may decide to pursue a dissolution and liquidation of our company. There can be no assurancethat our sale review process will result in the sale of our company. Ifour sale review process does not result in the sale of our company, our Board of Directors may decide to pursue a dissolutionand liquidation of our company. If our Boardof Directors were to approve and recommend, and our stockholders were to approve, a dissolution and liquidation of our company,we would be required under Delaware corporate law to pay our outstanding obligations, as well as to make reasonable provisionfor contingent and unknown obligations, prior to making any distributions in liquidation to our stockholders. Our commitmentsand contingent liabilities may include (i) obligations under our employment and separation agreements with certain members ofits management that provide for severance and other payments following a termination of employment occurring for various reasons,including a change in control of our company, (ii) various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of businessand (iii) non-cancelable lease obligations. As a result of this requirement, a portion of our assets may need to be reserved pendingthe resolution of such obligations. In addition,we may be subject to litigation or other claims related to a dissolution and liquidation of our company.  If a dissolutionand liquidation were pursued, our Board of Directors, in consultation with its advisors, would need to evaluate these mattersand make a determination about a reasonable amount to reserve. Accordingly, if a dissolution and liquidation were pursued, wecannot be certain of the amount and/or timing of any distributions to our stockholders. We may incur losses over the next severalyears and may never achieve or sustain profitability. We have incurred lossesin the past and have limited sources of revenues. We may incur losses in the future, including for the year ending December 31,2013. We expect to continue to incur operating expenses and anticipate that we could have significant expenses in the foreseeablefuture involving the implementation of any transaction that might result from our sale review process, which could further reduceour existing capital, including legal and financial advisor fees. If we do not consummate a transaction that might result fromour sale review process, we may still be responsible for the payment of substantial legal and financial advisor fees incurredin connection with our sale review process. These fees might result in an increase in our professional services expenses. We have substantially suspendedall clinical development activities and our review of a possible sale of one or more of our clinical development programs isuncertain. In December 2012,we announced plans to suspend all clinical development activities. Consistent with this announcement, we have substantiallysuspended all clinical development activities with a goal of conserving capital and maximizing value returned to ourstockholders. As a result of our December 2012 announcement, werecorded $11.3 million of non-cash impairment charges related to our property and equipment. Our sale review process includesa review of the possible sale or disposition of one or more of our clinical development programs. There can be noassurance that our sale review process will result in any definitive offer to acquire our clinical developmentprograms, or if made what the terms thereof will be or that any other transaction involving our clinicaldevelopment programs will be approved or consummated. If any definitive offer to acquire our clinical developmentprograms is made, there can be no assurance that a definitive agreement will be executed or that, if a definitive agreementis executed, the transaction will be consummated. In addition, there can be no assurance that any transaction involving our programs that is consummated would deliver the anticipated benefits or enhance stockholder value. Our financial results are heavilydependent on the continued sales of PegIntron on which we receive royalties, and if revenues from these royalties or royaltiesfrom the sales other products materially decline, our results of operations and financial position could be materially harmed. Our results of operationsare heavily dependent on the royalty revenues we receive from the sale of PegIntron, which is marketed by Merck and sales of whichhave been in decline since 2008. As a consequence, a continued decline  19  in the sales of PegIntron could adverselyaffect our operating results and financial position. We cannot assure you that Merck will continue to generate sales of PegIntronat levels that would enable us to receive royalties in amounts that are comparable with the amounts of royalties that we havereceived in recent years. The amount and timing of resources dedicated by Merck to the marketing of PegIntron is not within ourcontrol. Our royalty revenues will be negatively affected if sales of PegIntron are limited for any reason, including if Merckcannot market PegIntron effectively as a result of competitive, manufacturing, regulatory or other issues. Products that competewith PegIntron have been and potentially will be introduced by other drug manufacturers. Hoffmann-La Roche’s PEGASYS, acompeting PEGylated interferon alfa, has resulted in significant competitive pressure on PegIntron sales in the U.S. and all internationalmarkets. PEGASYS has taken market share away from PegIntron and the overall market for PEGylated alpha-interferon for the treatmentof hepatitis C has been contracting. As a result, sales of PegIntron in certain markets where it competes with PEGASYS and theroyalties we receive on those sales have declined. We cannot assure you that PEGASYS will not continue to gain market share atthe expense of PegIntron which could result in lower PegIntron sales and lower royalties to us. There are several novel agentsin various stages of preclinical and clinical development for the treatment of hepatitis C which either include or eliminate combinationwith pegylated interferon-based therapies. It is possible that this research could lead to a competing product or ultimately tointerferon-free combination therapy in the future. If we do not realize the expected benefitsfrom the reduction in our workforce that was contemplated in our December 2012 announcement and from future cost savings initiativesthat we may implement, the value of our company and our assets and the market price of our common stock could materially decline. In December 2012,we made an announcement that contemplated a reduction in our workforce of approximately 15-20 employees. We cannot guarantee thatwe will be able to realize the cost savings and other anticipated benefits from this reduction in force, or that this reductionin force will not interfere with our ability to identify and consummate a transaction that might result from our sale review process.In addition, we expect that we will incur approximately $1.4 million in charges related to this reduction in force, all of whichwould result in cash expenditures for one-time employee termination benefits and associated costs, and these expenditures couldcause the value of our company and our assets and the market price of our common stock to decline. As part of the assessmentof internal control over financial reporting, a material weakness was identified and our management has concluded that, asof December 31, 2012, our internal control over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures were noteffective. Any failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or effective disclosure controlsand procedures could adversely affect our ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information timely andaccurately. Our management is responsiblefor establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the SecuritiesExchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)). As disclosed in Item 9A. Controls and Procedures of this AnnualReport on Form 10-K, a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting was identified. A material weakness isa control deficiency, or a combination of control deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatementof the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected. This material weakness related to accounting fornon-routine complex technical accounting matters. Our management concluded that as of December 31, 2012 our internal control overfinancial reporting was not effective because of the existence of this material weakness. In light of this material weakness, ourprincipal executive officer and principal financial officer also concluded that, as of December 31, 2012, our disclosure controlsand procedures were ineffective. In light of this material weakness, we have taken steps to remediate our review process relatedto accounting for non-routine complex technical accounting matters. While we believe these steps have improved the effectivenessof our internal control over financial reporting, our remediation efforts could be insufficient to address the material weaknessand additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could be identified in the future. Any failureto maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or effective disclosure controls and procedures could adverselyaffect our ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information timely and accurately, which could adverselyaffect our ability to identify and consummate a transaction that might result from our sale review process and could thereforecause the market price of our common stock to decline. As a result of the reduction in ourworkforce that was contemplated in our December 2012 announcement, we are in the process of reallocating certain employment responsibilitiesand may outsource certain corporate functions which could make us more dependent on third-parties to perform these corporate functions. As a resultof the reduction in our workforce that was contemplated in our December 2012 announcement, we may be required tooutsource certain corporate functions, which will make us more dependent on third-parties for the performance of thesefunctions. In addition, this reduction in our workforce has had a negative impact on our ability to maintain effectiveinternal control over financial reporting and effective disclosure controls and procedures. To the extent that we areunable to effectively reallocate employee responsibilities, retain key employees, maintain effective internal control overfinancial reporting and effective disclosure controls and procedures, establish and maintain agreements with competentthird-party contractors on terms that are acceptable to us, or effectively manage the work performed by any retainedthird-party contractors, our ability to identify and consummate a transaction that might result from our sale review processcould be adversely affected.  20  We may be subject to a variety of typesof product liability or other claims based on allegations that the use of our product candidates by participants in our clinicaltrials has resulted in adverse effects, and our insurance may not cover all product liability or other claims. We may face liabilityclaims related to the use or misuse of our product candidates in previously conducted clinical trials. These claims may be expensiveto defend and may result in large judgments against us. Any such claims against us, regardless of their merit, might result insignificant costs to defend or awards against us, and our insurance coverage and resources may not be sufficient to satisfy anyliability resulting from such claims. A successful product liability or other claim brought against us could cause the marketprice of our common stock to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and materiallyharm our business, financial condition or results of operations. We depend on patents and proprietaryrights, which may offer only limited protection against potential infringement and the development of competing products. The pharmaceuticalindustry places considerable importance on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for new technologies, products and processes.If we are unable to obtain and enforce patent protection for our product candidates or to maintain the confidentiality of ourtrade secrets, the value of our intellectual property portfolio could be harmed and our ability to identify and consummate a transactionthat might result from our sale review process could be adversely affected. We have an extensive portfolio of issued U.S. patentsand filed applications, many of which have foreign counterparts. In addition, under our license agreements, we have exclusivelylicensed patents related to our HIF-1 alpha, and AR antagonists and our other LNA compounds. Although we believe that our patentsprovide certain protection from competition, such patents may not provide substantial protection or commercial benefit to us,or afford us adequate protection from competing products, and may be challenged or declared invalid. In addition, U.S. patentsor foreign patent equivalents may not be issued to us in the future. Issued patents maybe challenged, invalidated or circumvented. In addition, court decisions may introduce uncertainty as to the enforceability orscope of patents owned by biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including us. The legal systems of certain countries donot favor the aggressive enforcement of patents, and the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extentas the laws of the U.S. Therefore, enforceability or scope of our patents in the U.S. or in foreign countries cannot be predictedwith certainty, and, as a result, any patents that we own or license may not provide sufficient protection against competitors.In addition, we may not be able to obtain or maintain a patent from our pending patent applications, those we may file in thefuture, or those we may license from third parties. We believe that ourpatent rights are enforceable. However, those rights may prove unenforceable or invalid, or will expire. If we are not able toprotect our patent positions, our business and financial condition, as well as our ability to identify and consummate a transactionthat might result from our sale review process could be adversely affected. We may become aware that certain organizations areengaging in activities that infringe certain of our patents, including our PEGylation technology patents. We may be unable toenforce our patents and other rights against such organizations. Legal or administrativeproceedings may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend against claims of infringement. We havein the past been involved in patent litigation and other proceedings and we may likely become involved in additional patent litigationor proceedings in the future. If we become involved in any such litigation or proceeding, irrespective of the outcome, we mayincur substantial costs, the efforts of our technical and management personnel may be diverted, and such disputes could substantiallydelay or prevent our product development or commercialization activities, which could materially harm our business, financialcondition and results of operations. The patents upon which our originalPEGylation technology was based have expired and, as a result, the scope of our patent protection is narrower. The U.S and correspondingforeign patents upon which our original PEGylation technology was based expired in 1996. Without that patent protection, otherparties are permitted to make, use or sell products covered by the claims of those patents, subject to other patents, includingthose which we hold. We have obtained numerous patents with claims covering improved methods of attaching or linking PEG to therapeuticcompounds. However, these patents may not  21  enable us to prevent competition or competitors may develop alternative methods of attachingPEG to compounds potentially resulting in competitive products outside the protection that may be afforded by our patents. Weare aware that others have also filed patent applications and have been granted patents in the U.S. and other countries with respectto the application of PEG to proteins and other compounds. We are party to license and other collaboration agreementsthat contain complex commercial terms that could result in disputes, litigation or indemnification liability that could causethe value of our company and our assets and the market price of our common stock to decline. We are party to license, collaborationand other agreements with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. These agreements contain complex commercial terms, includingroyalties on drug sales based on a number of complex variables (including net sales calculations, geography, scope of patent claimcoverage, patent life and other factors) and indemnification obligations. From time to time, we may have dispute resolution discussionswith third parties regarding the appropriate interpretation of the complex commercial terms contained in our agreements. One ormore disputes may arise or escalate in the future regarding our agreements that may ultimately result in costly litigation andunfavorable interpretation of contract terms, which could cause the value of our company and our assets and the market price ofour common stock to decline. Risks Relating to Our Common Stockand our Convertible Notes The price of our common stockhas been, and may continue to be, volatile, which also may significantly affect the trading price of our 4% convertiblenotes due 2013. Historically, themarket price of our common stock has fluctuated over a wide range, and it is likely that the price of our common stock will continueto be volatile in the future.

As a result, if a large number of shares of our common stock are sold intothe public market, or if there is an expectation of such sales, these sales or expectations of these sales could cause the marketprice of our common stock to decline. The conversion ofsome or all of our 4% convertible notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders. Any sales in the publicmarket of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.In addition, the existence of the notes may encourage short selling by market participants which could depress the market priceof our common stock. Anti-takeover provisions in our charterdocuments and under Delaware corporate law may make it more difficult to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficialto our stockholders.  Provisions of ourcertificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware corporate law, could make it more difficult for a thirdparty to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders. These anti-takeover provisions include: ·lack                                                                                                               of a provision                                                                                                               for cumulative                                                                                                               voting in the election                                                                                                               of directors;·the                                                                                                               ability of our                                                                                                               board to authorize                                                                                                               the issuance of                                                                                                               “blank check”                                                                                                               preferred stock                                                                                                               to increase the                                                                                                               number of outstanding                                                                                                               shares and thwart                                                                                                               a takeover attempt;·advance                                                                                                               notice requirements                                                                                                               for nominations                                                                                                               for election to                                                                                                               the board of directors                                                                                                               or for proposing                                                                                                               matters that can                                                                                                               be acted upon by                                                                                                               stockholders at                                                                                                               stockholder meetings;                                                                                                               and·limitations                                                                                                               on who may call                                                                                                               a special meeting                                                                                                               of stockholders. The provisions describedabove and provisions of Delaware corporate law relating to business combinations with interested stockholders may discourage,delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us. These provisions may also discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiringa large portion of our securities, or initiating a tender offer, even if our stockholders might receive a premium for their sharesin the acquisition over the then current market price. We also have agreements with our executive officers that provide for changeof control severance benefits which provides for cash severance, restricted stock, restricted stock units and option award vestingacceleration and other benefits in the event our employees are terminated (or, in some cases, resign for specified reasons) followingan acquisition or other change in control. These agreements could discourage a third party from acquiring us. The issuance of preferred stock may adversely affect rightsof our common stockholders. Under our certificateof incorporation, our board of directors has the authority to issue up to three million shares of “blank check” preferredstock and to determine the price, rights, preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by ourstockholders. The rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to the rights of the holders of any shares of preferredstock that may be issued in the future. In addition to discouraging a takeover, as discussed above, this “blank check”preferred stock may have rights, including economic rights senior to the common stock, and, as a result, the issuance of suchpreferred stock could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock. The market for unrated debt is subjectto disruptions that could have an adverse effect on the market price of our 4% convertible notes, or a market for our notes mayfail to develop or be sustained. Our 4% convertiblenotes are not rated. As a result, holders of the notes have the risks associated with an investment in unrated debt. Historically,the market for unrated debt has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of such securitiesand greatly reduced liquidity for the holders of such securities. When 23  the notes are traded, they may trade ata discount from their initial offering price, depending on, among other things, prevailing interest rates, the markets for similarsecurities, general economic conditions and our financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The liquidity of, andtrading markets for, the notes also may be adversely affected by general declines in the market for unrated debt. Such declinesmay adversely affect the liquidity of, and trading markets for, the notes, independent of our financial performance or prospects.In addition, certain regulatory restrictions prohibit certain types of financial institutions from investing in unrated debt,which may further suppress demand for such securities. We cannot assure you that the market for the notes will not be subjectto similar disruptions or that any market for our notes will develop or be sustained. Any such disruptions may have an adverseeffect on the holders of the notes. Our 4% convertible notes matureon June 1, 2013 and the use of our cash to satisfy this debt will reduce our liquidity and capital resources. Asof December 31, 2012, we had $115.8 million in aggregate principal amount of our 4% convertible notes outstanding.On June 1, 2013, the outstanding aggregate principal amount of our 4% convertible notes will become due and payable andwe will be required to use our cash, cash equivalents and/or marketable securities to repay the notes at maturity, which willreduce our liquidity and capital resources. A small number of stockholders owna large percentage of our common stock and can influence the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval. A small number ofour stockholders own a large percentage of our common stock and can therefore influence the outcome of matters submitted to ourstockholders for approval. Based on information known to us as of the date of this report, our five largest stockholders collectivelycontrol a majority of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders collectively have the ability to influencethe outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders for approval, including any transaction that might result from our sale reviewprocess and submitted to our stockholders for approval. These stockholders may support proposals and actions with which you maydisagree. The concentration of ownership could also delay or prevent a change in control of our company or otherwise discouragea potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of our company, which in turn could cause the market price of our commonstock to decline. 24  "
14,ENZN,ENZON PHARMACEUTICALS INC,2011-03-16," Risk Factors
Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have made forward-looking statements in an attempt to better enable the reader to understand our future prospects and make informed judgments. By their nature, forward-looking statements are subject to numerous factors that may influence outcomes or even prevent their eventual  realization. Such factors may be external to Enzon and entirely outside our control.We cannot guarantee that our assumptions and expectations will be correct. Failure of events to be achieved or of certain underlying assumptions to prove accurate could cause actual results to vary materially from past results and those anticipated or projected. We do not intend to update forward-looking statements.16Certain risks and uncertainties are discussed below. However, it is not possible to predict or identify all such factors. Accordingly, you should not consider this recitation to be complete.Risks Relating to Our BusinessWe expect to incur losses over the next several years and may never achieve or sustain profitability.We have limited sources of revenues and we expect to incur losses over the next several years including for the year ending December 31, 2011. We also expect to spend significant amounts to continue research and development of our product candidates and technologies.None of our product candidates have been approved by the FDA and none of them have been commercialized. We do not know when we will have products approved by the FDA or commercialized, if ever. In the absence of revenue from the sale of products or other new sources, our losses will continue as we conduct our research  and development activities.Development of any successful product candidates is highly uncertain due to the extended testing and regulatory review process required before marketing clearance can be obtained and failure to develop, obtain regulatory approval and commercialize our product candidates could materially harm our business.There is a high risk of failure for pharmaceutical product candidates. Only a small minority of all research and development programs ultimately result in commercially successful drugs. We may never succeed in developing an approved drug. Further, due to the extended testing and regulatory review process required before  marketing clearance can be obtained, the time periods before commercialization of any of these products are long and uncertain. Risks during development and commercialization include the possibility that: any or all of our product candidates will be found to be ineffective; our product candidates will have adverse side effects or will  otherwise fail to receive the necessary regulatory approvals; our product candidates may be effective but uneconomical to manufacture or market; or our competitors may market equivalent or superior products.The risk of failure is increased for our product candidates that are based on new technologies or approaches to the development of therapeutics. For example, the LNA technology is a novel technology and there are currently no approved drugs, or even late-stage drug candidates, employing this technology. Product candidates  employing these technologies may not advance to pivotal stages of product development or demonstrate clinical safety or efficacy. If we do not succeed in the development of these product candidates, or if our technologies fail to generate products, our business could be materially harmed.From time to time, we may establish and announce certain development goals for our product candidates and programs; however, given the complex nature of the drug discovery and development process, it is difficult to predict accurately if and when we will achieve these goals. If we are unsuccessful in advancing our preclinical  programs into clinical testing, advancing our clinical programs into later clinical phases, or in obtaining regulatory approval, our business prospects may be harmed.We do not expect any of the drugs resulting from our current research and development efforts to be commercially available for several years, if at all. In order to fill our pipeline of product candidates under development, we may attempt to acquire rights to products under development by other companies. The competition for the  acquisition of rights to products that are viewed as viable candidates for successful development and commercialization is intense, and we will be competing for such opportunities with many companies with resources that are substantially greater than ours.Our financial results are heavily dependent on the continued sales of PEGINTRON on which we receive royalties; if revenues from these royalties materially decline, our results of operations and financial position could be materially harmed.Our results of operations are heavily dependent on the royalty revenues we receive on the sale of PEGINTRON, marketed by Merck. As a consequence, a continued decline in the sales of PEGINTRON could adversely affect our operating results and financial position. We cannot assure you that Merck will continue to17generate sales of PEGINTRON at levels that would enable us to receive royalties in amounts that are comparable with the amounts of royalties we have received in recent years. The amount and timing of resources dedicated by Merck to the marketing of PEGINTRON is not within our control. Our royalty revenues will be negatively  affected if sales of PEGINTRON are limited for any reason, including if Merck cannot market PEGINTRON effectively as a result of competitive, manufacturing, regulatory or other issues.Products that compete with PEGINTRON have been and potentially will be introduced by other drug manufacturers. Hoffmann-La Roches Pegasys, a competing PEGylated interferon-based combination therapy, has resulted in significant competitive pressure on PEGINTRON sales in the U.S. and all international markets. Pegasys  has taken market share away from PEGINTRON and the overall market for PEGylated alpha-interferon for the treatment of hepatitis C has been contracting. As a result, sales of PEGINTRON in certain markets where it competes with Pegasys and the royalties we receive on those sales have declined. We cannot assure you that Pegasys  will not continue to gain market share at the expense of PEGINTRON which could result in lower PEGINTRON sales and lower royalties to us. There are several novel agents in various stages of preclinical and clinical development in combination with PEGylated interferon for the treatment of hepatitis C. It is possible that this research  could lead to a competing product or ultimately to Interferon-free combination therapy in the future.We may require additional financing to meet our future capital needs and failure to obtain such funding could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operations.Our research and development projects require substantial capital. We will continue to expend substantial resources for research and development, including costs associated with developing our product candidates and conducting clinical trials. We believe that our current cash and investments will be adequate to satisfy our capital  needs for the near future, but we have limited sources of revenue and we may require additional financing to meet our future capital needs.We may require substantial additional capital to:                fund research and development activities;    conduct pre-clinical studies and clinical trials; and    undertake other activities relating to the successful development of product candidates.Our future capital needs depend on many factors, including:                the scope, duration and expenditures associated with our research and development programs;    continued scientific progress in these programs;    the outcome of potential licensing transactions, if any;    competing technological developments;    our proprietary patent position in our products; and    the regulatory approval process for our product candidates.We may seek to raise necessary funds through public or private equity offerings, debt financings or additional strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. Any additional equity financings may be on terms that are dilutive or potentially dilutive to our stockholders. Any debt financing we enter into may involve incurring significant  interest expense and include covenants that restrict our operations. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. General market conditions may make it difficult for us to seek financing from the capital markets. We may be required to relinquish rights to our technologies or drug candidates, or grant  licenses on terms that are not favorable to us, to raise additional funds through alliance, joint venture or licensing arrangements. If adequate funds are not available, we may have to delay, reduce or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs and reduce overall overhead expenses. These actions could have a material  adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operations.18We depend on our collaborative partners; if we lose our collaborative partners or they do not apply adequate resources to our collaborations, our product development and financial performance may suffer.We rely and will depend heavily in the future on collaborations with partners, primarily pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, for one or more of the research, development, manufacturing, marketing and other commercialization activities relating to most of our product candidates. If we lose our collaborative partners, or if  they do not apply adequate resources to our collaborations, our product development and financial performance may suffer.The amount and timing of resources dedicated by our collaborators to their collaborations with us are not within our control. If any collaborator breaches or terminates its agreements with us or fails to conduct its collaborative activities in a timely manner, the commercialization of our product candidates could be slowed or blocked  completely. For example, Santaris can terminate its agreement with respect to a specific LNA compound provided by them if we do not achieve certain development milestones for that compound or if we do not make certain milestone payments. In addition, our collaborative partners may change their strategic focus, pursue alternative  technologies or develop alternative products as a means of developing treatments for the diseases targeted by these collaborative programs and these could compete with products we are developing.Further, our collaborations may not be successful. Disputes may arise between us and our collaborators as to a variety of matters, including financing obligations under our agreements and ownership of intellectual property rights. These disputes may be both expensive and time-consuming and may result in delays in the development  and commercialization of products. If any of the product candidates that we are commercializing with collaborators are delayed or blocked from entering the market or we experience increased costs as a result of our relationship with our collaborators, our financial performance could be adversely affected.We purchase some of the compounds utilized in our product candidates from a single source or a limited group of suppliers, and the partial or complete loss of one of these suppliers could cause production delays and a substantial loss of revenues.We purchase the unmodified pharmaceutical compounds, bulk PEGs and other compounds used to manufacture our product candidates from outside suppliers. In some cases, we have a limited number of suppliers.Our reliance on our suppliers exposes us to significant risks. These third parties might:                be unable or unwilling to provide us with sufficient materials to meet our demands;    fail to meet our standards of quality or other specifications;    increase significantly the prices they charge us for materials; or    not carry out their contractual duties or meet anticipated deadlines, which could result in delays in obtaining or maintaining regulatory approvals.If our suppliers are unwilling or unable to timely supply us with materials meeting our specifications, we may not be able to locate any alternative suppliers or enter into commercially reasonable agreements with suppliers in a timely manner or at all. In addition, we may be unable to find alternative suppliers with appropriate  regulatory authorizations. If we experience a delay in obtaining or are unable to obtain any compound for the manufacture of our product candidates on reasonable terms, or at all, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our product candidates must undergo extensive clinical testing, the results of which are highly uncertain and could substantially delay or prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval.Before we can market a product, we must obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate. To obtain regulatory approval, we must undertake extensive clinical testing in humans to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities for each indication. The pre-clinical testing  and clinical trials for any product candidates that we develop must comply with the regulations of19numerous federal, state and local government authorities in the U.S., principally the FDA, and those of similar agencies in other countries. Clinical trials of new product candidates sufficient to obtain regulatory marketing approval are expensive and take years to complete.Even though they consume substantial resources, the outcome of these trials is highly uncertain. Safety and efficacy results from pre-clinical studies involving animals and other models and from early clinical trials are often not accurate indicators of results of later-stage clinical trials that involve larger human populations, and,  moreover, may not always be representative of results obtained while marketing an approved drug, particularly with regard to safety. In addition, we may suffer significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after achieving promising results in earlier trials. For example, Phase II data may not replicate Phase I results or Phase III efficacy data  may not replicate Phase II data. Any adverse results from studies, including clinical trials, could have a negative effect on our ability to obtain the approval of the FDA or other regulatory agencies. Unfavorable results of clinical trials conducted by our competitors or other biotechnology companies could also adversely affect our ability to  gain regulatory approval of our product candidates by increasing government examination and complexity of clinical trials. Government and public concerns over safety issues associated with pharmaceutical and biological products could potentially result in termination of clinical trials on entire classes of drug candidates, lengthen the  trial process for product categories, increase legal and production costs relating to certain drug categories, and/or expand the safety labeling for approved products.Clinical development of any product candidate that we decide to take into clinical trials may be delayed or prevented at any time for some or all of the following reasons:                negative or ambiguous results regarding the efficacy of the product candidate;    undesirable side effects that delay or extend the trials or make the product candidate not medically or commercially viable;    inability to recruit and qualify a sufficient number of patients for our trials;    regulatory delays or other regulatory actions, including changes in regulatory requirements;    difficulties in obtaining sufficient quantities of the product candidate manufactured under current good manufacturing practices;    delays, suspension or termination of the trials imposed by us, an independent institutional review board for a clinical trial site, or clinical holds placed upon the trials by the FDA; and    our failure to obtain adequate financial resources to fund these trials.We depend on third parties to conduct the clinical trials for our product candidates and any failure of those parties to fulfill their obligations could harm our development and commercialization plans.We depend on independent clinical investigators, contract research organizations, academic institutions and other third-party service providers to conduct clinical trials for our product candidates. Though we rely heavily on these parties for successful execution of our clinical trials, we are ultimately responsible for the results of their  activities and many aspects of their activities are beyond our control. For example, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial, but the independent clinical investigators may prioritize other projects over ours or may fail to timely  communicate issues regarding our products to us. Third parties may not complete activities on schedule or may not conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols. The early termination of any of our clinical trial arrangements, the failure of third parties to comply with the regulations and  requirements governing clinical trials or our reliance on results of trials that we have not directly conducted or monitored could hinder or delay the development, approval and commercialization of our product candidates and would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.If our clinical trials are not successful, if we experience significant delays in these trials, or if we do not complete our clinical trials, we may not be able to commercialize our product candidates, which would materially harm our business.20We depend on patents and proprietary rights, which may offer only limited protection against potential infringement and the development of competing products.The pharmaceutical industry places considerable importance on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for new technologies, products and processes. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to develop and maintain a strong patent position for our product candidates and technologies both in the U.S. and in other countries and  to protect our proprietary rights. If we are unable to obtain and enforce patent protection for our product candidates or to maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business could be materially harmed. We have an extensive portfolio of issued U.S. patents and filed applications, many of which have foreign counterparts. In  addition, under our license agreements, we have exclusively licensed patents related to our HIF-1 alpha, Survivin and AR antagonists and our other LNA compounds in development. Although we believe that our patents provide certain protection from competition, such patents may not provide substantial protection or commercial benefit  to us, or afford us adequate protection from competing products, and may be challenged or declared invalid. In addition, U.S. patents or foreign patent equivalents may not be issued to us in the future.Issued patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. In addition, court decisions may introduce uncertainty as to the enforceability or scope of patents owned by biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including us. The legal systems of certain countries do not favor the aggressive enforcement of patents, and the  laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. Therefore, enforceability or scope of our patents in the U.S. or in foreign countries cannot be predicted with certainty, and, as a result, any patents that we own or license may not provide sufficient protection against competitors. In addition, we  may not be able to obtain or maintain a patent from our pending patent applications, those we may file in the future, or those we may license from third parties.We believe that our patent rights are enforceable; however, those rights may prove unenforceable or invalid, or may expire prior to the commercialization of our product candidates, thus allowing others to more effectively compete with us. Therefore, any patents that we own or license may not adequately protect our product  candidates or our future products. If we are not able to protect our patent positions, our business and financial condition could be materially harmed. We may become aware that certain organizations are engaging in activities that infringe certain of our patents, including our PEGylation technology patents. We may be unable to enforce  our patents and other rights against such organizations.Legal or administrative proceedings may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend against claims of infringement. We have in the past been involved in patent litigation and other proceedings and we may likely become involved in additional patent litigation or proceedings in the future. If we become  involved in any such litigation or proceeding, irrespective of the outcome, we may incur substantial costs, the efforts of our technical and management personnel may be diverted, and such disputes could substantially delay or prevent our product development or commercialization activities, which could materially harm our business,  financial condition and results of operations.Blocking patents or claims of infringement may stop or delay the development of our product candidates.Other entities may have or obtain proprietary rights that could impair our competitive position. Our commercial success depends in part on avoiding claims of infringement of the patents or proprietary rights of such third parties. Although we investigate the patent protection surrounding our technology and product candidates, there  are numerous patents, each with multiple claims, which makes it difficult to uncover and interpret the extent of patent protection which can lead to uncertainty about our freedom to operate. It is possible that we will not be aware of issued patents or pending patent applications that are relevant to our product candidates because our  searches do not find them or because they are not yet publicly available. Our interpretation of patents could be challenged, leading to litigation, and we could face claims of infringement of rights of which we are unaware.There have been significant litigation and interference proceedings regarding patent rights, and the patent situation regarding particular products is often complex and uncertain. As we proceed with the development of our product candidates, we may face uncertainty and litigation could result, which could lead to liability for21damages, prevent our development and commercialization efforts and divert resources from our business strategy.Third parties from time to time may assert that we are infringing their patents, trade secrets or know-how. In addition, our technology may infringe patents that may issue in the future to third parties. We could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves and our partners against any such claims. Furthermore, parties making such  claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability or our partners ability to further develop or commercialize some or all of our products or technology in the U.S. and abroad, and could result in the award of substantial damages. If we are found to infringe, we may be required to  obtain one or more licenses from third parties or be unable to proceed with development or commercialization of our product candidates. We may not be able to obtain such licenses at a reasonable cost, if at all. Defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any such required license could have a material adverse effect on us.We may have to develop or license alternative technologies if we are unable to obtain key technology from third parties or maintain our rights to technology we license from third parties.We have licensed patents and patent applications from Santaris under our collaboration and license agreement with them. Some of our proprietary rights have been licensed to us under agreements that have performance requirements or other contingencies. The failure to comply with these provisions could lead to termination or  modifications of our rights to these licenses. Additionally, we may need to obtain additional licenses to patents or other proprietary rights from other parties to facilitate development of our proprietary technology base. The ownership of patents exclusively licensed to us may be subject to challenge if inventorship was not adequately  investigated and represented. If our existing licenses are terminated or if we are unable to obtain such additional licenses on acceptable terms, our ability to perform our own research and development and to comply with our obligations under our collaborative agreements may be delayed while we seek to develop or license alternative  technologies.The patents upon which our original PEGylation technology was based have expired and, as a result, the scope of our patent protection is narrower.The U.S and corresponding foreign patents upon which our original PEGylation technology was based expired in 1996. Without that patent protection, other parties are permitted to make, use or sell products covered by the claims of those patents, subject to other patents, including those which we hold. We have obtained numerous  patents with claims covering improved methods of attaching or linking PEG to therapeutic compounds. However, these patents may not enable us to prevent competition or competitors may develop alternative methods of attaching PEG to compounds potentially resulting in competitive products outside the protection that may be afforded  by our patents. We are aware that others have also filed patent applications and have been granted patents in the U.S. and other countries with respect to the application of PEG to proteins and other compounds.The manufacture of our product candidates is a complex and highly-regulated process and we rely on third-party manufacturers to manufacture materials for us. If any of them fails to meet regulatory requirements, our business could suffer.The FDA and foreign and state regulators require manufacturers to register manufacturing facilities. The FDA and these regulators also inspect these facilities to confirm compliance with current good manufacturing practices or similar requirements that the FDA and these regulators establish. The manufacture of product candidates  and key reagents at any facility is subject to strict quality control, testing, and record keeping requirements, and continuing obligations regarding the submission of safety reports and other post-market information. Ultimately, we, our third-party manufacturers, our licensees, or other suppliers may not meet these requirements. Our third-  party manufacturers may face manufacturing or quality control problems causing product production and shipment delays or a situation where we or they may not be able to maintain compliance with the FDAs current good manufacturing practices requirements or those of foreign or state regulators, necessary to continue manufacturing  our product candidates and materials. Any failure to comply22with current good manufacturing practices requirements or other FDA and foreign or state regulatory requirements could adversely affect our clinical research activities and our ability to market and develop our products candidates.We may be subject to a variety of types of product liability or other claims based on allegations that the use of our product candidates by participants in our clinical trials has resulted in adverse effects, and our insurance may not cover all product liability or other claims.We may face liability claims related to the use or misuse of our product candidates in clinical trials. These claims may be expensive to defend and may result in large judgments against us. Generally, our clinical trials are conducted in patients with serious life-threatening diseases for whom conventional treatments have been  unsuccessful and during the course of treatment these patients could suffer adverse medical effects or die for reasons that may or may not be related to our product candidates. Any of these events could result in a claim of liability. Any such claims against us, regardless of their merit, could result in significant costs to defend or awards  against us that could materially harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.Although we maintain product liability insurance for claims arising from the use of our product candidates in clinical trials prior to FDA approval and for claims arising from the use of our products after FDA approval at levels that we believe are appropriate, we may not be able to maintain our existing insurance coverage or obtain  additional coverage on commercially reasonable terms for the use of our other product candidates and products in the future. Also, our insurance coverage and resources may not be sufficient to satisfy any liability resulting from product liability claims which could materially harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.We depend on key personnel and may not be able to retain these employees or recruit additional qualified personnel, which would harm our business; we currently do not have a permanent chief financial officer.Because of the specialized scientific nature of our business, we are highly dependent upon qualified research and development scientists, technical and managerial personnel, including our President of Research and Development. There is intense competition for qualified personnel in the pharmaceutical field. Therefore, we may not  be able to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business. Although we have an employment agreement with our President of Research and Development, our ability to continue to retain him, as well as other senior executives or key managers is not assured.Effective July 23, 2010, Craig A. Tooman resigned as our Executive Vice President of Finance and Chief Financial Officer. On July 8, 2010, our board of directors appointed Mark L. Ogden, consultant to Enzon since 2005, as our acting Vice President of Finance and Principal Financial Officer following Mr. Toomans departure.  The executive committee continues to search for a permanent Chief Financial Officer.The loss of the services of one or a combination of our senior executives, particularly our President of Research and Development, as well as the failure to recruit additional key research and development scientists, technical and managerial personnel, particularly a new Chief Financial Officer, in a timely manner, could have an  adverse effect on our business.As a result of our 2010 restructuring initiatives and the related reductions in our workforce, we are in the process of reallocating certain employment responsibilities and may outsource certain corporate functions which could have the potential to affect our internal controls over financial reporting and make us more  dependent on third-parties to perform these corporate functions.In both the first and fourth quarters of 2010, we initiated restructurings which together will result in the elimination of 97 employee positions. The reductions will result in the reallocation of certain responsibilities which could adversely impact operational efficiencies, employee performance, employee retention or internal controls.  Also, as a result of these reductions, we may be required to outsource certain corporate functions which will make us more dependent on third-parties for the performance of these functions in connection with our business and product candidates. To the extent that we are unable to effectively reallocate employee23responsibilities, retain key employees, effectively design adequate internal and compensating controls, establish and maintain agreements with competent third-party contractors on terms that are acceptable to us, or effectively manage the work performed by any retained third-party contractors, our ability to advance our business or  product candidates may be significantly impaired and our stock price may be adversely affected.Risks Relating to Our IndustrySignificant competition for our technology platforms and product candidates could make our technologies or product candidates obsolete or uncompetitive, which would negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by extensive research and development effort, and rapid technological change. Our future success will depend on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to technological advances. Rapid technological development by others may result in our product candidates and  technologies becoming obsolete. We face intense competition from established biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, as well as academic and research institutions that are pursuing competing technologies and products. We know that competitors are developing or manufacturing various platform technologies and products that are  used for the prevention, diagnosis or treatment of diseases that we have targeted for product development. Current and prospective competing products may provide greater therapeutic benefits for a specific problem or may offer comparable performance at a lower cost when compared to our product candidates. In addition, any product  candidate that we develop and that obtains regulatory approval must then compete for market acceptance and market share.Our competitors in the PEGylation technology field include The Dow Chemical Company, Nektar Pharmaceuticals, Inc., SunBio Corporation, Mountain View Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Neose Technologies, Inc., NOF Corporation and Urigen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Several other chemical, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  may also be developing PEGylation technologies. Some of these companies license or provide the technology to other companies, while others develop the technology for internal use.Other companies are conducting research and developing products utilizing technologies targeting RNA (e.g. antisense, siRNA/RNAi or micro RNA) that compete with the LNA technology. These include Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc., Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Regulus Therapeutics LLC, Eli Lilly and Company and others. There  are a number of existing therapeutic regimens designed to treat the cancers that we may target with the HIF-1 alpha antagonist. However, we are not of aware of the development of another compound that would have a mechanism similar to our HIF-1 alpha antagonist. There are a number of existing therapeutic regimens designed to treat  the cancers that we may target with the Survivin antagonist and we are aware of several companies that are actively working on compounds targeting Survivin. There are a number of existing therapeutic regimens designed to treat the cancers that we may target with the AR antagonist. However, we are not aware of another compound that  would have a mechanism similar to our AR antagonist.There are a number of drugs in various stages of preclinical and clinical development from companies exploring cancer therapies or improved chemotherapeutic agents to potentially treat the same cancer indications that our PEG-SN38 may be developed to treat. Additionally, there are a number of drugs in development based on the  active metabolite SN38. If these drugs are approved, they could compete directly with our PEG-SN38. These include products in development from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Pfizer Inc., GlaxoSmithKline p/c, Antigenics Inc., Hoffman-La Roche Ltd., Novartis AG, Cell Therapeutics, Inc., Neopharm, Inc., Meditech Research  Limited and others. Nektar Therapeutics is also developing a PEGylated form of irinotecan. Irinotecan is a prodrug of SN38. This product candidate is currently in Phase II for colorectal cancer. Nektar has also commenced trials in breast and ovarian cancer for this product candidate.Many of our competitors have substantially greater research and development capabilities and experience and greater manufacturing, marketing and financial resources than we do. In addition, many of our competitors have much more experience than we do in pre-clinical testing and human clinical trials of new drugs, as well as in  obtaining FDA and other regulatory approval. We face competition from these companies not just in product development but also in areas such as recruiting employees, acquiring technologies that might enhance our ability to commercialize products, establishing relationships with certain research and academic institutions, enrolling  patients in clinical trials and seeking program partnerships and collaborations with larger24pharmaceutical companies. Accordingly, our competitors may develop technologies and products that are superior to those we or our collaborators are developing and render our technologies and products or those of our collaborators obsolete and noncompetitive. If we cannot compete effectively, our business and financial performance  would suffer.The regulatory approval process is highly uncertain and we will not be allowed to market products if regulatory approval has not been obtained.The marketing of pharmaceutical products in the U.S. and abroad is subject to stringent governmental regulation. The sale of any new products for use in humans in the U.S. requires the prior approval of the FDA. If our products are marketed abroad, they will also be subject to extensive regulation by foreign governments, whether  or not we have obtained FDA approval for a given product and its indications. The FDA has established mandatory procedures and safety standards that apply to the clinical testing and marketing of pharmaceutical products. The FDA regulates the research, development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness,  record-keeping, reporting, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale, distribution, import and export of pharmaceutical and biological products. Obtaining FDA approval for a new therapeutic product may take many years and involve substantial expenditures. Compliance with these regulations can be costly, time-consuming  and subject us to unanticipated delays in developing our products. Neither we nor our licensees may be able to obtain or maintain FDA or other relevant marketing approval for any of our products.There may be limitations placed on our ability to successfully market our products by the FDA or foreign regulators.Regulatory approval may:                limit the indicated uses for a product;    otherwise limit our ability to promote, sell and distribute the product;    require that we conduct costly post-marketing surveillance; and    require that we conduct ongoing post-marketing studies. Material changes to an approved product, such as manufacturing changes or revised labeling, may require further regulatory review and approval. Once obtained, any approvals may be withdrawn for a number of reasons, including the later discovery of previously unknown      problems with the product, such as a safety issue. If we or our third-party manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements at any stage during the regulatory process, such noncompliance could result in:    refusals or delays in the approval of applications or supplements to approved applications;    refusal of a regulatory authority, including the FDA, to review pending market approval applications or supplements to approved applications;    warning letters;    import or export restrictions;    product recalls or seizures;    injunctions;    total or partial suspension of production;    fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecutions; and    withdrawals of previously approved marketing applications or licenses.In addition, any approved products are subject to continuing regulation. Among other things, the holder of an approved biologic license application or new drug application is subject to periodic and other FDA monitoring and reporting obligations, including obligations to monitor and report adverse events and instances of the failure  of a product to meet the specifications in the biologic license application or new drug application. Application holders must also submit advertising and other promotional material to the FDA and report on ongoing clinical trials. Failure to meet these post-approval requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines25or other penalties, injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, or denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals.Legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We are not sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact  of such changes on the marketing approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDAs approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.Even if we are granted regulatory approval in one jurisdiction, we may not receive regulatory approval in another jurisdiction.Failure to obtain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions would prevent us from marketing our products abroad. In order to market our products in the European Union and many other jurisdictions outside the U.S., we must obtain separate regulatory approvals and comply with numerous foreign regulatory requirements. The  approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. The foreign regulatory approval process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. We may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a  timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA. We may not be able to file for regulatory approvals and may not receive necessary  approvals to commercialize our products in any market. The failure to obtain these approvals could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.If we or our licensees fail to obtain or maintain requisite governmental approvals or fail to obtain or maintain approvals of the scope requested, it will delay or preclude us or our licensees or marketing partners from marketing our products. It could also limit the commercial use of our products. Any such failure or limitation may  have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Once approved, our products may not be accepted in the marketplace.Even if clinical trials demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates and all regulatory approvals are obtained, the commercial success of our products depends on gaining market acceptance among physicians, patients, third-party payors or the medical community. The degree of market acceptance will depend on many  factors, including:                the scope of regulatory approvals, including limitations or warnings contained in a products regulatory-approved labeling;    establishment and demonstration of clinical efficacy and safety;    cost-effectiveness of our products;    alternative treatment methods and potentially competitive products; and    the availability of third-party reimbursement.Market acceptance could be further limited depending on the prevalence and severity of any expected or unexpected adverse side effects associated with our product candidates. If our product candidates are approved but do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, third-party payors and patients, we may never  generate significant revenue from these products, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially harmed.Our operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations.Our operations are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous, toxic26and radioactive substances and the discharge of pollutants into the air and water. Environmental permits and controls are required for some of our operations and these permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation by the issuing authorities. If we were to become liable for an accident, or if we were to suffer an extended  facility shutdown as a result of such contamination, we could incur significant costs, damages and penalties that could harm our business and exceed our resources or insurance coverage.The successful commercialization of our product candidates will depend on obtaining health insurance coverage and reimbursement for use of these products from third-party payors and these payors may not agree to cover or reimburse for use of our products.Our future revenues and profitability will be adversely affected if U.S. and foreign governmental, private third-party insurers and payors, and other third-party payors, including Medicare and Medicaid, do not agree to defray or reimburse the cost of our products to the patients. If these entities refuse to provide coverage and  reimbursement with respect to our products or provide an insufficient level of coverage and reimbursement, our products may be too costly for many patients to afford them, and physicians may not prescribe them. In addition, limitation on the amount of reimbursement for our products may also reduce our profitability. In the U.S. and  some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect will continue to be, actions and proposals to control and reduce healthcare costs. There have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval for our product candidates,  restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any of our product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Government and other third-party payors are also challenging the prices charged for healthcare products and increasingly limiting, and attempting to limit, both coverage and level of  reimbursement for prescription drugs.In the United States, the Medicare Modernization Act, or MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for drugs. In addition, this  legislation authorized Medicare Part D prescription drug plans to use formularies where they can limit the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. As a result of this legislation and the expansion of federal coverage of drug products, we expect that there will be additional pressure to contain and reduce costs. These  cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could decrease the coverage and price that we receive for any approved products and could seriously harm our business. While the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations  in setting their own reimbursement rates, and any reduction in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.In March 2010, President Obama signed into law the Health Care Reform Law, a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose  new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. Effective October 1, 2010, the Health Care Reform Law revised the definition of average manufacturer price for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates to states. Further, beginning in 2011, the new law  imposed a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. Substantial new provisions affecting compliance have also been enacted, which may require us to modify our business practices with healthcare practitioners. We will not know the full effects of the Health Care Reform Law  until applicable federal and state agencies issue regulations or guidance under the new law. Although it is too early to determine the effect of the Health Care Reform Law, the new law appears likely to continue the pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens  and operating costs.Since our products will likely be too expensive for most patients to afford without health insurance coverage, if our products are unable to obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement by third-party payors our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates may be adversely impacted. Any limitation on the use of our  products or any decrease in the price of our products will have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve profitability.27In certain foreign countries, pricing, coverage and level of reimbursement of prescription drugs are subject to governmental control, and we may be unable to negotiate coverage, pricing, and reimbursement on terms that are favorable to us. In some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be  lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. Our results of operations may suffer if we are unable to market our products in foreign countries or if coverage and reimbursement for our products in foreign countries is limited.Risks Related to Our Common Stock and our Convertible NotesThe price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile, which also may significantly affect the trading price of our convertible notes.Historically, the market price of our common stock has fluctuated over a wide range, and it is likely that the price of our common stock will continue to be volatile in the future. The market price of our common stock could be impacted due to a variety of factors, including, in addition to global and industry-wide events:                the level of revenues we generate from royalties we receive;    the losses we incur;    the results of preclinical testing and clinical trials by us, our collaborative partners or our competitors;    announcements of technical innovations or new products by us, our collaborative partners or our competitors;    the status of our corporate collaborations and supply arrangements;    regulatory approvals;    developments in patent or other proprietary rights owned or licensed by us, our collaborative partners or our competitors;    public concern as to the safety and efficacy of products developed by us or others; and    litigation.In addition, due to one or more of the foregoing factors in one or more future quarters, our results of operations may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In that event, the market price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected. Volatility in the price of our common stock may  significantly affect the trading price of our convertible notes.Events with respect to our share capital could cause the shares of our common stock outstanding to increase.Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the open market, or the availability of such shares for sale, could adversely affect the price of our common stock. We had 58.8 million shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2010. As of that date, the following securities that may be exercised for, or are  convertible into, shares of our common stock were outstanding:                4% convertible senior notes due 2013 (the 2013 convertible notes). As of December 31, 2010, our 2013 convertible notes could be converted into 14.1 million shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $9.55 per share.    Options. Stock options to purchase 4.0 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of approximately $13.21 per share;    Restricted stock units. Approximately 0.8 million shares of our common stock are issuable in respect of outstanding restricted stock units held by officers, employees and directors.The shares of our common stock that may be issued under the options, restricted stock units, and the 2013 convertible notes are currently registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and, therefore, those shares of common stock that may be issued will be eligible for public resale.28The conversion of some or all of the convertible notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the notes may encourage short  selling by market participants because the conversion of the notes could depress the price of our common stock.Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law may make it more difficult to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders.Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders. These anti-takeover provisions include:                lack of a provision for cumulative voting in the election of directors;    the ability of our board to authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;    advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and    limitations on who may call a special meeting of stockholders.Further, we have in place a stockholder rights plan, commonly known as a poison pill. The provisions described above, our stockholder rights plan and provisions of Delaware law relating to business combinations with interested stockholders may discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us. These provisions may  also discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring a large portion of our securities, or initiating a tender offer, even if our stockholders might receive a premium for their shares in the acquisition over the then current market price. We also have agreements with our executive officers that provide for change of control severance  benefits which provides for cash severance, restricted stock, restricted stock units and option award vesting acceleration and other benefits in the event our employees are terminated (or, in some cases, resign for specified reasons) following an acquisition or other change in control. These agreements could discourage a third party from  acquiring us.The issuance of preferred stock may adversely affect rights of common stockholders.Under our certificate of incorporation, our board of directors has the authority to issue up to three million shares of blank check preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by our stockholders. The rights of the holders of common stock will be  subject to the rights of the holders of any shares of preferred stock that may be issued in the future. In addition to discouraging a takeover, as discussed above, this blank check preferred stock may have rights, including economic rights senior to the common stock, and, as a result, the issuance of such preferred stock could have a  material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock.The market for unrated debt is subject to disruptions that could have an adverse effect on the market price of the 2013 convertible notes, or a market for our notes may fail to develop or be sustained.The 2013 convertible notes are not rated. As a result, holders of the notes have the risks associated with an investment in unrated debt. Historically, the market for unrated debt has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of such securities and greatly reduced liquidity for the holders of such  securities. When the notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending on, among other things, prevailing interest rates, the markets for similar securities, general economic conditions and our financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The liquidity of, and trading markets for, the notes  also may be adversely affected by general declines in the market for unrated debt. Such declines may adversely affect the liquidity of, and trading markets for, the notes, independent of our financial performance or prospects. In addition, certain regulatory restrictions prohibit certain types of financial institutions from investing in unrated  debt, which may further suppress demand for such securities. We cannot assure you that29the market for the notes will not be subject to similar disruptions or that any market for our notes will develop or be sustained. Any such disruptions may have an adverse effect on the holders of the notes.We may not have sufficient funds available to pay amounts due under our 2013 convertible notes.We may not have sufficient funds available or may be unable to arrange for additional financing to satisfy our obligations under our 2013 convertible notes. Our ability to pay cash to holders of the notes or meet our payment and other debt obligations depends on the level of our expenditures and our ability to generate sufficient cash  flow in the future. This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors, as well as other factors that are beyond our control. Also, the indenture governing our 2013 convertible notes does not contain any financial or operating covenants or restrictions on the payments of dividends,  the incurrence of indebtedness or the issuance or repurchase of securities by us or any of our subsidiaries. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our payment obligations under the notes and our other  obligations and to fund other liquidity needs"
2,ENZN,ENZON PHARMACEUTICALS INC,2010-03-12," Risk Factors
Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have made forward-looking statements in an attempt to better enable the reader to understand our future prospects and make informed judgments. By their nature, forward-looking statements are subject to numerous factors that may influence outcomes or even prevent their eventual  realization. Such factors may be external to Enzon and entirely outside our control.We cannot guarantee that our assumptions and expectations will be correct. Failure of events to be achieved or of certain underlying assumptions to prove accurate could cause actual results to vary materially from past results and those anticipated or projected. We do not intend to update forward-looking statements.Certain risks and uncertainties are discussed below. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors, however. Accordingly, you should not consider this recitation to be complete.Risks Relating to Our BusinessWe expect to incur losses over the next several years and may never achieve or sustain profitability.We have limited sources of revenues and we expect to incur losses over the next several years including for the year ending December 31, 2010. We also expect to spend significant amounts to continue research and development of our product candidates and technologies.None of our product candidates have been approved by the FDA and none of them have been commercialized. We do not know when we will have products approved by the FDA or commercialized, if ever. In the absence of revenue from the sale of products or other new sources, our losses will continue as we conduct our research  and development activities.21Development of any successful product candidates is highly uncertain due to the extended testing and regulatory review process required before marketing clearance can be obtained and failure to develop, obtain regulatory approval and commercialize our product candidates could materially harm our business.There is a high risk of failure for pharmaceutical product candidates. Only a small minority of all research and development programs ultimately result in commercially successful drugs. We may never succeed in developing an approved drug. Further, due to the extended testing and regulatory review process required before  marketing clearance can be obtained, the time periods before commercialization of any of these products are long and uncertain. Risks during development and commercialization include the possibility that: any or all of our product candidates will be found to be ineffective; our product candidates will have adverse side effects or will  otherwise fail to receive the necessary regulatory approvals; our product candidates may be effective but uneconomical to manufacture or market; or our competitors may market equivalent or superior products.The risk of failure is increased for our product candidates that are based on new technologies or approaches to the development of therapeutics. For example, the LNA technology is a novel technology and there are currently no approved drugs, or even late-stage drug candidates, employing this technology. Product candidates  employing these technologies may not advance to pivotal stages of product development or demonstrate clinical safety or efficacy. If we do not succeed in the development of these product candidates, or if our technologies fail to generate products, our business could be materially harmed.From time to time, we may establish and announce certain development goals for our product candidates and programs; however, given the complex nature of the drug discovery and development process, it is difficult to predict accurately if and when we will achieve these goals. If we are unsuccessful in advancing our preclinical  programs into clinical testing, advancing our clinical programs into later clinical phases, or in obtaining regulatory approval, our business prospects may be harmed.We do not expect any of the drugs resulting from our current research and development efforts to be commercially available for several years, if at all. In order to fill our pipeline of product candidates under development, we may attempt to acquire rights to products under development by other companies. The competition for the  acquisition of rights to products that are viewed as viable candidates for successful development and commercialization is intense, and we will be competing for such opportunities with many companies with resources that are substantially greater than ours.Our financial results are heavily dependent on the continued sales of PEGINTRON on which we receive royalties; if revenues from these royalties materially decline, our results of operations and financial position could be materially harmed.Our results of operations are heavily dependent on the royalty revenues we receive on the sale of PEGINTRON, marketed by Merck. As a consequence, a decline in the sales of PEGINTRON could adversely affect our operating results and financial position. We cannot assure you that Merck will continue to be successful in  marketing PEGINTRON. The amount and timing of resources dedicated by Merck to the marketing of PEGINTRON is not within our control. Our royalty revenues will be negatively affected if sales of PEGINTRON are limited for any reason, including if Merck cannot market PEGINTRON as a result of manufacturing, regulatory or  other issues.Products that compete with PEGINTRON have been and potentially will be introduced by other drug manufacturers. Hoffmann-La Roches Pegasys, a competing PEGylated interferon-based combination therapy, has resulted in significant competitive pressure on PEGINTRON sales in the U.S. and all international markets. Pegasys  has taken market share away from PEGINTRON and the overall market for PEGylated alpha-interferon for the treatment of hepatitis C has been contracting. As a result, sales of PEGINTRON in certain markets where it competes with Pegasys and the royalties we receive on those sales have declined. We cannot assure you that Pegasys  will not continue to gain market share at the expense of PEGINTRON which could result in lower PEGINTRON sales and lower royalties to us.22We may require additional financing to meet our future capital needs and failure to obtain such funding could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operations.Our research and development projects require substantial capital. We will continue to expend substantial resources for research and development, including costs associated with developing our product candidates and conducting clinical trials. We believe that our current cash and investments will be adequate to satisfy our capital  needs for the near future, but we have limited sources of revenue and we may require additional financing to meet our future capital needs.We may require substantial additional capital to:                fund research and development activities;    conduct pre-clinical studies and clinical trials; and    undertake other activities relating to the successful development of product candidates.Our future capital needs depend on many factors, including:                the scope, duration and expenditures associated with our research and development programs;    continued scientific progress in these programs;    the outcome of potential licensing transactions, if any;    competing technological developments;    our proprietary patent position in our products; and    the regulatory approval process for our product candidates.We may seek to raise necessary funds through public or private equity offerings, debt financings or additional strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. Any additional equity financings may be on terms that are dilutive or potentially dilutive to our stockholders. Any debt financing we enter into may involve incurring significant  interest expense and include covenants that restrict our operations. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. General market conditions may make it difficult for us to seek financing from the capital markets. We may be required to relinquish rights to our technologies or drug candidates, or grant  licenses on terms that are not favorable to us, to raise additional funds through alliance, joint venture or licensing arrangements. If adequate funds are not available, we may have to delay, reduce or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs and reduce overall overhead expenses. These actions could have a material  adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operations.We depend on our collaborative partners; if we lose our collaborative partners or they do not apply adequate resources to our collaborations, our product development and financial performance may suffer.We rely and will depend heavily in the future on collaborations with partners, primarily pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, for one or more of the research, development, manufacturing, marketing and other commercialization activities relating to most of our product candidates. In particular, we depend on Santaris for  development of additional LNA compounds. If we lose our collaborative partners, or if they do not apply adequate resources to our collaborations, our product development and financial performance may suffer.The amount and timing of resources dedicated by our collaborators to their collaborations with us are not within our control. If any collaborator breaches or terminates its agreements with us or fails to conduct its collaborative activities in a timely manner, the commercialization of our product candidates could be slowed or blocked  completely. For example, Santaris can terminate its agreement with respect to a specific LNA compound provided by Santaris if we do not achieve certain development milestones for that compound. In addition, our collaborative partners may change their strategic focus, pursue alternative technologies or develop alternative products as a  means for developing treatments for the diseases targeted by these collaborative programs and these could compete with products we are developing.Further, our collaborations may not be successful. Disputes may arise between us and our collaborators as to a variety of matters, including financing obligations under our agreements and ownership of intellectual property rights. These disputes may be both expensive and time-consuming and may result in delays in the23development and commercialization of products. If any of the product candidates that we are commercializing with collaborators are delayed or blocked from entering the market or we experience increased costs as a result of our relationship with our collaborators, our financial performance could be adversely affected.We purchase some of the compounds utilized in our product candidates from a single source or a limited group of suppliers, and the partial or complete loss of one of these suppliers could cause production delays and a substantial loss of revenues.We purchase the unmodified pharmaceutical compounds, bulk PEGs and other compounds used to manufacture our product candidates from outside suppliers. In some cases, we have a limited number of suppliers.Our reliance on our suppliers exposes us to significant risks. These third parties might:                be unable or unwilling to provide us with sufficient materials to meet our demands;    fail to meet our standards of quality or other specifications;    increase significantly the prices they charge us for materials; or    not carry out their contractual duties or meet anticipated deadlines, which could result in delays in obtaining or maintaining regulatory approvals.If our suppliers are unwilling or unable to timely supply us with materials meeting our specifications, we may not be able to locate any alternative suppliers or enter into commercially reasonable agreements with suppliers in a timely manner or at all. In addition, we may be unable to find alternative suppliers with appropriate  regulatory authorizations. If we experience a delay in obtaining or are unable to obtain any compound for the manufacture of our product candidates on reasonable terms, or at all, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our product candidates must undergo extensive clinical testing, the results of which are highly uncertain and could substantially delay or prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval.Before we can market a product, we must obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate. To obtain regulatory approval, we must undertake extensive clinical testing in humans to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities for each indication. The pre-clinical testing  and clinical trials for any product candidates that we develop must comply with the regulations of numerous federal, state and local government authorities in the U.S., principally the FDA, and those of similar agencies in other countries. Clinical trials of new product candidates sufficient to obtain regulatory marketing approval are  expensive and take years to complete.Even though they consume substantial resources, the outcome of these trials is highly uncertain. Safety and efficacy results from pre-clinical studies involving animals and other models and from early clinical trials are often not accurate indicators of results of later-stage clinical trials that involve larger human populations, and,  moreover, may not always be representative of results obtained while marketing an approved drug, particularly with regard to safety. In addition, we may suffer significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after achieving promising results in earlier trials. For example, Phase II activity may not replicate Phase I results or Phase III efficacy  data may not replicate Phase II data. Any adverse results from studies, including clinical trials, could have a negative effect on our ability to obtain the approval of the FDA or other regulatory agencies. Unfavorable results of clinical trials conducted by our competitors or other biotechnology companies could also adversely affect our  ability to gain regulatory approval of our product candidates by increasing government examination and complexity of clinical trials. Government and public concerns over safety issues associated with pharmaceutical and biological products could potentially result in termination of clinical trials on entire classes of drug candidates,  lengthen the trial process for product categories, increase legal and production costs relating to certain drug categories, and/or expand the safety labeling for approved products.Clinical development of any product candidate that we decide to take into clinical trials may be delayed or prevented at any time for some or all of the following reasons:                negative or ambiguous results regarding the efficacy of the product candidate;24    undesirable side effects that delay or extend the trials or make the product candidate not medically or commercially viable;    inability to recruit and qualify a sufficient number of patients for our trials;    regulatory delays or other regulatory actions, including changes in regulatory requirements;    difficulties in obtaining sufficient quantities of the product candidate manufactured under current good manufacturing practices;    delays, suspension or termination of the trials imposed by us, an independent institutional review board for a clinical trial site, or clinical holds placed upon the trials by the FDA; and    our failure to obtain adequate financial resources to fund these trials.We depend on third parties to conduct the clinical trials for our product candidates and any failure of those parties to fulfill their obligations could harm our development and commercialization plans.We depend on independent clinical investigators, contract research organizations, academic institutions and other third-party service providers to conduct clinical trials for our product candidates. Though we rely heavily on these parties for successful execution of our clinical trials, we are ultimately responsible for the results of their  activities and many aspects of their activities are beyond our control. For example, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial, but the independent clinical investigators may prioritize other projects over ours or may fail to timely  communicate issues regarding our products to us. Third parties may not complete activities on schedule or may not conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols. The early termination of any of our clinical trial arrangements, the failure of third parties to comply with the regulations and  requirements governing clinical trials or our reliance on results of trials that we have not directly conducted or monitored could hinder or delay the development, approval and commercialization of our product candidates and would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.If our clinical trials are not successful, if we experience significant delays in these trials, or if we do not complete our clinical trials, we may not be able to commercialize our product candidates, which would materially harm our business.We depend on patents and proprietary rights, which may offer only limited protection against potential infringement and the development of competing products.The pharmaceutical industry places considerable importance on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for new technologies, products and processes. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to develop and maintain a strong patent position for our product candidates and technologies both in the U.S. and in other countries and  to protect our proprietary rights. If we are unable to obtain and enforce patent protection for our product candidates or to maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets, our business could be materially harmed. We have an extensive portfolio of issued U.S. patents and filed applications, many of which have foreign counterparts. In  addition, under our license agreements, we have exclusively licensed patents related to our HIF-1 alpha antagonist, Survivin antagonist and our other LNA compounds in development. Although we believe that our patents provide certain protection from competition, such patents may not provide substantial protection or commercial  benefit to us, or afford us adequate protection from competing products, and may be challenged or declared invalid. In addition, U.S. patents or foreign patent equivalents may not be issued to us in the future.Issued patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. In addition, court decisions may introduce uncertainty as to the enforceability or scope of patents owned by biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including us. The legal systems of certain countries do not favor the aggressive enforcement of patents, and the  laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. Therefore, enforceability or scope of our patents in the U.S. or in foreign countries cannot be predicted with certainty, and, as a result, any patents that we own or license may not provide sufficient protection against competitors. In25addition, we may not be able to obtain or maintain a patent from our pending patent applications, those we may file in the future, or those we may license from third parties.We believe that our patent rights are enforceable; however, those rights may prove unenforceable or invalid, or may expire prior to the commercialization of our product candidates, thus allowing others to more effectively compete with us. Therefore, any patents that we own or license may not adequately protect our product  candidates or our future products. If we are not able to protect our patent positions, our business and financial condition could be materially harmed. We may become aware that certain organizations are engaging in activities that infringe certain of our patents, including our PEGylation technology patents. We may be unable to enforce  our patents and other rights against such organizations.Legal or administrative proceedings may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to defend against claims of infringement. We have in the past been involved in patent litigation and other proceedings and we may likely become involved in additional patent litigation or proceedings in the future. If we become  involved in any such litigation or proceeding, irrespective of the outcome, we may incur substantial costs, the efforts of our technical and management personnel may be diverted, and such disputes could substantially delay or prevent our product development or commercialization activities, which could materially harm our business,  financial condition and results of operations.Blocking patents or claims of infringement may stop or delay the development of our proprietary products.Other entities may have or obtain proprietary rights that could impair our competitive position. Our commercial success depends in part on avoiding claims of infringement of the patents or proprietary rights of such third parties. Although we investigate the patent protection surrounding our technology and product candidates, there  are numerous patents, each with multiple claims, which makes it difficult to uncover and interpret the extent of patent protection which can lead to uncertainty about our freedom to operate. It is possible that we will not be aware of issued patents or pending patent applications that are relevant to our product candidates because our  searches do not find them or because they are not yet publicly available. Our interpretation of patents could be challenged, leading to litigation, and we could face claims of infringement of rights of which we are unaware.There have been significant litigation and interference proceedings regarding patent rights, and the patent situation regarding particular products is often complex and uncertain. As we proceed with the development of our product candidates, we may face uncertainty and litigation could result, which could lead to liability for  damages, prevent our development and commercialization efforts and divert resources from our business strategy.Third parties from time to time may assert that we are infringing their patents, trade secrets or know-how. In addition, our technology may infringe patents that may issue in the future to third parties. We could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves and our partners against any such claims. Furthermore, parties making such  claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability or our partners ability to further develop or commercialize some or all of our products or technology in the U.S. and abroad, and could result in the award of substantial damages. If we are found to infringe, we may be required to  obtain one or more licenses from third parties or be unable to proceed with development or commercialization of our product candidates. We may not be able to obtain such licenses at a reasonable cost, if at all. Defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any such required license could have a material adverse effect on us.We may have to develop or license alternative technologies if we are unable to obtain key technology from third parties or maintain our rights to technology we license from third parties.We have licensed patents and patent applications from Santaris under our collaboration and license agreement with them. Some of our proprietary rights have been licensed to us under agreements that have performance requirements or other contingencies. The failure to comply with these provisions could lead to termination or  modifications of our rights to these licenses. Additionally, we may need to obtain additional licenses to patents or other proprietary rights from other parties to facilitate development of our proprietary26technology base. The ownership of patents exclusively licensed to us may be subject to challenge if inventorship was not adequately investigated and represented. If our existing licenses are terminated or if we are unable to obtain such additional licenses on acceptable terms, our ability to perform our own research and development and  to comply with our obligations under our collaborative agreements may be delayed while we seek to develop or license alternative technologies.The patents upon which our original PEGylation technology was based have expired and, as a result, the scope of our patent protection is narrower.The U.S and corresponding foreign patents upon which our original PEGylation technology was based expired in 1996. Without that patent protection, other parties are permitted to make, use or sell products covered by the claims of those patents, subject to other patents, including those which we hold. We have obtained numerous  patents with claims covering improved methods of attaching or linking PEG to therapeutic compounds. However, these patents may not enable us to prevent competition or competitors may develop alternative methods of attaching PEG to compounds potentially resulting in competitive products outside the protection that may be afforded  by our patents. We are aware that others have also filed patent applications and have been granted patents in the U.S. and other countries with respect to the application of PEG to proteins and other compounds.The manufacture of our product candidates is a complex and highly-regulated process and we rely on third-party manufacturers to manufacture materials for us. If any of them fails to meet regulatory requirements, our business could suffer.The FDA and foreign and state regulators require manufacturers to register manufacturing facilities. The FDA and these regulators also inspect these facilities to confirm compliance with current good manufacturing practices or similar requirements that the FDA and these regulators establish. The manufacture of product candidates  and key reagents at any facility is subject to strict quality control, testing, and record keeping requirements, and continuing obligations regarding the submission of safety reports and other post-market information. Ultimately, we, our third-party manufacturers, our licensees, or other suppliers may not meet these requirements. Our third-  party manufacturers may face manufacturing or quality control problems causing product production and shipment delays or a situation where we or they may not be able to maintain compliance with the FDAs current good manufacturing practices requirements or those of foreign or state regulators, necessary to continue manufacturing  our product candidates and materials. Any failure to comply with current good manufacturing practices requirements or other FDA and foreign or state regulatory requirements could adversely affect our clinical research activities and our ability to market and develop our products candidates.We may be subject to a variety of types of product liability or other claims based on allegations that the use of our product candidates by participants in our clinical trials has resulted in adverse effects, and our insurance may not cover all product liability or other claims.We may face liability claims related to the use or misuse of our product candidates in clinical trials. These claims may be expensive to defend and may result in large judgments against us. Generally, our clinical trials are conducted in patients with serious life-threatening diseases for whom conventional treatments have been  unsuccessful and during the course of treatment these patients could suffer adverse medical effects or die for reasons that may or may not be related to our product candidates. Any of these events could result in a claim of liability. Any such claims against us, regardless of their merit, could result in significant costs to defend or awards  against us that could materially harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.Although we maintain product liability insurance for claims arising from the use of our product candidates in clinical trials prior to FDA approval and for claims arising from the use of our products after FDA approval at levels that we believe are appropriate, we may not be able to maintain our existing insurance coverage or obtain  additional coverage on commercially reasonable terms for the use of our other product candidates and products in the future. Also, our insurance coverage and resources may not be sufficient to satisfy any liability27resulting from product liability claims which could materially harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.We depend on key personnel and may not be able to retain these employees or recruit additional qualified personnel, which would harm our business; our chief executive officer recently resigned and we currently do not have a chief executive officer.Because of the specialized scientific nature of our business, we are highly dependent upon qualified research and development scientists, technical and managerial personnel, including our President of Research and Development. There is intense competition for qualified personnel in the pharmaceutical field. Therefore, we may not  be able to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business. Although we have an employment agreement with our President of Research and Development, our ability to continue to retain him, as well as other senior executives or key managers is not assured.Effective February 22, 2010, Jeffrey Buchalter resigned as our President and Chief Executive Officer. Our board of directors established an executive committee to serve as a search committee for a new Chief Executive Officer. On February 22, 2010, the executive committee appointed Ralph del Campo as our Chief Operating  Officer and designated him as Principal Executive Officer and Dr. Ivan Horak as President of Research and Development. Mr. del Campo had been serving as our Executive Vice President, Technical Operations and Dr. Horak had been serving as our Executive Vice President, Research and Development and Chief Scientific Officer.  However, we currently do not have a Chief Executive Officer.The loss of the services of one or a combination of our senior executives, particularly our President of Research and Development, as well as the failure to recruit additional key research and development scientists, technical and managerial personnel, particularly a new chief executive officer, in a timely manner, could have an  adverse effect on our business.Risks Relating to Our IndustrySignificant competition for our technology platforms and product candidates could make our technologies or product candidates obsolete or uncompetitive, which would negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by extensive research and development effort, and rapid technological change. Our future success will depend on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to technological advances. Rapid technological development by others may result in our product candidates and  technologies becoming obsolete. We face intense competition from established biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, as well as academic and research institutions that are pursuing competing technologies and products. We know that competitors are developing or manufacturing various platform technologies and products that are  used for the prevention, diagnosis or treatment of diseases that we have targeted for product development. Current and prospective competing products may provide greater therapeutic benefits for a specific problem or may offer comparable performance at a lower cost when compared to our product candidates. In addition, any product  candidate that we develop and that obtains regulatory approval must then compete for market acceptance and market share.Our competitors in the PEGylation technology field include The Dow Chemical Company, Nektar Pharmaceuticals, Inc., SunBio Corporation, Mountain View Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Neose Technologies, Inc., NOF Corporation and Urigen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Several other chemical, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  may also be developing PEGylation technologies. Some of these companies license or provide the technology to other companies, while others develop the technology for internal use.Other companies are conducting research and developing products utilizing technologies targeting RNA (e.g. antisense, siRNA/RNAi or micro RNA) that compete with the LNA technology. These include Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc., Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Regulus Therapeutics LLC, Eli Lilly and Company and others. In  addition, there are a number of existing therapeutic regimens designed to treat the cancers that we may target with the HIF-1 alpha antagonist. However, we are not of aware of any development of another compound that would have a mechanism similar to our HIF-1 alpha antagonist. There are a number of drugs in28various stages of preclinical and clinical development from companies exploring cancer therapies or improved chemotherapeutic agents to potentially treat the same cancer indications that our PEG-SN38 may be developed to treat. Additionally, there are a number of drugs in development based on the active metabolite SN38. If these  drugs are approved, they could compete directly with our PEG-SN38. These include products in development from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Pfizer Inc., GlaxoSmithKline p/c, Antigenics Inc., Hoffman-La Roche Ltd., Novartis AG, Cell Therapeutics, Inc., Neopharm, Inc., Meditech Research Limited and others. Nektar  Therapeutics is also developing a PEGylated form of irinotecan. Irinotecan is a prodrug of SN38. This product candidate is currently in Phase II for colorectal cancer. Nektar has also commenced trials in breast and ovarian cancer for this product candidate.Many of our competitors have substantially greater research and development capabilities and experience and greater manufacturing, marketing and financial resources than we do. In addition, many of our competitors have much more experience than we do in pre-clinical testing and human clinical trials of new drugs, as well as in  obtaining FDA and other regulatory approval. We face competition from these companies not just in product development but also in areas such as recruiting employees, acquiring technologies that might enhance our ability to commercialize products, establishing relationships with certain research and academic institutions, enrolling  patients in clinical trials and seeking program partnerships and collaborations with larger pharmaceutical companies. Accordingly, our competitors may develop technologies and products that are superior to those we or our collaborators are developing and render our technologies and products or those of our collaborators obsolete and  noncompetitive. If we cannot compete effectively, our business and financial performance would suffer.The regulatory approval process is highly uncertain and we will not be allowed to market products if regulatory approval has not been obtained.The marketing of pharmaceutical products in the U.S. and abroad is subject to stringent governmental regulation. The sale of any new products for use in humans in the U.S. requires the prior approval of the FDA. If our products are marketed abroad, they will also be subject to extensive regulation by foreign governments, whether  or not we have obtained FDA approval for a given product and its indications. The FDA has established mandatory procedures and safety standards that apply to the clinical testing and marketing of pharmaceutical products. The FDA regulates the research, development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness,  record-keeping, reporting, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale, distribution, import and export of pharmaceutical and biological products. Obtaining FDA approval for a new therapeutic product may take many years and involve substantial expenditures. Compliance with these regulations can be costly, time-consuming  and subject us to unanticipated delays in developing our products. Neither we nor our licensees may be able to obtain or maintain FDA or other relevant marketing approval for any of our products.There may be limitations placed on our ability to successfully market our products by the FDA or foreign regulators.Regulatory approval may:                limit the indicated uses for a product;    otherwise limit our ability to promote, sell and distribute the product;    require that we conduct costly post-marketing surveillance; and    require that we conduct ongoing post-marketing studies. Material changes to an approved product, such as manufacturing changes or revised labeling, may require further regulatory review and approval. Once obtained, any approvals may be withdrawn for a number of reasons, including the later discovery of previously unknown      problems with the product, such as a safety issue. If we or our third-party manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements at any stage during the regulatory process, such noncompliance could result in:                refusals or delays in the approval of applications or supplements to approved applications;    refusal of a regulatory authority, including the FDA, to review pending market approval applications or supplements to approved applications;29    warning letters;    import or export restrictions;    product recalls or seizures;    injunctions;    total or partial suspension of production;    fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecutions; and    withdrawals of previously approved marketing applications or licenses.In addition, any approved products are subject to continuing regulation. Among other things, the holder of an approved biologic license application or new drug application is subject to periodic and other FDA monitoring and reporting obligations, including obligations to monitor and report adverse events and instances of the failure  of a product to meet the specifications in the biologic license application or new drug application. Application holders must also submit advertising and other promotional material to the FDA and report on ongoing clinical trials. Failure to meet these post-approval requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties,  injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, or denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals.Even if we are granted regulatory approval in one jurisdiction, we may not receive regulatory approval in another jurisdiction.Failure to obtain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions would prevent us from marketing our products abroad. In order to market our products in the European Union and many other jurisdictions outside the U.S., we must obtain separate regulatory approvals and comply with numerous foreign regulatory requirements. The  approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. The foreign regulatory approval process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. We may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a  timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA. We may not be able to file for regulatory approvals and may not receive necessary  approvals to commercialize our products in any market. The failure to obtain these approvals could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.If we or our licensees fail to obtain or maintain requisite governmental approvals or fail to obtain or maintain approvals of the scope requested, it will delay or preclude us or our licensees or marketing partners from marketing our products. It could also limit the commercial use of our products. Any such failure or limitation may  have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Once approved, our products may not be accepted in the marketplace.Even if clinical trials demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates and all regulatory approvals are obtained, the commercial success of our products depends on gaining market acceptance among physicians, patients, third-party payors or the medical community. The degree of market acceptance will depend on many  factors, including:                the scope of regulatory approvals, including limitations or warnings contained in a products regulatory-approved labeling;    establishment and demonstration of clinical efficacy and safety;    cost-effectiveness of our products;    alternative treatment methods and potentially competitive products; and    the availability of third-party reimbursement.30Market acceptance could be further limited depending on the prevalence and severity of any expected or unexpected adverse side effects associated with our product candidates. If our product candidates are approved but do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, third-party payors and patients, we may never  generate significant revenue from these products, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially harmed.Our operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations.Our operations are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous, toxic and radioactive substances and the discharge of pollutants into the air and water. Environmental permits and controls are  required for some of our operations and these permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation by the issuing authorities. If we were to become liable for an accident, or if we were to suffer an extended facility shutdown as a result of such contamination, we could incur significant costs, damages and penalties that could harm  our business and exceed our resources or insurance coverage.The successful commercialization of our product candidates will depend on obtaining health insurance coverage and reimbursement for use of these products from third-party payors and these payors may not agree to cover or reimburse for use of our products.Our future revenues and profitability will be adversely affected if U.S. and foreign governmental, private third-party insurers and payors, and other third-party payors, including Medicare and Medicaid, do not agree to defray or reimburse the cost of our products to the patients. If these entities refuse to provide coverage and  reimbursement with respect to our products or provide an insufficient level of coverage and reimbursement, our products may be too costly for many patients to afford them, and physicians may not prescribe them. In addition, the limitation on the amount of reimbursement for our products may also reduce our profitability. In the U.S.,  there have been, and we expect will continue to be, actions and proposals to control and reduce healthcare costs. Government and other third-party payors are challenging the prices charged for healthcare products and increasingly limiting, and attempting to limit, both coverage and level of reimbursement for prescription drugs.Since our products will likely be too expensive for most patients to afford without health insurance coverage, if our products are unable to obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement by third-party payors our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates may be adversely impacted. Any limitation on the use of our  products or any decrease in the price of our products will have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve profitability.In certain foreign countries, pricing, coverage and level of reimbursement of prescription drugs are subject to governmental control, and we may be unable to negotiate coverage, pricing, and reimbursement on terms that are favorable to us. In some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be  lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. Our results of operations may suffer if we are unable to market our products in foreign countries or if coverage and reimbursement for our products in foreign countries is limited.Risks Related to Our Common Stock and our Convertible NotesThe price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile, which also may significantly affect the trading price of our convertible notes.Historically, the market price of our common stock has fluctuated over a wide range, and it is likely that the price of our common stock will continue to be volatile in the future. The market price of our common stock could be impacted due to a variety of factors, including, in addition to global and industry-wide events:                the level of revenues we generate from royalties we receive;    the losses we incur;    the results of preclinical testing and clinical trials by us, our collaborative partners or our competitors;31    announcements of technical innovations or new products by us, our collaborative partners or our competitors;    the status of our corporate collaborations and supply arrangements;    regulatory approvals;    developments in patent or other proprietary rights owned or licensed by us, our collaborative partners or our competitors;    public concern as to the safety and efficacy of products developed by us or others; and    litigation.In addition, due to one or more of the foregoing factors in one or more future quarters, our results of operations may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In that event, the market price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected. Volatility in the price of our common stock may  significantly affect the trading price of our convertible notes.Events with respect to our share capital could cause the shares of our common stock outstanding to increase.Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the open market, or the availability of such shares for sale, could adversely affect the price of our common stock. We had approximately 45 million shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2009. As of that date, the following securities that may be exercised for, or  are convertible into, shares of our common stock were outstanding:                Options. Stock options to purchase 8.4 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of approximately $10.99 per share;    4%        convertible senior notes due 2013 (the 2013 convertible notes).        As of December 31, 2009, our 2013 convertible notes could be converted        into 26.2 million shares of our common stock at a conversion price of        $9.55 per share. The sale of our specialty pharmaceutical business in        January 2010 constituted a fundamental change under the indenture agreement        for the 2013 convertible notes, which triggered a requirement that we        offer to purchase all of the 2013 convertible notes at face value. Accordingly,        the note holders had the option of retaining the notes, tendering the        notes to us at face value, or converting the notes into shares of our        common stock at an enhanced conversion rate as defined in the notes indenture        instrument. The offer to repurchase was commenced on February 5, 2010        and expired on March 5, 2010 with no notes having been tendered. During        the enhanced conversion period of January 29, 2010 to March 4, 2010,        $115.6 million principal amount of notes were converted into approximately        13.5 million shares of our common stock, reducing the principal balance        of notes outstanding to $134.5 million. Subsequent to the enhanced conversion        period, the original conversion rate of 104.712 shares per $1,000 principal        amount of notes is again in effect potentially resulting in the issuance        of 14.1 million shares of common stock if the remaining notes were to        be converted.    Restricted        stock units. 0.8 million shares of our common stock issuable in respect        of outstanding restricted stock units held by officers, employees and        directors. As of March 9, 2010, restricted stock units outstanding may        be reduced to 0.3 million primarily as a result of accelerated vesting        in connection with the sale of our specialty pharmaceutical business        and, subject to certain conditions, the resignation of our chief executive        officer.The shares of our common stock that may be issued under the options, restricted stock units, and the 2013 convertible notes are currently registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and, therefore, those shares of common stock that may be issued will be eligible for public resale.The conversion of some or all of the convertible notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the notes may encourage short  selling by market participants because the conversion of the notes could depress the price of our common stock.32Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law may make it more difficult to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders.Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders. These anti-takeover provisions include:                a classified board of directors whereby not all members of the board may be elected at one time;    lack of a provision for cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates;    the ability of our board to authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;    advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and    limitations on who may call a special meeting of stockholders.Further, we have in place a stockholder rights plan, commonly known as a poison pill. The provisions described above, our stockholder rights plan and provisions of Delaware law relating to business combinations with interested stockholders may discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us. These provisions may  also discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring a large portion of our securities, or initiating a tender offer, even if our stockholders might receive a premium for their shares in the acquisition over the then current market price. We also have agreements with our executive officers that provide for change of control severance  benefits which provides for cash severance, restricted stock, restricted stock unit and option award vesting acceleration and other benefits in the event our employees are terminated (or, in some cases, resign for specified reasons) following an acquisition or other change in control. These agreements could discourage a third party from  acquiring us.The issuance of preferred stock may adversely affect rights of common stockholders.Under our certificate of incorporation, our board of directors has the authority to issue up to three million shares of blank check preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by our stockholders. The rights of the holders of common stock will be  subject to the rights of the holders of any shares of preferred stock that may be issued in the future. In addition to discouraging a takeover, as discussed above, this blank check preferred stock may have rights, including economic rights senior to the common stock, and, as a result, the issuance of such preferred stock could have a  material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock.The market for unrated debt is subject to disruptions that could have an adverse effect on the market price of the 2013 convertible notes, or a market for our notes may fail to develop or be sustained.The 2013 convertible notes are not rated. As a result, holders of the notes have the risks associated with an investment in unrated debt. Historically, the market for unrated debt has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of such securities and greatly reduced liquidity for the holders of such  securities. If the notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending on, among other things, prevailing interest rates, the markets for similar securities, general economic conditions and our financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The liquidity of, and trading markets for, the notes also  may be adversely affected by general declines in the market for unrated debt. Such declines may adversely affect the liquidity of, and trading markets for, the notes, independent of our financial performance or prospects. In addition, certain regulatory restrictions prohibit certain types of financial institutions from investing in unrated debt,  which may further suppress demand for such securities. We cannot assure you that the market for the notes will not be subject to similar disruptions or that any market for our notes will develop or be sustained. Any such disruptions may have an adverse effect on the holders of the notes.33We may not have sufficient funds available to pay amounts due under our 2013 convertible notes.We may not have sufficient funds available or may be unable to arrange for additional financing to satisfy our obligations under our 2013 convertible notes. Our ability to pay cash to holders of the notes or meet our payment and other debt obligations depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future. This, to  some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors, as well as other factors that are beyond our control. Also, the indenture governing our 2013 convertible notes does not contain any financial or operating covenants or restrictions on the payments of dividends, the incurrence of  indebtedness or the issuance or repurchase of securities by us or any of our subsidiaries. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our payment obligations under the notes and our other obligations and to  fund other liquidity needs"
0,ENZN,ENZON PHARMACEUTICALS INC,2009-03-09," Risk Factors
Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have made forward-looking statements in an attempt to better enable the reader to understand our future prospects and make informed judgments. By their nature, forward-looking statements are subject to numerous factors that may influence outcomes or even prevent their eventual  realization. Such factors may be external to Enzon and entirely outside our control.We cannot guarantee that our assumptions and expectations will be correct. Failure of events to be achieved or of certain underlying assumptions to prove accurate could cause actual results to vary materially from past results and those anticipated or projected. We do not intend to update forward-looking statements.Certain risks and uncertainties are discussed below. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors, however. Accordingly, you should not consider this recitation to be complete.Risks Related to Our BusinessIf any of these risks are realized our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and our ability to service debt could be materially adversely affected.We expect to incur losses over the next several years.As of December 31, 2008, we had an accumulated deficit of $302.2 million. We expect to incur losses over the next several years, including for the year ending December 31, 2009, as we expect to make significant research and development expenditures.Our ability to achieve long-term profitability will depend primarily on:                the success of our research and development programs;24    the continued sales of our marketed products and the products on which we receive royalties; and    our and our licensees ability to develop and obtain regulatory approvals for additional product candidates.Development of any successful product candidates is highly uncertain due to the extended testing and regulatory review process required before marketing clearance can be obtained and failure to develop, obtain regulatory approval and commercialize our product candidates could materially harm our business.There is a high risk of failure for pharmaceutical product candidates. Only a small minority of all research and development programs ultimately result in commercially successful drugs. We may never succeed in developing an approved drug. Further, due to the extended testing and regulatory review process required before  marketing clearance can be obtained, the time periods before commercialization of any of these products are long and uncertain. Risks during development and commercialization include the possibility that:                any or all of our product candidates will be found to be ineffective;    our product candidates will have adverse side effects or will otherwise fail to receive the necessary regulatory approvals;    our product candidates may be effective but uneconomical to manufacture or market; or    our competitors may market equivalent or superior products.The risk of failure is increased for our product candidates that are based on new technologies or approaches to the development of therapeutics. For example, the LNA technology is a novel technology and there are currently no approved drugs, or even late-stage drug candidates, employing this technology. Product candidates  employing these technologies may not advance to pivotal stages of product development or demonstrate clinical safety or efficacy. If we do not succeed in the development of these product candidates, or if our technologies fail to generate products, our business could be materially harmed.At the present time, the vast majority of our research and development operations are focused on the early stages of product research and development, and we are conducting or first commencing clinical trials on our product candidates. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not necessarily predict success in later  clinical trials. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in later-stage clinical trials due to such factors as inconclusive results and adverse medical events, even after achieving positive results in earlier trials. If our product candidates fail in the clinical trial stage, it could  materially harm our business prospects.From time to time, we may establish and announce certain development goals for our product candidates and programs; however, given the complex nature of the drug discovery and development process, it is difficult to predict accurately if and when we will achieve these goals. If we are unsuccessful in advancing our preclinical  programs into clinical testing or in obtaining regulatory approval, our business prospects may be harmed.We do not expect any of the drugs resulting from our current research and development efforts to be commercially available for several years, if at all. In order to fill our pipeline of product candidates under development, we may attempt to acquire rights to products under development by other companies. The competition for the  acquisition of rights to products that are viewed as viable candidates for successful development and commercialization is intense, and we will be competing for such opportunities with many companies with resources that are substantially greater than ours.As an example, we recently discontinued our Phase Ib clinical trials for our rhMBL product candidate. These trials did not produce results that would support advancing the compound to further clinical trials.25Our financial results are heavily dependent on the continued sales of our marketed products and the products on which we receive royalties; if revenues from these products fail to increase or materially decline, our results of operations, financial position and prospects could be materially harmed.Our results of operations are heavily dependent on the revenues we derive from the sale and marketing of our products Oncaspar, DepoCyt, Abelcet and Adagen as well as the royalty revenues we receive on the sale of PEG-INTRON, marketed by Schering-Plough. As a consequence of the significance of these products to us,  stagnation or decline in the sales of one or more of them could adversely affect our operating results, financial position and prospects.Sales of our products can be affected by, among other things, competition, patient demand and manufacturing issues. We cannot assure you that Schering-Plough will continue to be successful in marketing PEG-INTRON. The amount and timing of resources dedicated by Schering-Plough to the marketing of PEG-INTRON is not  within our control. Our royalty revenues will be negatively affected if sales of PEG-INTRON are limited for any reason, including if Schering-Plough cannot market PEG-INTRON as a result of manufacturing, regulatory or other issues.Sales of PEG-INTRON and Abelcet have been adversely affected by competitive products introduced into their respective markets and we have experienced in the past and may continue to experience in the future a decline in sales of Abelcet, which if not reversed, will adversely affect our results of operations,  financial condition and prospects.Products that compete with both PEG-INTRON and Abelcet have been and potentially will be introduced by other drug manufacturers into their respective markets.Hoffmann-La Roches Pegasys, a competing PEGylated interferon-based combination therapy, has resulted in significant competitive pressure on PEG-INTRON sales in the U.S. and all international markets. Pegasys has taken market share away from PEG-INTRON and the overall market for PEGylated alpha-interferon for the  treatment of hepatitis C has been contracting. As a result, sales of PEG-INTRON in certain markets where it competes with Pegasys and the royalties we receive on those sales have declined. We cannot assure you that Pegasys will not continue to gain market share at the expense of PEG-INTRON which could result in lower PEG-  INTRON sales and lower royalties to us. While we receive a royalty on sales of Pegasys under our Nektar agreement, it is a smaller royalty than that received on sales of PEG-INTRON and our royalties on Pegasys end in October 2009.Similarly, the continued sale of newer products from Merck, Pfizer, Schering-Plough and Astellas Pharma in the antifungal market (where Abelcet competes) has negatively impacted Abelcet sales as clinicians utilize these other therapeutic agents. Pfizer and Schering-Plough have each recently obtained approval for an additional  new product in the antifungal market that is expected to further increase competition. In addition, Astellas Pharma and Gilead Sciences, Inc. are currently marketing AmBisome, and Three Rivers Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is marketing Amphotec, each of which is a lipid-based version of amphotericin B, for the treatment of fungal infections.  AmBisome and Amphotec each compete with Abelcet which has resulted in greater competitive pressure on Abelcet sales. During calendar year 2007, we continued to experience increasing pricing pressure with respect to Abelcet. In particular, Astellas Pharma and Gilead Sciences, Inc., have aggressively lowered the price of their  product in certain regions and for certain customers in the U.S. This has resulted in the shrinkage or loss of certain of our customer accounts. While we are developing and implementing strategies to address the competitive threats facing Abelcet, we cannot assure you that we will be able to increase sales of Abelcet or prevent further  decreases in Abelcet sales. If we are not successful in addressing the competitive threats, it could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and prospects.If our contract manufacturing customers terminate their agreements with us and we fail to replace contract manufacturing for third parties, we will lose revenues and our costs of goods on our own products will increase.We utilize excess manufacturing capacity to provide contract manufacturing services for a number of third parties. This provides revenues and also allows us to spread fixed costs of our manufacturing facility across26those third party products in addition to our own products manufactured at that facility. If the volume of contract manufacturing services decreases, our revenues from those activities will decrease. Additionally, a greater portion of the fixed costs of our facility will be allocated to our products, which will increase the overall cost of goods  on those products.Currently, we manufacture Abelcet (for sale outside of the U.S. and Canada) and Myocet, both for Cephalon. Our manufacturing agreements with Cephalon are scheduled to expire on January 1, 2010 for Myocet and November 22, 2011 for Abelcet. We also currently manufacture the injectable multivitamin MVI for Hospira.  Pursuant to a notice of termination from Hospira, our manufacturing agreement with Hospira will terminate effective April 30, 2010. Other of our manufacturing agreements do not have long term commitments.If we fail to enter into new manufacturing agreements with third parties to replace agreements that terminate, our revenues, cost of goods and our overall profit margins will suffer.We will need to obtain additional financing to meet our future capital needs and our significant debt level may adversely affect our ability to do so. Failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operations.Our current development projects and marketing initiatives require substantial capital. We will continue to expend substantial resources for research and development, including costs associated with developing our product candidates and conducting clinical trials. We believe that our current cash and investments and our anticipated  cash flow from operations will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for the near future, but we will likely need to increase our cash flow from operations or obtain financing to meet our future capital needs, which we expect will be substantial. We will require substantial additional funds to conduct research activities, preclinical studies,  clinical trials and other activities relating to the successful commercialization of potential products. In addition, we may seek to acquire additional products, technologies and companies, which could require substantial capital. The competitive pressures impacting PEG-INTRON and Abelcet will cause our cash flow from operations to  decrease rather than increase in the future and we cannot be sure that additional funds from other sources will be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If adequate funds are unavailable from operations or additional sources of financing, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or  development programs or one or more of our potential acquisitions of technologies or companies, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operations.We may seek to raise any necessary additional funds through equity or debt financings, collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or other sources which may be dilutive to existing stockholders. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional funds on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, particularly if  the current macroeconomic trends continue.As of December 31, 2008, we had $270.5 million of outstanding indebtedness related to our outstanding that are due in 2013 convertible notes. Our significant debt level could limit our ability to obtain additional financing and could have other important negative consequences, including:                increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;    requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our expected cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of our expected cash flow available for other purposes;    limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we compete;    placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage relative to less leveraged competitors and competitors that have better access to capital resources; and    making it difficult or impossible for us to pay the principal amount of the 2013 notes at maturity, or the repurchase price of the 2013 notes upon a fundamental change, including accrued and unpaid interest.27We depend on our collaborative partners; if we lose our collaborative partners or they do not apply adequate resources to our collaborations, our product development and financial performance may suffer.We rely and will depend heavily in the future on collaborations with partners, primarily pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, for one or more of the research, development, manufacturing, marketing and other commercialization activities relating to our product candidates. In particular, we depend on Santaris for  development of additional LNA compounds. If we lose our collaborative partners, or if they do not apply adequate resources to our collaborations, our product development and financial performance may suffer.The amount and timing of resources dedicated by our collaborators to their collaborations with us are not within our control. If any collaborator breaches or terminates its agreements with us or fails to conduct its collaborative activities in a timely manner, the commercialization of our product candidates could be slowed or blocked  completely. For example, Santaris can terminate its agreement with respect to a specific LNA compound provided by Santaris if we do not achieve certain development milestones for that compound. In addition, our collaborative partners may change their strategic focus, pursue alternative technologies or develop alternative products as a  means for developing treatments for the diseases targeted by these collaborative programs and these could compete with products we are developing. Also, due to the recent tightening of global credit, there may be a disruption or delay in the performance of our collaborators commitments. If such third parties are unable to satisfy their  commitments to us, our business would be adversely affected.Further, our collaborations may not be successful. Disputes may arise between us and our collaborators as to a variety of matters, including financing obligations under our agreements and ownership of intellectual property rights. These disputes may be both expensive and time-consuming and may result in delays in the development  and commercialization of products. If any of the product candidates that we are commercializing with collaborators are delayed or blocked from entering the market or we experience increased costs as a result of our relationship with our collaborators, our financial performance could be adversely affected.We purchase some of the compounds utilized in our products from a single source or a limited group of suppliers, and the partial or complete loss of one of these suppliers could cause production delays and a substantial loss of revenues.We purchase the unmodified compounds and bulk PEGs utilized in our approved products and products under development from outside suppliers. In some cases, we have a limited number of suppliers. Moreover, in some cases, we have no supply agreement. Specifically, our ability to obtain compounds for our respective products  may be limited by the following factors.Oncaspar. We have supply agreements with Ovation Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Kyowa Hakko to produce the unmodified forms of L-asparaginase, the active ingredient used in the production of Oncaspar. Our agreement with Ovation Pharmaceuticals, Inc. provides for Ovation to supply L-asparaginase to us through 2009. We have  committed to effectuate a technology transfer of the cell line and manufacturing of the L-asparaginase to our own supplier by December 31, 2009, and then supply L-asparaginase back to Ovation during the years 2010-2012. It is possible that we will not be able to successfully complete the technology transfer by the deadline or at all, due  to technological, manufacturing, regulatory, clinical development or other issues. If we are unable to effectuate the technology transfer by the deadline, we may not be able to manufacture or sell Oncaspar, which would result in a substantial loss of revenues and damage to our business. Also, if we are unable to supply L-asparaginase back  to Ovation during the years 2010-2012, we could be required to pay damages to Ovation in the amounts of $5.0 million in 2010, $10.0 million in 2011 and $15.0 million in 2012 in connection with a breach of our obligation to supply L-asparaginase to them.Adagen. We purchase the unmodified adenosine deaminase enzyme used in the manufacture of Adagen from Roche Diagnostics. Roche Diagnostics, which is based in Germany, is the only FDA-approved supplier of the adenosine deaminase enzyme, or ADA, used in Adagen. During 2002, we obtained FDA approval of the use of  the ADA enzyme obtained from bovine intestines from cattle of New Zealand origin. New Zealand currently certifies that its cattle are bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or mad cow disease) free. Beginning in September 2002, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) required all animal-sourced materials shipped to the U.S.  from any European country to contain a veterinary certificate that the product is BSE free, regardless28of the country of origin. Our ADA supply agreement with Roche Diagnostics terminated in 2004 although we are still receiving our supply of ADA from them. We are currently developing ADA using a recombinant source as an alternative to the naturally-derived bovine product. This is a difficult and expensive undertaking as to which  success cannot be assured. Roche Diagnostics continues to supply us with our requirements of ADA and indicated when they terminated the supply agreement that they will continue to do so for a reasonable period of time as we work to develop another source of ADA. We may have little or no notice if Roche Diagnostics decides to stop  supplying us with ADA. If we are unable to secure an alternative source of ADA before Roche Diagnostics discontinues supplying the material to us, may experience inventory shortages and potentially a period of product unavailability or a long-term inability to produce Adagen. If this occurs, it will have a measurable (and potentially  material) negative impact on our business and results of operations and it could potentially result in significant reputational harm and regulatory difficulties.Abelcet. In the manufacture of Abelcet, we combine amphotericin B with two phospholipids to produce an injectable lipid complex formulation of amphotericin B. We currently have a long-term supply agreement for amphotericin B,with Axellia. Additionally, we are seeking to qualify at least one additional source of supply of  amphotericin B. We might not be able to obtain production and regulatory approval of Abelcet incorporating the alternative amphotericin B.In addition, due to recent tightening of global credit, there may be disruption or delay in the performance of our suppliers.If we experience a delay in obtaining or are unable to obtain any compound for any of the products discussed above on reasonable terms, or at all, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. No assurance can be given that in any case alternative suppliers with appropriate  regulatory authorizations could be readily identified if necessary. If we experience delays in obtaining or are unable to obtain any such compounds on reasonable terms, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.If we are required to obtain an alternate source for an unmodified compound utilized in a product, the FDA and relevant foreign regulatory agencies will likely require that we perform additional testing to demonstrate that the alternate material is biologically and chemically equivalent to the unmodified compound previously used in  our clinical trials. This testing could delay or stop development of a product, limit commercial sales of an approved product and cause us to incur significant additional expenses. If we are unable to demonstrate that the alternate material is chemically and biologically equivalent to the previously used unmodified compound, we will likely  be required to repeat some or all of the preclinical and clinical trials conducted for the compound. The marketing of an FDA approved drug could be disrupted while such tests are conducted. Even if the alternate material is shown to be chemically and biologically equivalent to the previously used compound, the FDA or relevant foreign  regulatory agency may require that we conduct additional clinical trials with the alternate material.Our product candidates must undergo extensive clinical testing, the results of which are highly uncertain and could substantially delay or prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval.Before we can market a product, we must obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate. To obtain regulatory approval, we must undertake extensive clinical testing in humans to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities for each indication. The pre-clinical testing  and clinical trials for any product candidates that we develop must comply with the regulations of numerous federal, state and local government authorities in the U.S., principally the FDA, and those of similar agencies in other countries. Clinical trials of new product candidates sufficient to obtain regulatory marketing approval are  expensive and take years to complete.Even though they consume substantial resources, the outcome of these trials is highly uncertain. Safety and efficacy results from pre-clinical studies involving animals and other models and from early clinical trials are often not accurate indicators of results of later-stage clinical trials that involve larger human populations, and,  moreover, may not always be representative of results obtained while marketing an approved drug, particularly with regard to safety. In addition, we may suffer significant setbacks in clinical trials, even after achieving promising results in earlier trials. For example, Phase II activity may not replicate Phase I results or29Phase III efficacy data may not replicate Phase II data. Any adverse results from studies, including clinical trials, could have a negative effect on our ability to obtain the approval of the FDA or other regulatory agencies. Unfavorable results of clinical trials conducted by our competitors or other biotechnology companies could also  adversely affect our ability to gain regulatory approval of our product candidates by increasing government examination and complexity of clinical trials. Government and public concerns over safety issues associated with pharmaceutical and biological products could potentially result in termination of clinical trials on entire classes of  drug candidates, lengthen the trial process for product categories, increase legal and production costs relating to certain drug categories, and/or expand the safety labeling for approved products.As an example, we recently discontinued our Phase Ib clinical trials for our rhMBL product candidate. These trials did not produce results that would support advancing the compound to further clinical trials.Clinical development of any product candidate that we decide to take into clinical trials may be delayed or prevented at any time for some or all of the following reasons:                negative or ambiguous results regarding the efficacy of the product candidate;    undesirable side effects that delay or extend the trials or make the product candidate not medically or commercially viable;    inability to recruit and qualify a sufficient number of patients for our trials;    regulatory delays or other regulatory actions, including changes in regulatory requirements;    difficulties in obtaining sufficient quantities of the product candidate manufactured under current good manufacturing practices;    delays, suspension or termination of the trials imposed by us, an independent institutional review board for a clinical trial site, or clinical holds placed upon the trials by the FDA; and    our failure to obtain adequate financial resources to fund these trials.We depend on third parties to conduct the clinical trials for our product candidates and any failure of those parties to fulfill their obligations could harm our development and commercialization plans.We depend on independent clinical investigators, contract research organizations, academic institutions and other third-party service providers to conduct clinical trials for our product candidates. Though we rely heavily on these parties for successful execution of our clinical trials, we are ultimately responsible for the results of their  activities and many aspects of their activities are beyond our control. For example, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the general investigational plan and protocols for the trial, but the independent clinical investigators may prioritize other projects over ours or may fail to timely  communicate issues regarding our products to us. Third parties may not complete activities on schedule or may not conduct our clinical trials in accordance with regulatory requirements or our stated protocols. The early termination of any of our clinical trial arrangements, the failure of third parties to comply with the regulations and  requirements governing clinical trials or our reliance on results of trials that we have not directly conducted or monitored could hinder or delay the development, approval and commercialization of our product candidates and would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.If our clinical trials are not successful, if we experience significant delays in these trials, or if we do not complete our clinical trials, we may not be able to commercialize our product candidates, which would materially harm our business.We depend on patents and proprietary rights, which may offer only limited protection against potential infringement and the development by our competitors of competitive products. The U.S. and foreign patents upon which our original PEG technology was based have expired.The pharmaceutical industry places considerable importance on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for new technologies, products and processes. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to develop and maintain a strong patent position for our products and technologies both in the U.S. and in other countries. If we are  unable to obtain and enforce patent protection for our products and product candidates, our business30could be materially harmed. We have an extensive portfolio of issued U.S. patents and filed applications, many of which have foreign counterparts. These patents, if extensions are not granted, are expected to expire beginning in 2009 through 2028. Under our license agreements, we have exclusively licensed patents related to our  commercial and development products. Of the patents owned or exclusively licensed by us, seven relate to PEG-INTRON, 17 relate to Abelcet and three relate to DepoCyt. Our products, Oncaspar and Adagen, are not covered by any unexpired patents. We have exclusively licensed patents from Santaris related to our HIF-1 alpha  antagonist and our other LNA compounds in development. Although we believe that our patents provide certain protection from competition, we cannot assure you that such patents will be of substantial protection or commercial benefit to us, will afford us adequate protection from competing products, or will not be challenged or  declared invalid. In addition, we cannot assure you that additional U.S. patents or foreign patent equivalents will be issued to us.Issued patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. In addition, court decisions may introduce uncertainty in the enforceability or scope of patents owned by biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. The legal systems of certain countries do not favor the aggressive enforcement of patents, and the laws of foreign  countries may not protect our rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. Therefore, enforceability or scope of our patents in the U.S. or in foreign countries cannot be predicted with certainty, and, as a result, any patents that we own or license may not provide sufficient protection against competitors. We may not be able to obtain  or maintain patent protection for our pending patent applications, those we may file in the future, or those we may license from third parties.While we believe that our patent rights are enforceable, we cannot assure you that any patents that we have issued, that we may issue or that may be licensed to us will be enforceable or valid or will not expire prior to the commercialization of our product candidates, thus allowing others to more effectively compete with us.  Therefore, any patents that we own or license may not adequately protect our product candidates or our future products. If we are not able to protect our patent positions, our business could be materially harmed.We may become aware that certain organizations are engaging in activities that infringe certain of our patents, including our PEG and single-chain antibody, or SCA, technology patents. We cannot assure you that we will be able to enforce our patents and other rights against such organizations.Legal or administrative proceedings may be necessary to defend against claims of infringement or to enforce our intellectual property rights. We have in the past been involved in patent litigation and other proceedings and we may likely become involved in additional patent litigation or proceedings in the future. If we become  involved in any such litigation or proceeding, irrespective of the outcome, we may incur substantial costs, the efforts of our technical and management personnel may be diverted, and such disputes could substantially delay or prevent our product development or commercialization activities, which could materially harm our business,  financial condition and results of operations.Blocking patents or claims of infringement may stop or delay the development of our proprietary products.Other entities may have or obtain proprietary rights that could impair our competitive position. Our commercial success depends in part on avoiding claims of infringement of the patents or proprietary rights of such third parties. Although we investigate the patent protection surrounding our technology and product candidates, there  are numerous patents, each with multiple claims, which makes it difficult to uncover and interpret the extent of patent protection which can lead to uncertainty about our freedom to operate. It is possible that we will not be aware of issued patents or pending patent applications that are relevant to our product candidates because our  searches do not find them or because they are not yet publicly available. Our interpretation of patents could be challenged, leading to litigation, and we could face claims of infringement of rights of which we are unaware.There have been significant litigation and interferences proceedings regarding patent rights, and the patent situation regarding particular products is often complex and uncertain. As we proceed with the development of our product candidates, we may face uncertainty and litigation could result, which could lead to liability for  damages, prevent our development and commercialization efforts and divert resources from our business strategy.31Third parties from time to time may assert that we are infringing their patents, trade secrets, or know-how. In addition, our technology may infringe patents that may issue in the future to third parties. We could incur substantial costs in defending ourselves and our partners against any such claims. Furthermore, parties making such  claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability or our partners ability to further develop or commercialize some or all of our products or technology in the U.S. and abroad, and could result in the award of substantial damages. If we are found to infringe, we may be required to  obtain one or more licenses from third parties or be unable to proceed. We may not be able to obtain such licenses at a reasonable cost, if at all. Defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any such required license could have a material adverse effect on us.We may have to develop or license alternative technologies if we are unable to maintain or obtain key technology from third parties.We have licensed patents and patent applications from Santaris. Some of our proprietary rights have been licensed to us under agreements that have performance requirements or other contingencies. The failure to comply with these provisions could lead to termination or modifications of our rights to these licenses. Additionally, we  may need to obtain additional licenses to patents or other proprietary rights from other parties to facilitate development of our proprietary technology base. The ownership of patents exclusively licensed to us may be subject to challenge if inventorship was not adequately investigated and represented. If our existing licenses are terminated  or if we are unable to obtain such additional licenses on acceptable terms, our ability to perform our own research and development and to comply with our obligations under our collaborative agreements may be delayed while we seek to develop or license alternative technologies.The patents upon which our original PEG technology was based have expired and, as a result, the scope of our patent protection is narrower.The U.S and corresponding foreign patents upon which our original PEG technology was based expired in 1996. Without that patent protection, other parties are permitted to make, use or sell products covered by the claims of those patents, subject to other patents, including those which we hold. We have obtained numerous patents  with claims covering improved methods of attaching or linking PEG to therapeutic compounds. However, these patents may not enable us to prevent competition or competitors may develop alternative methods of attaching PEG to compounds potentially resulting in competitive products outside the protection that may be afforded by our  patents. We are aware that others have also filed patent applications and have been granted patents in the U.S. and other countries with respect to the application of PEG to proteins and other compounds.We or our suppliers could experience delays or difficulties in manufacturing, including problems complying with the FDAs regulations for manufacturing our products. These problems could materially harm our business.Manufacturers of drugs must comply with current cGMP regulations, which include quality control and quality assurance requirements as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Manufacturing facilities are subject to ongoing periodic inspection by the FDA and corresponding state agencies, including  unannounced inspections of our commercial manufacturing facilities. We or our present or future suppliers may be unable to comply with the applicable cGMP regulations and other FDA regulatory requirements.Adagen and Oncaspar, which we manufacture, use our earlier PEG technology which tends to be less stable than the PEG technology used in PEG-INTRON and our products under development. Due, in part, to the drawbacks in the earlier technologies we have had and may continue to have manufacturing problems with these  products.We continue to face manufacturing and stability issues with Oncaspar. To date, we have been unable to identify the cause of these issues. If we continue to have these issues with Oncaspar, we may have a disruption in our ability to manufacture Oncaspar. Manufacturing and stability problems have required us to implement voluntary  recalls or market withdrawals for certain batches of Oncaspar periodically since 2002 and as recently32as the fourth quarter of 2006. Mandatory recalls can also take place if regulators or courts require them, even if we believe our products are safe and effective. Recalls result in lost sales of the recalled products themselves and can result in further lost sales while replacement products are manufactured or due to customer dissatisfaction.  We cannot assure you that future product recalls or market withdrawals will not materially adversely affect our business, our financial condition, results of operations or our reputation and relationships with our customers. Disruption in supply or manufacturing difficulties relating to Oncaspar could cause a disruption in our ability to  market and sell Oncaspar and result in a substantial loss of revenues.The FDA and the MHRA, the British equivalent of the FDA, have conducted periodic inspections of our manufacturing facilities related to Abelcet, Oncaspar and Adagen. Following certain of these inspections, the FDA has issued Form 483 reports citing deviations from cGMP, the most recent of which was issued in July 2008 for  our Indianapolis facility. We have worked with the FDA to resolve the matters identified therein.We are aware that the FDA has conducted inspections of certain of the manufacturing facilities of Schering-Plough, who manufactures PEG-INTRON, and Merck, who manufactures the L-asparaginase that we receive from Ovation Pharmaceuticals for use in the production of Oncaspar, and those inspections have resulted in the  issuance of Forms 483 citing deviations from cGMP.If we or our partners face additional manufacturing problems in the future or if we or our licensees are unable to satisfactorily resolve current or future manufacturing problems, the FDA could require us or our licensees to discontinue the distribution of our products or to delay continuation of clinical trials.Our arrangements with third-party manufacturers involve significant financial commitments and costs that may be incurred if we terminate or delay manufacturing.We depend on the manufacturing capabilities of third parties to manufacture drug substances used in certain of our products. Our contractual arrangements with these manufacturers require us to commit to planned manufacturing activities. If we were to terminate or delay these activities, we may be required to pay termination fees or  other delay-related charges and these amounts may be significant. The need to terminate or delay planned manufacturing activities could arise from a delay in a clinical trial or regulatory approval, an inability to transfer our technology and complex processes to the third-party manufacturers or other reasons that may be beyond our  control.We may be subject to a variety of types of product liability or other claims based on allegations that the use of our products has resulted in adverse effects, whether by participants in our clinical trials or by patients using our products, and our insurance may not cover all product liability or other claims.We may face liability claims related to the use or misuse of our products and product candidates in clinical trials or in commercial use. Liability claims may be expensive to defend and may result in large judgments against us.Although we maintain product liability insurance for claims arising from the use of our products in clinical trials prior to FDA approval and for claims arising from the use of our products after FDA approval at levels that we believe are appropriate, we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our existing insurance  coverage or obtain additional coverage on commercially reasonable terms for the use of our other products in the future. Also, our insurance coverage and our resources may not be sufficient to satisfy any liability resulting from product liability claims, and a product liability claim could materially harm our business, financial condition or  results of operations.Generally, our clinical trials are conducted in patients with serious life-threatening diseases for whom conventional treatments have been unsuccessful, and, during the course of treatment, these patients could suffer adverse medical effects or die for reasons that may or may not be related to our products. Any of these events could  result in a claim of liability. Any such claims against us, regardless of their merit, could result in significant costs to defend or awards against us that could materially harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.33We depend on key personnel and may not be able to retain these employees or recruit additional qualified personnel, which would harm our business.Because of the specialized scientific nature of our business, we are highly dependent upon qualified scientific, technical and managerial personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer. There is intense competition for qualified personnel in the pharmaceutical field. Therefore, we may not be able to attract and retain the qualified  personnel necessary for the development of our business. Although we have employment agreements with our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Scientific Officer, our ability to continue to retain such officers, as well as other senior executives or key managers is not assured. The loss of the services of one or a  combination of our senior executives, particularly our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief Scientific Officer, as well as the failure to recruit additional key scientific, technical and managerial personnel in a timely manner, would have an adverse effect on our business.Risks Related to Our IndustrySignificant competition for our technology platforms and product candidates could make our technologies or product candidates obsolete or uncompetitive, which would negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by extensive research and development effort, and rapid technological change. Our future success will depend on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to technological advances. Rapid technological development by others may result in our product candidates and  technologies becoming obsolete.We face intense competition from established biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, as well as academic and research institutions that are pursuing competing technologies and products. We know that competitors are developing or manufacturing various platform technologies and products that are used for the prevention,  diagnosis or treatment of diseases that we have targeted for product development. For example, PEG INTRON faces increased competition from Hoffman La-Roches Pegasys, Abelcet faces increased competition from Astellas Pharma and Gilead Pharmaceuticals AmBisome and Three Rivers Pharmaceuticals Amphotec. DepoCyt  competes with the generic drugs, cytarabine and methotrexate, and Oncaspar competes with ELSPAR® (asparaginase). In November 2006, the FDA accepted an IND for OPiSA (France) for its product, Erwinase (Erwinia chryanthemi L-asparaginase). Erwinase is approved in several countries outside the U.S. for treatment of ALL. Other  existing and future products, therapies and technological approaches will compete directly with out products. Current and prospective competing products may provide greater therapeutic benefits for a specific problem or may offer comparable performance at a lower cost. In addition, any product candidate that we develop and that  obtains regulatory approval must then compete for market acceptance and market share.Our competitors in the PEGylation technology field include The Dow Chemical Company, Nektar Pharmaceuticals, Inc., SunBio Corporation, Mountain View Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Neose Technologies, Inc., NOF Corporation and Urigen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Several other chemical, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  may also be developing PEGylation technologies. Some of these companies license or provide the technology to other companies, while others develop the technology for internal use.Other companies are conducting research and developing products utilizing antisense technologies that compete with the LNA technology. These include Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc., Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Regulus Therapeutics LLC, Eli Lilly and Company and others. In addition, there are a number of existing therapeutic  regimens designed to treat the cancers that we may target with the HIF-1 alpha antagonist. However, we are not of aware of any development of another compound that would have a mechanism similar to our HIF-1 alpha antagonist.There are a number of drugs in various stages of preclinical and clinical development from companies exploring cancer therapies or improved chemotherapeutic agents to potentially treat the same cancer indications that our PEG-SN38 may be developed to treat. Additionally, there are a number of drugs in development based on the  active metabolite SN38. If these drugs are approved, they could compete directly with our PEG-SN38. These include products in development from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Pfizer Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc,34Antigenics Inc., Hoffman-La Roche Ltd., Novartis AG, Cell Therapeutics, Inc., Neopharm, Inc., Meditech Research Limited and others. Nektar Therapeutics is also developing a PEGylated form of irinotecan. Irinotecan is a pro-drug of SN38. This product candidate is currently in Phase II for colorectal cancer. Nektar commenced Phase II  studies in metastatic breast, platinum-resistant ovarian, cervical, and second-line colorectal cancer in January of 2009.There are a number of existing therapeutic regimens designed to treat the cancers that we may target with the Survivin antagonist. We are aware of several companies, including Isis Pharmaceuticals/Eli Lilly, Astellas, Erimos and Aegera, that are actively working on compounds targeting Survivin.Also, we are aware that other companies provide contract manufacturing for the pharmaceutical industry, including liposomal and PEGylation services such as Bell-Moore Labs, Ben Venue and Abbott One 2 One. These companies also provide manufacturing services from preclinical to commercial.Many of our competitors have substantially greater research and development capabilities and experience and greater manufacturing, marketing and financial resources than we do. In addition, many of our competitors have much more experience than we do in pre-clinical testing and human clinical trials of new drugs, as well as in  obtaining FDA and other regulatory approval. We face competition from these companies not just in product development but also in areas such as recruiting employees, acquiring technologies that might enhance our ability to commercialize products, establishing relationships with certain research and academic institutions, enrolling  patients in clinical trials and seeking program partnerships and collaborations with larger pharmaceutical companies. Accordingly, our competitors may develop technologies and products that are superior to those we or our collaborators are developing and render our technologies and products or those of our collaborators obsolete and  noncompetitive. If we cannot compete effectively, our business and financial performance would suffer.The regulatory approval process is highly uncertain and we will not be allowed to market products if regulatory approval has not been obtained.The marketing of pharmaceutical products in the U.S. and abroad is subject to stringent governmental regulation. The sale of any new products for use in humans in the U.S. requires the prior approval of the FDA for each new product. If our products are marketed abroad, they will also be subject to extensive regulation by foreign  governments, whether or not we have obtained FDA approval for a given product and its indications. The FDA has established mandatory procedures and safety standards that apply to the clinical testing and marketing of pharmaceutical products. The FDA regulates the research, development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, manufacture,  safety, effectiveness, record-keeping, reporting, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale, distribution, import and export of pharmaceutical and biological products. Obtaining FDA approval for a new therapeutic product may take many years and involve substantial expenditures. Compliance with these regulations can be  costly, time-consuming and subject us to unanticipated delays in developing our products. Neither we nor our licensees may be able to obtain or maintain FDA or other relevant marketing approval for any of our products.There may be limitations placed on our ability to successfully market our products by the FDA or foreign regulators.Regulatory approval may:                limit the indicated uses for a product;    otherwise limit our ability to promote, sell and distribute the product;    require that we conduct costly post-marketing surveillance; and    require that we conduct ongoing post-marketing studiesMaterial changes to an approved product, such as manufacturing changes or revised labeling, may require further regulatory review and approval. Once obtained, any approvals may be withdrawn for a number of reasons, including the later discovery of previously unknown problems with the product, such as a safety issue. If we or  our third-party manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements at any stage during the regulatory process, such noncompliance could result in:35                refusals or delays in the approval of applications or supplements to approved applications;    refusal of a regulatory authority, including the FDA, to review pending market approval applications or supplements to approved applications;    warning letters;    import or export restrictions;    product recalls or seizures;    injunctions;    total or partial suspension of production;    fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecutions; and    withdrawals of previously approved marketing applications or licenses.In addition, any approved products are subject to continuing regulation. Among other things, the holder of an approved biologic license application or new drug application is subject to periodic and other FDA monitoring and reporting obligations, including obligations to monitor and report adverse events and instances of the failure  of a product to meet the specifications in the biologic license application or new drug application. Application holders must also submit advertising and other promotional material to the FDA and report on ongoing clinical trials. Failure to meet these post-approval requirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties,  injunctions, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, or denial or withdrawal of pre-marketing product approvals.Even if we are granted regulatory approval in one jurisdiction, we may not receive regulatory approval in another jurisdiction.Failure to obtain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions would prevent us from marketing our products abroad. In order to market our products in the European Union and many other jurisdictions outside the U.S., we must obtain separate regulatory approvals and comply with numerous foreign regulatory requirements. The  approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. The foreign regulatory approval process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval. We may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a  timely basis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA. We may not be able to file for regulatory approvals and may not receive necessary  approvals to commercialize our products in any market. The failure to obtain these approvals could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.If we or our licensees fail to obtain or maintain requisite governmental approvals or fail to obtain or maintain approvals of the scope requested, it will delay or preclude us or our licensees or marketing partners from marketing our products. It could also limit the commercial use of our products. Any such failure or limitation may  have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Once approved, our products may not be accepted in the marketplace.Even if clinical trials demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates and all regulatory approvals are obtained, the commercial success of our products depends on gaining market acceptance among physicians, patients, third-party payors or the medical community. The degree of market acceptance will depend on many  factors, including:                the scope of regulatory approvals, including limitations or warnings contained in a products FDA-approved labeling;    establishment and demonstration of clinical efficacy and safety;    cost-effectiveness of our products;    alternative treatment methods and potentially competitive products; and36    the availability of third-party reimbursement.Market acceptance could be further limited depending on the prevalence and severity of any expected or unexpected adverse side effects associated with our product candidates. If our product candidates are approved but do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, third party payors and patients, we may never  generate significant revenue from these products, and our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially harmed.Our operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations.Our operations are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous, toxic and radioactive substances and the discharge of pollutants into the air and water. Environmental permits and controls are  required for some of our operations and these permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation by the issuing authorities. If we were to become liable for an accident, or if we were to suffer an extended facility shutdown as a result of such contamination, we could incur significant costs, damages and penalties that could harm  our business and exceed our resources or insurance coverage.The successful commercialization of our products and product candidates will depend on obtaining coverage and reimbursement for use of these products from third-party payors and these payors may not agree to cover or reimburse for use of our products.Our future revenues and profitability will be adversely affected if U.S. and foreign governmental, private third-party insurers and payors, and other third-party payors, including Medicare and Medicaid, do not agree to defray or reimburse the cost of our products to the patients. If these entities refuse to provide coverage and  reimbursement with respect to our products or provide an insufficient level of coverage and reimbursement, our products may be too costly for many patients to afford them, and physicians may not prescribe them.In addition, the amount of reimbursement for our products may also reduce our profitability. In the U.S., there have been, and we expect will continue to be, actions and proposals to control and reduce healthcare costs. Government and other third-party payors are challenging the prices charged for healthcare products and  increasingly limiting, and attempting to limit, both coverage and level of reimbursement for prescription drugs.If our products or product candidates are unable to obtain adequate coverage and reimbursement by third-party payors our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates may be adversely impacted. Any limitation on the use of our products or any decrease in the price of our products will have a material adverse effect  on our ability to achieve profitability.In certain foreign countries, pricing, coverage and level of reimbursement of prescription drugs are subject to governmental control, and we may be unable to negotiate coverage, pricing, and reimbursement on terms that are favorable to us. In some foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be  lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. Our results of operations may suffer if we are unable to market our products in foreign countries or if coverage and reimbursement for our products in foreign countries is limited.The law or FDA policy could change and expose us to competition from generic or follow-on versions of our products, which could adversely impact our business.Under current U.S. law and FDA policy, generic versions of conventional chemical drug compounds, sometimes referred to as small molecule compounds, may be approved through an abbreviated approval process. There is no abbreviated approval process under current law for biological products approved under the Public Health  Service Act through a Biologic License Application, such as monoclonal antibodies, cytokines, growth factors, enzymes, interferons and certain other proteins. However, various proposals have been made to establish an abbreviated approval process to permit approval of generic or follow-on versions of these types of biological products  under U.S. law, and the FDAs counterpart in the European Union has recently approved a number of follow-on biologicals. It is not clear whether any proposed legislation on generic or follow-on biologics will become law, or what form that law might take. However, if the law is changed or if the FDA somehow extends its existing  authority in new ways, and third parties are permitted to obtain approvals of37versions of our biological products through an abbreviated approval mechanism, and without conducting full clinical studies of their own, it could adversely affect our business.Risks Related to Our Common Stock and Our Convertible NotesThe price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile, which also may significantly affect the trading price of our convertible notes.Historically, the market price of our common stock has fluctuated over a wide range, and it is likely that the price of our common stock will continue to be volatile in the future. The market price of our common stock could be impacted due to a variety of factors, including, in addition to global and industry-wide events:                the level of revenues we generate from our sale of products and royalties we receive;    the losses we incur or the profits we generate;    the results of preclinical testing and clinical trials by us, our collaborative partners or our competitors;    announcements of technical innovations or new products by us, our collaborative partners or our competitors;    the status of corporate collaborations and supply arrangements;    regulatory approvals;    developments in patent or other proprietary rights;    public concern as to the safety and efficacy of products developed by us or others; and    litigation.In addition, due to one or more of the foregoing factors in one or more future quarters, our results of operations may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In that event, the market price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected. Volatility in the price of our common stock may  significantly affect the trading price of our convertible notes.Events with respect to our share capital could cause the shares of our common stock outstanding to increase.Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the open market, or the availability of such shares for sale, could adversely affect the price of our common stock. We had approximately 45 million shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2008. As of that date, the following securities that may be exercised for, or  are convertible into, shares of our common stock were outstanding:                Options. Stock options to purchase 8.4 million shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of approximately $11.30 per share;    4% convertible senior notes due 2013 (the 2013 convertible notes). Our 2013 convertible notes may be converted into 28.3 million shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $9.55 per share.    Restricted stock units. 1.8 million shares of our common stock issuable in respect of outstanding restricted stock units held by officers, employees and directors.The shares of our common stock that may be issued under the options, restricted stock units, and the 2013 convertible notes are currently registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and, therefore, those shares of common stock that may be issued will be eligible for public resale.The conversion of some or all of the convertible notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the notes may encourage short  selling by market participants because the conversion of the notes could depress the price of our common stock.38Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law may make it more difficult to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders.Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders. These anti-takeover provisions include:                a classified board of directors whereby not all members of the board may be elected at one time;    lack of a provision for cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates;    the ability of our board to authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock to increase the number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;    advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and    limitations on who may call a special meeting of stockholders.Further, we have in place a stockholder rights plan, commonly known as a poison pill. The provisions described above, our stockholder rights plan and provisions of Delaware law relating to business combinations with interested stockholders may discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us. These provisions may  also discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring a large portion of our securities, or initiating a tender offer, even if our stockholders might receive a premium for their shares in the acquisition over the then current market price. We also have agreements with our executive officers that provide for change of control severance  benefits which provides for cash severance, restricted stock and option award vesting acceleration and other benefits in the event our employees are terminated (or, in some cases, resign for specified reasons) following an acquisition. These agreements could discourage a third party from acquiring us.The issuance of preferred stock may adversely affect rights of common stockholders.Under our certificate of incorporation, our board of directors has the authority to issue up to three million shares of blank check preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by our stockholders. The rights of the holders of common stock will be  subject to the rights of the holders of any shares of preferred stock that may be issued in the future. In addition to discouraging a takeover, as discussed above, this blank check preferred stock may have rights, including economic rights senior to the common stock, and, as a result, the issuance of such preferred stock could have a  material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock.We may be unable to redeem our 2013 convertible notes upon a fundamental change.We may be unable to redeem the 2013 convertible notes in the event of a fundamental change, as defined in the related indenture. Upon a fundamental change, holders of the 2013 convertible notes may require us to redeem all or a portion of the 2013 convertible notes. If a fundamental change were to occur, we may not have  enough funds to pay the redemption price for all tendered 2013 convertible notes. Any future credit agreements or other agreements relating to our indebtedness may contain similar provisions, or expressly prohibit the repurchase of the 2013 convertible notes upon a fundamental change or may provide that a fundamental change  constitutes an event of default under that agreement. If a fundamental change occurs at a time when we are prohibited from purchasing or redeeming 2013 convertible notes, we could seek the consent of our lenders to redeem the 2013 convertible notes or could attempt to refinance this debt. If we do not obtain a consent, we could not  purchase or redeem the 2013 convertible notes. Our failure to redeem tendered 2013 convertible notes would constitute an event of default under the indenture governing the 2013 convertible notes.The term fundamental change is limited to certain specified transactions as defined in the indenture governing the 2013 convertible notes and may not include other events that might adversely affect our financial condition or the market value of the 2013 convertible notes or our common stock. Our obligation to offer to redeem the  2013 convertible notes upon a fundamental change would not necessarily afford holders of the 2013 convertible notes protection in the event of a highly leveraged transaction, reorganization, merger or similar transaction involving us.39The market for unrated debt is subject to disruptions that could have an adverse effect on the market price of the 2013 convertible notes, or a market for our notes may fail to develop or be sustained.The 2013 convertible notes are not rated. As a result, holders of the notes have the risks associated with an investment in unrated debt. Historically, the market for unrated debt has been subject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of such securities and greatly reduced liquidity for the holders of such  securities. If the notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending on, among other things, prevailing interest rates, the markets for similar securities, general economic conditions and our financial condition, results of operations and prospects. The liquidity of, and trading markets for, the notes also  may be adversely affected by general declines in the market for unrated debt. Such declines may adversely affect the liquidity of, and trading markets for, the notes, independent of our financial performance or prospects. In addition, certain regulatory restrictions prohibit certain types of financial institutions from investing in unrated debt,  which may further suppress demand for such securities. We cannot assure you that the market for the notes will not be subject to similar disruptions or that any market for our notes will develop or be sustained. Any such disruptions may have an adverse effect on the holders of the notes.We may not have sufficient funds available to pay amounts due under our 2013 convertible notes.We may not have sufficient funds available or may be unable to arrange for additional financing to satisfy our obligations under our 2013 notes. Our ability to pay cash to holders of the notes or meet our payment and other debt obligations depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future. This, to some extent, is  subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors, as well as other factors that are beyond our control. Also, the indenture governing our 2013 convertible notes does not contain any financial or operating covenants or restrictions on the payments of dividends, the incurrence of indebtedness or the  issuance or repurchase of securities by us or any of our subsidiaries. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our payment obligations under the notes and our other obligations and to fund other liquidity  needs"
9,ENZN,ENZON PHARMACEUTICALS INC,2008-02-29,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
     Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have made forward-looking statements in anattempt to better enable the reader to understand our future prospects and make informed judgments.By their nature, forward-looking statements are subject to numerous factors that may influenceoutcomes or even prevent their eventual realization. Such factors may be external to Enzon andentirely outside our control.     We cannot guarantee that our assumptions and expectations will be correct. Failure of eventsto be achieved or of certain underlying assumptions to prove accurate could cause actual results tovary materially from past results and those anticipated or projected. We do not intend to updateforward-looking statements.     Certain risks and uncertainties are discussed below. It is not possible to predict oridentify all such factors, however. Accordingly, you should not consider this recitation to becomplete.Risks Related to Our Business     If any of these risks are realized our business, prospects, financial condition, results ofoperations and our ability to service debt could be materially adversely affected.We expect to incur losses over the next several years.     As of December 31, 2007, we had an accumulated deficit of $299.5 million. We expect to incurlosses over the next several years, including for the year ending December 31, 2008, as we expectto make significant research and development expenditures.     Our ability to achieve long-term profitability will depend primarily on:  the success of our research and development programs;   the continued sales of our marketed products and the products on which we receiveroyalties; and   our and our licensees ability to develop and obtain regulatory approvals foradditional product candidates.There is a high risk that our early-stage research and development might not generate successfulproduct candidates. Failure to develop and commercialize our product candidates could materiallyharm our business.     There is a high risk of failure for pharmaceutical product candidates. Most productcandidates fail to reach the market. Our product candidates are subject to the risks inherent inthe development of new pharmaceutical products, including, but not limited to, risks that the drugmight prove ineffective or may cause harmful side-effects during preclinical testing or clinicaltrials, may fail to receive necessary regulatory approvals, cannot be manufactured on a commercialscale basis and therefore may not be economical to produce, may fail to achieve market acceptanceor that we may be precluded from commercialization by proprietary rights of third parties.     The risk of failure is increased for our product candidates that are based on new technologiesor approaches to the development of therapeutics. For example, our LNA technology is a noveltechnology and there are currently no approved drugs, or even late-stage drug candidates employingthis technology. Product candidates employing these technologies may not advance to pivotal stagesof product development or demonstrate clinical safety or effectiveness. If our technologies failto generate products, or if we do not succeed in the development of these product candidates, ourbusiness could be materially harmed.28Table of Contents     At the present time, the vast majority of our research and development operations are focusedon the early stages of product research and development, and we are conducting or first commencingclinical trials on our product candidates. Success in preclinical testing and early clinical trialsdoes not necessarily predict success in later clinical trials. A number of companies in thepharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in later-stageclinical trials due to such factors as inconclusive results and adverse medical events, even afterachieving positive results in earlier trials. If our product candidates fail in the clinical trialstage, it could materially harm our business prospects.     From time to time, we may establish and announce certain development goals for our productcandidates and programs; however, given the complex nature of the drug discovery and developmentprocess, it is difficult to predict accurately if and when we will achieve these goals. If we areunsuccessful in advancing our preclinical programs into clinical testing or in obtaining regulatoryapproval, our business prospects may be harmed.     We do not expect any of the drugs resulting from our current research and development effortsto be commercially available for several years, if at all. In order to fill our pipeline of productcandidates under development, we may attempt to acquire rights to products under development byother companies. The competition for the acquisition of rights to products that are viewed asviable candidates for successful development and commercialization is intense, and we will becompeting for such opportunities with many companies with resources that are substantially greaterthan ours.Our financial results are heavily dependent on the continued sales of our marketed products and theproducts on which we receive royalties; if revenues from these products fail to increase ormaterially decline, our results of operations, financial position and prospects could be materiallyharmed.     Our results of operations are heavily dependent on the revenues we derive from the sale andmarketing of our products Oncaspar, DepoCyt, Abelcet and Adagen as well as the royalty revenues wereceive on the sale of PEG-INTRON, marketed by Schering-Plough. Starting in the fourth quarter of2007, our PEG-INTRON-related revenues were and will be reduced by our sale to a third-party of a25% interest in those royalties. As a consequence of the significance of these products to us,stagnation or decline in the sales of one or more of them could adversely affect our operatingresults, financial position and prospects.     Sales of our products can be affected by, among other things, competition, patient demand andmanufacturing issues. We cannot assure you that Schering-Plough will continue to be successful inmarketing PEG-INTRON. The amount and timing of resources dedicated by Schering-Plough to themarketing of PEG-INTRON is not within our control. Our royalty revenues will be negativelyaffected if sales of PEG-INTRON are limited for any reason, including if Schering-Plough cannotmarket PEG-INTRON as a result of manufacturing, regulatory or other issues.Sales of PEG-INTRON and Abelcet have been adversely affected by competitive products introducedinto their respective markets and we have experienced in the past and may continue to experience inthe future a decline in sales of Abelcet, which if not reversed, will adversely affect our resultsof operations, financial condition and prospects.     Products that compete with both PEG-INTRON and Abelcet have been and potentially will beintroduced by other drug manufacturers into their respective markets.     Hoffmann-La Roches Pegasys, a competing PEGylated interferon-based combination therapy, hasresulted in significant competitive pressure on PEG-INTRON sales in the U.S. and all internationalmarkets. Pegasys has taken market share away from PEG-INTRON and the overall market for PEGylatedalpha-interferon for the treatment of hepatitis C has been contracting. As a result, sales ofPEG-INTRON in certain markets where it competes with Pegasys and the royalties we receive on thosesales have declined. We cannot assure you that Pegasys will not continue to gain market share atthe expense of PEG-INTRON which could result in lower PEG-INTRON sales and lower royalties to us.While we receive a royalty on sales of Pegasys under our Nektar agreement, it is a smaller royaltythan that received on sales of PEG-INTRON.29Table of Contents     Similarly, the continued sale of newer products from Merck, Pfizer, Schering-Plough andAstellas Pharma in the antifungal market (where Abelcet competes) has negatively impacted Abelcetsales as clinicians utilize these other therapeutic agents. Pfizer and Schering-Plough have eachrecently obtained approval for an additional new product in the antifungal market that is expectedto further increase competition. In addition, Astellas Pharma and Gilead Sciences, Inc. arecurrently marketing AmBisome, and Three Rivers Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is marketing Amphotec, each ofwhich is a lipid-based version of amphotericin B, for the treatment of fungal infections. AmBisomeand Amphotec each compete with Abelcet which has resulted in greater competitive pressure onAbelcet sales. During calendar year 2007, we continued to experience increasing pricing pressurewith respect to Abelcet. In particular, Astellas Pharma and Gilead Sciences, Inc., haveaggressively lowered the price of their product in certain regions and for certain customers in theU.S. This has resulted in the shrinkage or loss of certain of our customer accounts. While we aredeveloping and implementing strategies to address the competitive threats facing Abelcet, we cannotassure you that we will be able to increase sales of Abelcet or prevent further decreases inAbelcet sales. If we are not successful in addressing the competitive threats, it could adverselyaffect our operating results, financial condition and prospects.We will need to obtain additional financing to meet our future capital needs and our significantdebt level may adversely affect our ability to do so. Failure to do so could materially andadversely affect our business, financial condition and operations.     Our current development projects and marketing initiatives require substantial capital. Wewill continue to expend substantial resources for research and development, including costsassociated with developing our product candidates and conducting clinical trials. We believe thatour current cash and investments and our anticipated cash flow from operations will be adequate tosatisfy our capital needs for the near future, but we will likely need to increase our cash flowfrom operations or obtain financing to meet our future capital needs, which we expect will besubstantial. We will require substantial additional funds to conduct research activities,preclinical studies, clinical trials and other activities relating to the successfulcommercialization of potential products. In addition, we may seek to acquire additional products,technologies and companies, which could require substantial capital. The competitive pressuresimpacting PEG-INTRON and Abelcet, and our sale of a 25% interest in the royalties we receive onsales of PEG-INTRON, will cause our cash flow from operations to decrease rather than increase inthe future and we cannot be sure that additional funds from other sources will be available oncommercially reasonable terms, if at all. If adequate funds are unavailable from operations oradditional sources of financing, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or moreof our research or development programs or one or more of our potential acquisitions oftechnologies or companies, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financialcondition and operations.     We may seek to raise any necessary additional funds through equity or debt financings,collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or other sources which may be dilutive toexisting stockholders. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional funds oncommercially reasonable terms, if at all.     As of December 31, 2007, we had $347.4 million of outstanding indebtedness related to ouroutstanding 2013 convertible notes and 2008 convertible notes. Since that date, we have repurchased$59.9 million of the 2008 notes and have restricted cash and investments set aside to repurchase orrepay the remaining $12.5 million of the 2008 notes. Our significant debt level could limit ourability to obtain additional financing and could have other important negative consequences,including:  increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;   requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our expected cash flow fromoperations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of our expected cashflow available for other purposes;   limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business andthe industry in which we compete;30Table of Contents  placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage relative to less leveragedcompetitors and competitors that have better access to capital resources; and   making it difficult or impossible for us to pay the principal amount of the 2013notes at maturity, or the repurchase price of the 2013 notes upon afundamental change, including accrued and unpaid interest.We depend on our collaborative partners; if we lose our collaborative partners or they do not applyadequate resources to our collaborations, our product development and financial performance maysuffer.     We rely and will depend heavily in the future on collaborations with partners, primarilypharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, for one or more of the research, development,manufacturing, marketing and other commercialization activities relating to most of our productcandidates. If we lose our collaborative partners, or if they do not apply adequate resources toour collaborations, our product development and financial performance may suffer.     The amount and timing of resources dedicated by our collaborators to their collaborations withus are not within our control. If any collaborator breaches or terminates its agreements with us,or fails to conduct its collaborative activities in a timely manner, the commercialization of ourproduct candidates could be slowed or blocked completely. We cannot assure you that ourcollaborative partners will not change their strategic focus or pursue alternative technologies ordevelop alternative products as a means for developing treatments for the diseases targeted bythese collaborative programs. Our collaborators could develop competing products.     We cannot assure you that our collaborations will be successful. Disputes may arise between usand our collaborators as to a variety of matters, including financing obligations under ouragreements and ownership of intellectual property rights. These disputes may be both expensive andtime-consuming and may result in delays in the development and commercialization of products. Ifany of the product candidates that we are commercializing with collaborators are delayed or stoppedfrom coming to market or we experience increased costs as a result of our relationship with ourcollaborators, our financial performance could be adversely affected.We purchase some of the compounds utilized in our products from a single source or a limited groupof suppliers, and the partial or complete loss of one of these suppliers could cause productiondelays and a substantial loss of revenues.     We purchase the unmodified compounds and bulk PEGs utilized in our approved products andproducts under development from outside suppliers. In some cases, we have a limited number ofsuppliers. Moreover, in some cases, we have no supply agreement. Specifically, our ability toobtain compounds for our respective products may be limited by the following factors.     Oncaspar. We have supply agreements with Ovation Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Kyowa Hakko toproduce the unmodified forms of L-asparaginase, the active ingredient used in the production ofOncaspar. Our agreement with Ovation Pharmaceuticals, Inc. provides for Ovation to supplyL-asparaginase to us through 2009. We have committed to effectuate a technology transfer of thecell line and manufacturing of the L-asparaginase to our own supplier by December 31, 2009, andthen supply L-asparaginase back to Ovation during the years 2010-2012. It is possible that we willnot be able to successfully complete the technology transfer by the deadline or at all, due totechnological, manufacturing, regulatory, clinical development or other issues. If we are unable toeffectuate the technology transfer by the deadline, we may not be able to manufacture or sellOncaspar, which would result in a substantial loss of revenues and damage to our business. Also,if we are unable to supply L-asparaginase back to Ovation during the years 2010-2012, we could berequired to pay damages to Ovation in the amounts of $5.0 million in 2010, $10.0 million in 2011and $15.0 million in 2012 in connection with a breach of our obligation to supply L-asparaginase tothem.31Table of Contents     Adagen. We purchase the unmodified adenosine deaminase enzyme used in the manufacture ofAdagen from Roche Diagnostics. Roche Diagnostics, which is based in Germany, is the onlyFDA-approved supplier of the adenosine deaminase enzyme, or ADA, used in Adagen. During 2002, weobtained FDA approval of the use of the ADA enzyme obtained from bovine intestines from cattle ofNew Zealand origin. New Zealand currently certifies that its cattle are bovine spongiformencephalopathy (BSE or mad cow disease) free. Beginning in September 2002, the U.S. Department ofAgriculture (USDA) required all animal-sourced materials shipped to the U.S. from any Europeancountry to contain a veterinary certificate that the product is BSE free, regardless of the countryof origin. Our ADA supply agreement with Roche Diagnostics terminated in 2004 although we arestill receiving our supply of ADA from them. We are currently developing ADA using a recombinantsource as an alternative to the naturally-derived bovine product. This is a difficult and expensiveundertaking as to which success cannot be assured. Roche Diagnostics continues to supply us withour requirements of ADA and indicated when they terminated the supply agreement that they willcontinue to do so for a reasonable period of time as we work to develop another source of ADA. Wemay have little or no notice if Roche Diagnostics decides to stop supplying us with ADA. If we areunable to secure an alternative source of ADA before Roche Diagnostics discontinues supplying thematerial to us, may experience inventory shortages and potentially a period of productunavailability or a long-term inability to produce Adagen. If this occurs, it will have ameasurable (and potentially material) negative impact on our business and results of operations andit could potentially result in significant reputational harm and regulatory difficulties.     Abelcet. We have two suppliers that produce the amphotericin B used in the manufacture ofAbelcet: Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) and Alpharma A.p.S. Our supply agreement with BMS terminated onMarch 1, 2006. However, we are currently still receiving supply of amphotericin B from BMS.Additionally, we are seeking to qualify at least one additional source of supply. The terminationof our supply agreement by BMS may give rise to future increased costs for the acquisition ofamphotericin B, and obtaining production and regulatory approval of Abelcet incorporating thealternative amphotericin B.     If we experience a delay in obtaining or are unable to obtain any compound for any of theproducts discussed above on reasonable terms, or at all, it could have a material adverse effect onour business, financial condition and results of operations. No assurance can be given that in anycase alternative suppliers with appropriate regulatory authorizations could be readily identifiedif necessary. If we experience delays in obtaining or are unable to obtain any such compounds onreasonable terms, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition andresults of operations.     If we are required to obtain an alternate source for an unmodified compound utilized in aproduct, the FDA and relevant foreign regulatory agencies will likely require that we performadditional testing to demonstrate that the alternate material is biologically and chemicallyequivalent to the unmodified compound previously used in our clinical trials. This testing coulddelay or stop development of a product, limit commercial sales of an approved product and cause usto incur significant additional expenses. If we are unable to demonstrate that the alternatematerial is chemically and biologically equivalent to the previously used unmodified compound, wewill likely be required to repeat some or all of the preclinical and clinical trials conducted forthe compound. The marketing of an FDA approved drug could be disrupted while such tests areconducted. Even if the alternate material is shown to be chemically and biologically equivalent tothe previously used compound, the FDA or relevant foreign regulatory agency may require that weconduct additional clinical trials with the alternate material.Our product candidates must undergo extensive clinical testing, the results of which are uncertainand could substantially delay or prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval.     Before we can obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate, we must undertake extensiveclinical testing in humans to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA andsimilar foreign regulatory authorities for each indication before they can be approved forcommercialization. The preclinical testing and clinical trials of any product candidates that wedevelop must comply with the regulations of numerous federal, state and local governmentauthorities in the U.S., principally the FDA, and by similar agencies in other countries. Clinicaltrials of new product candidates sufficient to obtain regulatory marketing approval are expensiveand take years to complete, and the outcome32Table of Contents of these trials is uncertain. Clinical development of any product candidate that we determine to take intoclinical trials may be delayed or prevented at any time for some or all of the following reasons:  negative or ambiguous results regarding the efficacy of the product candidate;   undesirable side effects that delay or extend the trials or make the productcandidate not medically or commercially viable;   inability to recruit and qualify a sufficient number of patients for our trials;   regulatory delays or other regulatory actions, including changes in regulatoryrequirements;   difficulties in obtaining sufficient quantities of the product candidatemanufactured under current good manufacturing practices;   delays, suspension or termination of the trials imposed by us, an independentinstitutional review board for a clinical trial site, or clinical holds placed uponthe trials by the FDA; and   we may have inadequate financial resources to fund these trials.     We rely and will continue to rely on clinical investigators, academic institutions,third-party contract research organizations and consultants to perform some or all of the functionsassociated with preclinical testing or clinical trials. While we rely heavily on these parties forsuccessful execution of our clinical trials, we do not control many aspects of their activities.The failure of any of these parties to perform in an acceptable and timely manner, including inaccordance with any applicable regulatory requirements, such as good clinical and laboratorypractices, or preclinical testing or clinical trial protocols, could cause a delay or otherwiseadversely affect our preclinical testing or clinical trials and ultimately the timely advancementof our development programs. We also depend upon third party manufacturers to qualify for FDAapproval and to comply with good manufacturing practices required by regulators. The failure of ourmanufacturers and suppliers to comply with current good manufacturing practices may result in thedelay or termination of clinical studies.     If our clinical trials are not successful, if we experience significant delays in thesetrails, or if we do not complete our clinical trials, we may not be able to commercialize ourproduct candidates, which could materially harm our business.We depend on patents and proprietary rights, which may offer only limited protection againstpotential infringement and the development by our competitors of competitive products. The U.S. andforeign patents upon which our original PEG technology was based have expired.     The pharmaceutical industry places considerable importance on obtaining patent and tradesecret protection for new technologies, products and processes. Our success depends, in part, onour ability to develop and maintain a strong patent position for our products and technologies bothin the U.S. and in other countries. If we are unable to obtain and enforce patent protection forour products and product candidates, our business could be materially harmed. We have an extensiveportfolio of issued U.S. patents and filed applications, many of which have foreign counterparts.These patents, if extensions are not granted, are expected to expire beginning in 2009 through2028. Under our license agreements, we have exclusively licensed patents related to our commercialand development products. Of the patents owned or exclusively licensed by us, 7 relate toPEG-INTRON, 17 relate to Abelcet and 3 relate to DepoCyt. Our products, Oncaspar and Adagen, arenot covered by any unexpired patents. We have exclusively licensed patents from NatImmune relatedto our rhMBL product candidate and from Santaris related to our HIF-1 alpha antagonist and ourother LNA compounds in development. Although we believe that our patents provide certainprotection from competition, we cannot assure you that such patents will be of substantialprotection or commercial benefit to us, will afford us adequate protection from competing products,or will not be challenged or declared invalid. In addition, we cannot assure you that additionalU.S. patents or foreign patent equivalents will be issued to us.33Table of Contents     Issued patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. In addition, court decisionsmay introduce uncertainty in the enforceability or scope of patents owned by biotechnology andpharmaceutical companies. The legal systems of certain countries do not favor the aggressiveenforcement of patents, and the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the sameextent as the laws of the U.S. Therefore, enforceability or scope of our patents in the U.S. or inforeign countries cannot be predicted with certainty, and, as a result, any patents that we own orlicense may not provide sufficient protection against competitors. We may not be able to obtain ormaintain patent protection for our pending patent applications, those we may file in the future, orthose we may license from third parties.     While we believe that our patent rights are enforceable, we cannot assure you that any patentsthat we have issued, that we may issue or that may be licensed to us will be enforceable or validor will not expire prior to the commercialization of our product candidates, thus allowing othersto more effectively compete with us. Therefore, any patents that we own or license may notadequately protect our product candidates or our future products. If we are not able to protect ourpatent positions, our business could be materially harmed.     Other entities may have or obtain patents or proprietary rights that could limit our abilityto manufacture, use, sell, offer for sale or import products or impair our competitive position.To the extent that a third party obtains patents or proprietary rights that cover our products, wemay be required to obtain licenses to those patents or proprietary rights, which licenses may notbe available or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.     We may become aware that certain organizations are engaging in activities that infringecertain of our patents, including our PEG and single-chain antibody, or SCA, technology patents. Wecannot assure you that we will be able to enforce our patents and other rights against suchorganizations.     Legal or administrative proceedings may be necessary to defend against claims of infringementor to enforce our intellectual property rights. We have in the past been involved in patentlitigation and other proceedings and we may likely become involved in additional patent litigationor proceedings in the future. If we become involved in any such litigation or proceeding,irrespective of the outcome, we may incur substantial costs, the efforts of our technical andmanagement personnel may be diverted, and such disputes could substantially delay or prevent ourproduct development or commercialization activities, which could materially harm our business,financial condition and results of operations.     The U.S and corresponding foreign patents upon which our original PEG technology was based andcontaining broad claims covering the attachment of PEG to polypeptides in 1996. Without thatpatent protection, other parties are permitted to make, use or sell products covered by the claimsof those patents, subject to other patents, including those which we hold. We have obtainednumerous patents with claims covering improved methods of attaching or linking PEG to therapeuticcompounds. We cannot assure you that any of these patents will enable us to prevent competition orthat competitors will not develop alternative methods of attaching PEG to compounds potentiallyresulting in competitive products outside the protection that may be afforded by our patents. Weare aware that others have also filed patent applications and have been granted patents in the U.S.and other countries with respect to the application of PEG to proteins and other compounds.We or our suppliers could experience delays or difficulties in manufacturing, including problemscomplying with the FDAs regulations for manufacturing our products. These problems couldmaterially harm our business.     Manufacturers of drugs must comply with current cGMP regulations, which include qualitycontrol and quality assurance requirements as well as the corresponding maintenance of records anddocumentation. Manufacturing facilities are subject to ongoing periodic inspection by the FDA andcorresponding state agencies, including unannounced inspections of our commercial manufacturingfacilities. We or our present or future suppliers may be unable to comply with the applicable cGMPregulations and other FDA regulatory requirements.34Table of Contents     Adagen and Oncaspar, which we manufacture, use our earlier PEG technology which tends to beless stable than the PEG technology used in PEG-INTRON and our products under development. Due, inpart, to the drawbacks in the earlier technologies we have had and may continue to havemanufacturing problems with these products.     We continue to face manufacturing and stability issues with Oncaspar. To date, we have beenunable to identify the cause of these issues. If we continue to have these issues with Oncaspar, wemay have a disruption in our ability to manufacture Oncaspar. Manufacturing and stability problemshave required us to implement voluntary recalls or market withdrawals for certain batches ofOncaspar periodically since 2002 and as recently as the fourth quarter of 2006. Mandatory recallscan also take place if regulators or courts require them, even if we believe our products are safeand effective. Recalls result in lost sales of the recalled products themselves and can result infurther lost sales while replacement products are manufactured or due to customer dissatisfaction.We cannot assure you that future product recalls or market withdrawals will not materiallyadversely affect our business, our financial condition, results of operations or our reputation andrelationships with our customers. Disruption in supply or manufacturing difficulties relating toOncaspar could cause a disruption in our ability to market and sell Oncaspar and result in asubstantial loss of revenues.     The FDA and the MHRA, the British equivalent of the FDA, have conducted periodic inspectionsof our manufacturing facilities related to Abelcet, Oncaspar and Adagen. Following certain of theseinspections, the FDA has issued Form 483 reports citing deviations from cGMP, the most recent ofwhich were issued in January 2006 for our New Jersey facility and August 2005 for our Indianapolisfacility. We have responded to such reports with corrective action plans.     We are aware that the FDA has conducted inspections of certain of the manufacturing facilitiesof Schering-Plough, who manufactures PEG-INTRON, and Merck, who manufactures the L-asparaginasethat we receive from Ovation Pharmaceuticals for use in the production of Oncaspar, and thoseinspections have resulted in the issuance of Forms 483 citing deviations from cGMP.     If we or our partners face additional manufacturing problems in the future or if we or ourlicensees are unable to satisfactorily resolve current or future manufacturing problems, the FDAcould require us or our licensees to discontinue the distribution of our products or to delaycontinuation of clinical trials.Our arrangements with third-party manufacturers involve significant financial commitments and coststhat may be incurred if we terminate or delay manufacturing.     We depend on the manufacturing capabilities of third parties to manufacture drug substancesused in certain of our products. Our contractual arrangements with these manufacturers require usto commit to planned manufacturing activities. If we were to terminate or delay these activities,we may be required to pay termination fees or other delay-related charges and these amounts may besignificant. The need to terminate or delay planned manufacturing activities could arise from adelay in a clinical trial or regulatory approval, an inability to transfer our technology andcomplex processes to the third-party manufacturers or other reasons that may be beyond our control.We may be subject to a variety of types of product liability or other claims based on allegationsthat the use of our products has resulted in adverse effects, whether by participants in ourclinical trials or by patients using our products, and our insurance may not cover all productliability or other claims.     We may face liability claims related to the use or misuse of our products and productcandidates in clinical trials or in commercial use. Liability claims may be expensive to defendand may result in large judgments against us.     Although we maintain product liability insurance for claims arising from the use of ourproducts in clinical trials prior to FDA approval and for claims arising from the use of ourproducts after FDA approval at levels that we believe are appropriate, we cannot assure you that wewill35Table of Contents be ableto maintain our existing insurance coverage or obtain additional coverage on commercially reasonable terms for the useof our other products in the future. Also, our insurance coverage and our resources may not besufficient to satisfy any liability resulting from product liability claims, and a productliability claim could materially harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.     Generally,our clinical trials are conducted in patients with serious life-threatening diseasesfor whom conventional treatments have been unsuccessful, and, during the course of treatment, thesepatients could suffer adverse medical effects or die for reasons that may or may not be related toour products. Any of these events could result in a claim of liability. Any such claims againstus, regardless of their merit, could result in significant costs to defend or awards against usthat could materially harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.We depend on key personnel and may not be able to retain these employees or recruit additionalqualified personnel, which would harm our business.     Because of the specialized scientific nature of our business, we are highly dependent uponqualified scientific, technical and managerial personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer.There is intense competition for qualified personnel in the pharmaceutical field. Therefore, we maynot be able to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of ourbusiness. Although we have employment agreements with our Chief Executive Officer, Chief FinancialOfficer and Chief Scientific Officer, our ability to continue to retain such officers, as well asother senior executives or key managers is not assured. The loss of the services of one or acombination of our senior executives, particularly our Chief Executive Officer, Chief FinancialOfficer and Chief Scientific Officer, as well as the failure to recruit additional key scientific,technical and managerial personnel in a timely manner, would have an adverse effect on ourbusiness.Risks Related to Our IndustryWe face rapid technological change and intense competition, which could harm our business andresults of operations.     The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapid technological change. Our futuresuccess will depend on our ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to technologicaladvances. Rapid technological development by others may result in our products and technologiesbecoming obsolete.     We face intense competition from established biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, aswell as academic and research institutions that are pursuing competing technologies and products.We know that competitors are developing or manufacturing various products that are used for theprevention, diagnosis or treatment of diseases that we have targeted for product development. Forexample, PEG-INTRON faces increased competition from Hoffmann-La Roches Pegasys, Abelcet facesincreased competition from Astellas Pharma and Gilead Pharmaceuticals AmBisome and Three RiversPharmaceuticals Amphotec. DepoCyt competes with the generic drugs, cytarabine and methotrexate,and Oncaspar competes with ELSPAR® (asparaginase). In November 2006, the FDA acceptedan IND for OPi SA (France) for its product, Erwinase (Erwinia chryanthemi L-asparaginase).Erwinase is approved in several countries outside the U.S. for treatment of ALL. Other existingand future products, therapies and technological approaches will compete directly with ourproducts. Current and prospective competing products may provide greater therapeutic benefits for aspecific problem or may offer comparable performance at a lower cost. In addition, any productcandidate that we develop and that obtains regulatory approval must then compete for marketacceptance and market share.     Many of our competitors have substantially greater research and development capabilities andexperience and greater manufacturing, marketing and financial resources than we do. Accordingly,our competitors may develop technologies and products that are superior to those we or ourcollaborators are developing and render our technologies and products or those of our collaboratorsobsolete and noncompetitive. In addition, many of our competitors have much more experience than wedo in preclinical36Table of Contentstesting and human clinical trials of new drugs, as well as in obtaining FDA and otherregulatory approval. If we cannot compete effectively, our business and financial performance wouldsuffer.The regulatory approval process is highly uncertain and we may not successfully secure approval fornew products. Failure to obtain, or delays in obtaining, regulatory approvals could materiallyharm our business.     The marketing of pharmaceutical products in the U. S. and abroad is subject to stringentgovernmental regulation. The sale of any new products for use in humans in the U. S. requires theprior approval of the FDA. If our products are marketed abroad, they will also be subject toextensive regulation by foreign governments, whether or not we have obtained FDA approval for agiven product and its uses. The FDA has established mandatory procedures and safety standards thatapply to the clinical testing and marketing of pharmaceutical products. The FDA regulates theresearch, development, preclinical and clinical testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness,record-keeping, reporting, labeling, storage, approval, advertising, promotion, sale, distribution,import and export of pharmaceutical and biological products. Obtaining FDA approval for a newtherapeutic product may take several years and involve substantial expenditures. Compliance withthese regulations can be costly, time consuming and subject us to unanticipated delays indeveloping our products. We cannot assure you that we or our licensees will be able to obtain ormaintain FDA or other relevant marketing approval for any of our products.     Government regulation substantially increases the cost of researching, developing,manufacturing and selling our products. The regulatory review and approval process, which includespreclinical testing and clinical trials of each product candidate, is lengthy, expensive anduncertain. We must obtain regulatory approval for each product we intend to market, and themanufacturing facilities used for the products must be inspected and meet legal requirements.Securing regulatory approval requires the submission of extensive preclinical and clinical data andother supporting information for each proposed therapeutic indication in order to establish theproducts safety, efficacy, potency and purity for each intended use. The development and approvalprocess takes many years, requires substantial resources and may never lead to the approval of aproduct.     Even if we are able to obtain regulatory approval for a particular product, the approval maylimit the indicated uses for the product, may otherwise limit our ability to promote, sell anddistribute the product, may require that we conduct costly post-marketing surveillance and mayrequire that we conduct ongoing post-marketing studies. Material changes to an approved product,such as manufacturing changes or revised labeling, may require further regulatory review andapproval. Once obtained, any approvals may be withdrawn for a number of reasons, including thelater discovery of previously unknown problems with the product, such as a safety issue. If we orour contract manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements at any stageduring the regulatory process, such noncompliance could result in:  refusals or delays in the approval of applications or supplements to approvedapplications;   refusal of a regulatory authority, including the FDA, to review pending marketapproval applications or supplements to approved applications;   warning letters;   fines;   import or export restrictions;   product recalls or seizures;   injunctions;   total or partial suspension of production;   fines, civil penalties or criminal prosecutions; or   withdrawals of previously approved marketing applications or licenses.     In addition, any approved products are subject to continuing regulation. Among other things,the holder of an approved biologic license application or new drug application is subject toperiodic and other FDA monitoring and reporting obligations, including obligations to monitor andreport adverse events and instances of the failure of a product to meet the specifications in thebiologic license application or new37Table of Contentsdrug application. Application holders must also submit advertising and other promotionalmaterial to the FDA and report on ongoing clinical trials. Failure to meet these post-approvalrequirements can result in criminal prosecution, fines or other penalties, injunctions, recall orseizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, or denial or withdrawal ofpre-marketing product approvals.     Failure to obtain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions would prevent us from marketingour products abroad. In order to market our products in the European Union and many otherjurisdictions outside the U.S., we must obtain separate regulatory approvals and comply withnumerous foreign regulatory requirements. The approval procedure varies among countries and caninvolve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval may differ from that required toobtain FDA approval. The foreign regulatory approval process may include all of the risksassociated with obtaining FDA approval. We may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timelybasis, if at all. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in othercountries, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatoryauthorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA. We may not be able to file for regulatoryapprovals and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market. Thefailure to obtain these approvals could materially harm our business, financial condition andresults of operations.     If we or our licensees fail to obtain or maintain requisite governmental approvals or fail toobtain or maintain approvals of the scope requested, it will delay or preclude us or our licenseesor marketing partners from marketing our products. It could also limit the commercial use of ourproducts. Any such failure or limitation may have a material adverse effect on our business,financial condition and results of operations.Even if we obtain regulatory approval for our products, they may not be accepted in themarketplace.     Even if clinical trials demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our product candidates and allregulatory approvals are obtained, our products may not gain market acceptance among physicians,patients, third-party payors or the medical community. The degree of market acceptance will dependon many factors, including:  the scope of regulatory approvals,   establishment and demonstration of clinical efficacy and safety;   cost-effectiveness of our products;   alternative treatment methods and potentially competitive products;   the availability of third-party reimbursement     If our products do not achieve significant market acceptance, our business,financial condition and results of operations may be materially harmed.Our operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations.     Our operations are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulationsconcerning, among other things, the generation, handling, storage, transportation, treatment anddisposal of hazardous, toxic and radioactive substances and the discharge of pollutants into theair and water. Environmental permits and controls are required for some of our operations and thesepermits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation by the issuing authorities. We believethat our facilities are in substantial compliance with our permits and environmental laws andregulations and do not believe that future compliance with current environmental law will have amaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If, however,we were to become liable for an accident, or if we were to suffer an extended facility shutdown asa result of such contamination, we could incur significant costs, damages and penalties that couldharm our business.38Table of ContentsBecause of the uncertainty of pharmaceutical pricing, reimbursement and healthcare reform measures,we may be unable to sell our products profitably in the U.S.     The availability of reimbursement by governmental and other third-party payors affects themarket for any pharmaceutical product. In recent years, there have been numerous proposals tochange the healthcare system in the U.S. and further proposals are likely. Some of these proposalshave included measures that would limit or eliminate payments for medical procedures and treatmentsor subject the pricing of pharmaceuticals to government control. In addition, government andprivate third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting boththe coverage and the level of reimbursement of drug products. For example, under the MedicarePrescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act), Medicare benefits areprovided primarily through private entities that attempt to negotiate price concessions frompharmaceutical manufacturers. This may increase pressure to lower prescription drug prices. The Actalso includes other cost containment measures for Medicare in the event Medicare cost increasesexceed a certain level, which measures may impose limitations on prescription drug prices. Thesechanges in Medicare reimbursement could have a negative impact on our revenues derived from salesof our products. Moreover, significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status ofnewly-approved healthcare products.     Our ability to commercialize our products will depend, in part, on the extent to whichreimbursement for the cost of the products and related treatments will be available fromthird-party payors such as government health care programs and private health insurers. Thesethird-party payors control health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level ofreimbursement for new health care products. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging theprice and examining the cost effectiveness of medical products and services. If we or any of ourcollaborators succeed in bringing one or more products to market, we cannot assure you thatthird-party payors will establish and maintain price levels sufficient for realization of anappropriate return on our investment in product development. In addition, lifetime limits onbenefits included in most private health plans may force patients to self-pay for treatment. Forexample, patients who receive Adagen are expected to require injections for their entire lives.The cost of this treatment may exceed certain plan limits and cause patients to self-fund furthertreatment. Without reimbursement or with inadequate third-party coverage, the market for ourproducts may be limited, which could materially harm our business.     Significant changes in the healthcare system in the U.S. or elsewhere could have a materialadverse effect on our business and financial performance. In the future, the U.S. government mayinstitute price controls and further limits on Medicare and Medicaid spending. Moreover, medicalreimbursement systems vary internationally, with differing degrees of regulation. Pricing controlsand reimbursement limitations could affect the payments we receive from sales of our products.These variations could harm our ability to sell our products in commercially acceptable quantitiesat profitable prices.The law or FDA policy could change and expose us to competition from generic or follow-onversions of our products, which could adversely impact our business.     Under current U.S. law and FDA policy, generic versions of conventional chemical drugcompounds, sometimes referred to as small molecule compounds, may be approved through anabbreviated approval process. There is no abbreviated approval process under current law forbiological products approved under the Public Health Service Act through a Biologic LicenseApplication, such as monoclonal antibodies, cytokines, growth factors, enzymes, interferons andcertain other proteins. However, various proposals have been made to establish an abbreviatedapproval process to permit approval of generic or follow-on versions of these types of biologicalproducts under U.S. law, and the FDAs counterpart in the European Union has recently approved anumber of follow-on biologicals. It is not clear whether any proposed legislation on generic orfollow-on biologics will become law, or what form that law might take. However, if the law ischanged or if the FDA somehow extends its existing authority in new ways, and third parties arepermitted to obtain approvals of versions of our biological products through an abbreviatedapproval mechanism, and without conducting full clinical studies of their own, it could adverselyaffect our business.39Table of ContentsRisks Related to Our Common Stock and our Convertible NotesThe price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile, which also maysignificantly affect the trading price of our convertible notes.     Historically, the market price of our common stock has fluctuated over a wide range, and it islikely that the price of our common stock will continue to be volatile in the future. The marketprice of our common stock could be impacted due to a variety of factors, including, in addition toglobal and industry-wide events:  the level of revenues we generate from our sale of products and royalties wereceive;   the losses we incur or the profits we generate;   the results of preclinical testing and clinical trials by us, our collaborativepartners or our competitors;   announcements of technical innovations or new products by us, our collaborativepartners or our competitors;   the status of corporate collaborations and supply arrangements;   regulatory approvals;   developments in patent or other proprietary rights;   public concern as to the safety and efficacy of products developed by us orothers; and   litigation.     In addition, due to one or more of the foregoing factors in one or more future quarters, ourresults of operations may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In thatevent, the market price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected. Volatilityin the price of our common stock may significantly affect the trading price of our convertiblenotes.Events with respect to our share capital could cause the shares of our common stock outstanding toincrease.     Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the open market, or the availability ofsuch shares for sale, could adversely affect the price of our common stock. We had approximately44.2 million shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2007. As of that date, thefollowing securities that may be exercised for, or are convertible into, shares of our common stockwere outstanding:  Options. Stock options to purchase 8.4 million shares of our common stock at aweighted average exercise price of approximately $11.36 per share;   4% convertible senior notes due 2013 (the 2013 convertible notes). Our 2013convertible notes may be converted into 28.8 million shares of our common stock ata conversion price of $9.55 per share.   Restricted stock units. 1.8 million shares of our common stock issuable inrespect of outstanding restricted stock units held by officers, employees anddirectors.     The shares of our common stock that may be issued under the options, restricted stock units,and the 2013 convertible notes are currently registered with the Securities and ExchangeCommission, and, therefore, those shares of common stock that may be issued will be eligible forpublic resale.     The conversion of some or all of the convertible notes will dilute the ownership interests ofexisting stockholders. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon suchconversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, theexistence of the notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion ofthe notes could depress the price of our common stock.40Table of Contents     As of December 31, 2007, we also had outstanding our 4.5% convertible subordinated notes due2008 that may be converted into 1.0 million shares of our common stock. However, the conversionprice for these notes is $70.98 per share, which makes their conversion highly unlikely.Anti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law may make it more difficultto acquire us, even though such acquisitions may be beneficial to our stockholders.     Provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delawarelaw, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even though such acquisitionsmay be beneficial to our stockholders. These anti-takeover provisions include:  a classified board of directors whereby not all members of the board may beelected at onetime;   lack of a provision for cumulative voting in the election of directors, which wouldotherwiseallow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates;   the ability of our board to authorize the issuance of blank check preferred stock toincreasethe number of outstanding shares and thwart a takeover attempt;   advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or forproposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and   limitations on who may call a special meeting of stockholders.     Further, we have in place a stockholder rights plan, commonly known as a poison pill. Theprovisions described above, our stockholder rights plan and provisions of Delaware law relating tobusiness combinations with interested stockholders may discourage, delay or prevent a third partyfrom acquiring us. These provisions may also discourage, delay or prevent a third party fromacquiring a large portion of our securities, or initiating a tender offer, even if our stockholdersmight receive a premium for their shares in the acquisition over the then current market price. Wealso have agreements with our executive officers that provide for change of control severancebenefits which provides for cash severance, restricted stock and option award vesting accelerationand other benefits in the event our employees are terminated (or, in some cases, resign forspecified reasons) following an acquisition. These agreements could discourage a third party fromacquiring us.The issuance of preferred stock may adversely affect rights of common stockholders.     Under our certificate of incorporation, our board of directors has the authority to issue upto three million shares of blank check preferred stock and to determine the price, rights,preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by our stockholders.The rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to the rights of the holders of anyshares of preferred stock that may be issued in the future. In addition to discouraging atakeover, as discussed above, this blank check preferred stock may have rights, includingeconomic rights senior to the common stock, and, as a result, the issuance of such preferred stockcould have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock.We may be unable to redeem our 2013 convertible notes upon a fundamental change.     We may be unable to redeem the 2013 convertible notes in the event of a fundamental change, asdefined in the related indenture. Upon a fundamental change, holders of the 2013 convertible notesmay require us to redeem all or a portion of the 2013 convertible notes. If a fundamental changewere to occur, we may not have enough funds to pay the redemption price for all tendered 2013convertible notes. Any future credit agreements or other agreements relating to our indebtednessmay contain similar provisions, or expressly prohibit the repurchase of the 2013 convertible notesupon a fundamental change or may provide that a fundamental change constitutes an event of defaultunder that agreement. If a fundamental change occurs at a time when we are prohibited frompurchasing or redeeming 2013 convertible notes, we could seek the consent of our lenders to redeemthe 2013 convertible notes or could attempt to refinance this debt. If we do not obtain a consent,we41Table of Contents could notpurchase or redeem the 2013 convertible notes. Our failure to redeem tendered 2013 convertible notes would constitute an event of default under theindenture governing the 2013 convertible notes.     The term fundamental change is limited to certain specified transactions as defined in theindenture governing the 2013 convertible notes and may not include other events that mightadversely affect our financial condition or the market value of the 2013 convertible notes or ourcommon stock. Our obligation to offer to redeem the 2013 convertible notes upon a fundamentalchange would not necessarily afford holders of the 2013 convertible notes protection in the eventof a highly leveraged transaction, reorganization, merger or similar transaction involving us.The market for unrated debt is subject to disruptions that could have an adverse effect on themarket price of the 2013 convertible notes, or a market for our notes may fail to develop or besustained.     The 2013 convertible notes are not rated. As a result, holders of the notes have the risksassociated with an investment in unrated debt. Historically, the market for unrated debt has beensubject to disruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of such securities andgreatly reduced liquidity for the holders of such securities. If the notes are traded, they maytrade at a discount from their initial offering price, depending on, among other things, prevailinginterest rates, the markets for similar securities, general economic conditions and our financialcondition, results of operations and prospects. The liquidity of, and trading markets for, thenotes also may be adversely affected by general declines in the market for unrated debt. Suchdeclines may adversely affect the liquidity of, and trading markets for, the notes, independent ofour financial performance or prospects. In addition, certain regulatory restrictions prohibitcertain types of financial institutions from investing in unrated debt, which may further suppressdemand for such securities. We cannot assure you that the market for the notes will not be subjectto similar disruptions or that any market for our notes will develop or be sustained. Any suchdisruptions may have an adverse effect on the holders of the notes.We may not have sufficient funds available to pay amounts due under our 2013 convertible notes.     We may not have sufficient funds available or may be unable to arrange for additionalfinancing to satisfy our obligations under our 2013 notes. Our ability to pay cash to holders ofthe notes or meet our payment and other debt obligations depends on our ability to generatesignificant cash flow in the future. This, to some extent, is subject to general economic,financial, competitive, legislative and regulatory factors, as well as other factors that arebeyond our control. Also, the indenture governing our 2013 convertible notes does not contain anyfinancial or operating covenants or restrictions on the payments of dividends, the incurrence ofindebtedness or the issuance or repurchase of securities by us or any of our subsidiaries. Wecannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations, or that futureborrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our paymentobligations under the notes and our other obligations and to fund other liquidity needs.42Table of Contents"
6,ENZN,ENZON PHARMACEUTICALS INC,2007-03-02,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors     Throughout this Annual Report on    Form 10-K,    we have made forward-looking statements in an attempt to better    enable the reader to understand our future prospects and make    informed judgments. By their nature, forward-looking statements    are subject to numerous factors that may influence outcomes or    even prevent their eventual realization. Such factors may be    external to Enzon and entirely outside our control.     We cannot guarantee that our assumptions and expectations will    be correct. Failure of events to be achieved or of certain    underlying assumptions to prove accurate could cause actual    results to vary materially from past results and those    anticipated or projected. We do not intend to update    forward-looking statements.     Certain risks and uncertainties are discussed below. It is not    possible to predict or identify all such factors, however.    Accordingly, you should not consider this recitation to be    complete. Risks    Related to Our Business     If any of these risks are realized our business, prospects,    financial condition, results of operations and our ability to    service debt could be materially adversely affected. We    expect to incur losses over the next several    years.     As of December 31, 2006, we had an accumulated deficit of    approximately $382.6 million. In the past, we have incurred    net losses. For example, during the six-month period ended    December 31, 2005 and the fiscal year ended June 30,    2005, we incurred net losses of $291.3 million and    $89.6 million, respectively. Our net loss in the six-month    period ended December 31, 2005 was primarily attributable    to a write-off of goodwill and a write-down of intangible assets    associated with our acquisition of Abelcet in 2002. Our net loss    in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005 was primarily the    result of lower sales of Abelcet and a $78.0 million charge    we incurred to increase our valuation allowance associated with    our deferred tax assets based upon our assessment that it was    more likely than not that we would not benefit from these assets.     Our ability to achieve long-term profitability will depend    primarily on:           the success of our research and development programs;           the continued sales of our marketed products and the products on    which we receive royalties; and           our and our licensees ability to develop and obtain    regulatory approvals for additional product candidates.     We expect to incur losses over the next several years, including    for the year ending December 31, 2007, as we expect to make    significant research and development expenditures. Our    financial results are heavily dependent on the continued sales    of our marketed products and the products on which we receive    royalties; if revenues from these products fail to increase or    materially decline, our results of operations, financial    position and prospects will be materially harmed.     Our results of operations are heavily dependent on the revenues    we derive from the sale and marketing of    PEG-INTRON    marketed by Schering Plough that incorporates our PEG technology    and for which we receive royalties, and our marketed products,    including Oncaspar, DepoCyt, Adagen and Abelcet. In addition, we    expect these products will account for a significant portion of    our future revenues. As a consequence of the significant portion    of our revenues derived from these products, the stagnation or    decline in the sales of one or more of these products could    adversely affect our operating results, financial position and    prospects. Sales of these products can be affected by, among    other things, competition, patient demand, and manufacturing    issues.     We cannot assure you that Schering-Plough will continue to be    successful in marketing PEG-INTRON. The amount and timing of    resources dedicated by Schering-Plough to the marketing of    PEG-INTRON is not within our control. If Schering-Plough    breaches or terminates its agreement with us, the sale of    PEG-INTRON could be slowed    26Table of Contents    or blocked completely. Our revenues will be negatively affected    if Schering-Plough cannot meet the marketing or manufacturing    demands of the market. Sales    of PEG-INTRON and Abelcet have been adversely affected by    competitive products introduced into their respective markets    and we have experienced in the past and may continue to    experience in the future a decline in sales of Abelcet, which if    not reversed, will adversely affect our results of operations,    financial condition and prospects.     Products that compete with both PEG-INTRON and Abelcet have been    and potentially will be introduced by other drug manufacturers    into their respective markets.     Hoffman-LaRoches Pegasys, a competing PEGylated    interferon-based combination therapy, has resulted in    significant competitive pressure on PEG-INTRON sales in the    United States and all international markets. Pegasys has taken    market share away from PEG-INTRON and the overall market for    PEGylated alpha-interferon for the treatment of hepatitis C    has been contracting. As a result, sales of PEG-INTRON in    certain markets where it competes with Pegasys and the royalties    we receive on those sales have declined. We cannot assure you    that Pegasys will not continue to gain market share at the    expense of PEG-INTRON which could result in lower PEG-INTRON    sales and lower royalties to us. Hoffmann-LaRoche reported that    they expect approval in Japan for Pegasys combination therapy.    The launch in Japan of Pegasys is expected to have a negative    impact on PEG-INTRONs Japanese market share and sales.     Similarly, the continued sale of newer products from Merck,    Pfizer, Schering-Plough and Astellas Pharma in the antifungal    market (where Abelcet competes) has negatively impacted Abelcet    sales as clinicians utilize these other therapeutic agents.    Pfizer and Schering-Plough have each recently obtained approval    for an additional new product in the antifungal market that is    expected to further increase competition. In addition, Astellas    Pharma and Gilead Sciences, Inc. are currently marketing    AmBisome, and Three Rivers Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is marketing    Amphotec, each of which is a lipid-based version of amphotericin    B, for the treatment of fungal infections. AmBisome and Amphotec    each compete with Abelcet which has resulted in greater    competitive pressure on Abelcet sales. During calendar year    2006, we continued to experience increasing pricing pressure    with respect to Abelcet. In particular, Astellas Pharma and    Gilead Sciences, Inc., have aggressively lowered the price of    their product in certain regions and for certain customers in    the United States. This has resulted in the shrinkage or loss of    certain of our customer accounts. While we are developing and    implementing strategies to address the competitive threats    facing Abelcet, we cannot assure you that we will be able to    increase sales of Abelcet or prevent further decreases in    Abelcet sales. If we are not successful in addressing the    competitive threats, it could adversely affect our operating    results, financial condition and prospects. Significant    indebtedness may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability    to repay or repurchase our 2013 convertible notes and 2008    convertible notes.     As of December 31, 2006, we had $397.6 million of    outstanding indebtedness, primarily related to our outstanding    2013 convertible notes and 2008 convertible notes. Our    significant debt level could have important negative    consequences, including:           increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and    industry conditions;           limiting our ability to obtain additional financing;           requiring the dedication of a substantial portion of our    expected cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness,    thereby reducing the amount of our expected cash flow available    for other purposes, including capital expenditures;           limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to,    changes in our business and the industry in which we compete;           placing us at a possible competitive disadvantage relative to    less leveraged competitors and competitors that have better    access to capital resources; and    27Table of Contents           making it difficult or impossible for us to pay the principal    amount of the notes at maturity, the interest on or the    repurchase price of the notes upon a fundamental change, thereby    causing an event of default under the indenture.     In addition, the notes are our obligation exclusively. We may    have difficulty paying what we owe under the notes if we or our    subsidiaries incur additional indebtedness or other liabilities. We    depend on our collaborative partners; if we lose our    collaborative partners or they do not apply adequate resources    to our collaborations, our product development and financial    performance may suffer.     We rely and will depend heavily in the future on collaborations    with partners, primarily pharmaceutical and biotechnology    companies, for one or more of the research, development,    manufacturing, marketing and other commercialization activities    relating to most of our product candidates. If we lose our    collaborative partners, or if they do not apply adequate    resources to our collaborations, our product development and    financial performance may suffer.     The amount and timing of resources dedicated by our    collaborators to their collaborations with us is not within our    control. If any collaborator breaches or terminates its    agreements with us, or fails to conduct its collaborative    activities in a timely manner, the commercialization of our    product candidates could be slowed or blocked completely. We    cannot assure you that our collaborative partners will not    change their strategic focus or pursue alternative technologies    or develop alternative products as a means for developing    treatments for the diseases targeted by these collaborative    programs. Our collaborators could develop competing products.     We cannot assure you that our collaborations will be successful.    Disputes may arise between us and our collaborators as to a    variety of matters, including financing obligations under our    agreements and ownership of intellectual property rights. These    disputes may be both expensive and time-consuming and may result    in delays in the development and commercialization of products.    If any of the product candidates that we are commercializing    with collaborators are delayed or stopped from coming to market    or we experience increased costs as a result of our relationship    with our collaborators, our financial performance could be    adversely affected. We    will need to obtain additional financing to meet our future    capital needs and our failure to do so could materially and    adversely affect our business, financial condition and    operations.     Our current development projects and marketing initiatives    require substantial capital. We believe that our current cash,    cash equivalents and investments and our anticipated cash flow    from operations will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs    for the near future, but we will likely need to increase our    cash flow from operations or obtain financing to meet our future    capital needs, which we expect will be substantial. We will    require substantial additional funds to conduct research    activities, preclinical studies, clinical trials and other    activities relating to the successful commercialization of    potential products. In addition, we may seek to acquire    additional products, technologies and companies, which could    require substantial capital. The competitive pressures impacting    PEG-INTRON    and Abelcet may cause our cash flow from operations to decrease    rather than increase in the future and we cannot be sure that    additional funds from other sources will be available on    commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If adequate funds are    unavailable from operations or additional sources of financing,    we may have to delay, reduce the scope of or eliminate one or    more of our research or development programs or one or more of    our potential acquisitions of technologies or companies, which    could materially and adversely affect our business, financial    condition and operations.     As of December 31, 2006, we had $122.6 million of our    2008 4.5% convertible subordinated notes outstanding. The notes    will mature on July 1, 2008 unless earlier converted,    redeemed at our option, or redeemed at the option of the    noteholder upon a default by us or fundamental change, each as    described in the indenture for the notes. We will be required to    repay the notes at maturity unless we can refinance the debt.    Noteholders are very unlikely to convert their notes into common    stock before the maturity date. We expect that we will need to    refinance or obtain new financing to pay at least a portion of    the principal amount of these notes. We currently are    considering financing alternatives; however, we cannot be    certain that any of such financing alternatives will be    consummated on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.    28Table of Contents     We may seek to raise any necessary additional funds through    equity or debt financings, collaborative arrangements with    corporate partners or other sources which may be dilutive to    existing stockholders. We cannot assure you that we will be able    to obtain additional funds on commercially reasonable terms, if    at all. We    purchase some of the compounds utilized in our products from a    single source or a limited group of suppliers, and the partial    or complete loss of one of these suppliers could cause    production delays and a substantial loss of    revenues.     We purchase the unmodified compounds and bulk PEGs utilized in    our approved products and products under development from    outside suppliers. In some cases, we have a limited number of    suppliers. Moreover, in some cases, we have no supply agreement.    Specifically, our ability to obtain compounds for our respective    products may be limited by the following factors. Oncaspar.  We have supply agreements with    Ovation Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Kyowa Hakko to produce the    unmodified forms of L-asparaginase, the active ingredient used    in the production of Oncaspar. Our agreement with Ovation    Pharmaceuticals, Inc. provides for Ovation to supply    L-asparaginase to us through 2009. We have committed to    effectuate a technology transfer of the cell line and    manufacturing of the L-asparaginase to our own supplier by    December 31, 2009, and then supply L-asparaginase back to    Ovation during the years    2010-2012.    It is possible that we will not be able to successfully complete    the technology transfer by the deadline or at all due to    technological, manufacturing, regulatory or other issues. If we    are unable to effectuate the technology transfer by the    deadline, we may not be able to manufacture or sell Oncaspar,    which would result in a substantial loss of revenues. Also, if    we are unable to supply L-asparaginase back to Ovation during    the years    2010-2012,    we could be required to pay damages to Ovation in connection    with a breach of our obligation to supply them. Adagen.  We purchase the unmodified adenosine    deaminase enzyme used in the manufacturing of Adagen from Roche    Diagnostics. Roche Diagnostics, which is based in Germany, and    is the only FDA-approved supplier of the adenosine deaminase    enzyme, or ADA, used in Adagen. During 2002 we obtained FDA    approval of the use of the ADA enzyme obtained from bovine    intestines from cattle of New Zealand origin. New Zealand    currently certifies that its cattle are bovine spongiform    encephalopathy (BSE or mad cow disease) free. Beginning in    September 2002, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)    required all animal-sourced materials shipped to the United    States from any European country to contain a veterinary    certificate that the product is BSE free, regardless of the    country of origin. Our ADA supply agreement with Roche    Diagnostics terminated in 2004 although we are still receiving    our supply of ADA from them. We are currently seeking to develop    a recombinant ADA as an alternative to the naturally-derived    bovine product. This is a difficult and expensive undertaking as    to which success cannot be assured. Roche Diagnostics continues    to supply us with our requirements of ADA and indicated when    they terminated the supply agreement that they will continue to    do so for a reasonable period of time as we work to develop    another source of ADA. We may have little or no notice if Roche    Diagnostics decides to stop supplying us with ADA. If we are    unable to secure an alternative source of ADA before Roche    Diagnostics discontinues supplying the material to us, we will    likely experience inventory shortages and potentially a period    of product unavailability or a long-term inability to produce    Adagen. If this occurs, it will have a measurable (and    potentially material) negative impact on our business and    results of operations and it could potentially result in    significant reputational harm and regulatory difficulties. Abelcet.  We have two suppliers that produce    the amphotericin B used in the manufacture of Abelcet,    Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) and Alpharma A.p.S. Our supply    agreement with BMS terminated on March 1, 2006, and we do    not have a supply agreement with Alpharma. We are currently    still receiving supply of amphotericin B from BMS, and Alpharma    may provide an alternate source in the future, although there    can be no assurance they will provide us with amphotericin B.    Additionally, we are seeking to qualify at least one additional    source of supply. The termination of our supply agreement by BMS    may give rise to future increased costs for the acquisition of    amphotericin B, as well as increased capital expenditures    related to readying a new suppliers facilities for cGMP,    and obtaining production and regulatory approval of Abelcet    incorporating the alternative amphotericin B. Although there can    be no assurance as to the timing of these increased costs and    additional capital expenditures, we anticipate that these may be    incurred beginning in calendar year 2007.    29Table of Contents     If we experience a delay in obtaining or are unable to obtain    any compound for any of the products discussed above on    reasonable terms, or at all, it could have a material adverse    effect on our business, financial condition and results of    operations. No assurance can be given that in any case    alternative suppliers with appropriate regulatory authorizations    could be readily identified if necessary. If we experience    delays in obtaining or are unable to obtain any such compounds    on reasonable terms, it could have a material adverse effect on    our business, financial condition and results of operations.     If we are required to obtain an alternate source for an    unmodified compound utilized in a product, the FDA and relevant    foreign regulatory agencies will likely require that we perform    additional testing to demonstrate that the alternate material is    biologically and chemically equivalent to the unmodified    compound previously used in our clinical trials. This testing    could delay or stop development of a product, limit commercial    sales of an approved product and cause us to incur significant    additional expenses. If we are unable to demonstrate that the    alternate material is chemically and biologically equivalent to    the previously used unmodified compound, we will likely be    required to repeat some or all of the preclinical and clinical    trials conducted for the compound. The marketing of an FDA    approved drug could be disrupted while such tests are conducted.    Even if the alternate material is shown to be chemically and    biologically equivalent to the previously used compound, the FDA    or relevant foreign regulatory agency may require that we    conduct additional clinical trials with the alternate material. There    is a high risk that early-stage research and development might    not generate successful product candidates.     At the present time the vast majority of our research and    development operations are focused on the early stages of    product research and development, and we are first commencing    clinical trials on our product development candidates. The    research and development of pharmaceutical products is subject    to high risk of failure. Most product development candidates    fail to reach the market. Our success depends on the    identification of new drugs or modified forms of existing drugs    that we can successfully develop and commercialize. We do not    expect any of the drugs resulting from our current research and    development efforts to be commercially available for several    years, if at all. In order to fill our pipeline of product    candidates under development, we may attempt to acquire rights    to products under development by other companies. The    competition for the acquisition of rights to products that are    viewed as viable candidates for successful development and    commercialization is intense, and we will be competing for such    opportunities with many companies with resources that are    substantially greater than ours. In addition, our potential    products are subject to risks of failure inherent in the    development of new pharmaceutical products. These risks include,    but are not limited to, risks that the drug might prove    ineffective or may cause harmful side-effects during    pre-clinical testing or clinical trials, may fail to receive    necessary regulatory approvals, cannot be manufactured on a    commercial scale basis and therefore may not be economical to    produce, may fail to achieve market acceptance or that we may be    precluded from commercialization by proprietary rights of third    parties. Our    product candidates must undergo extensive clinical testing, the    results of which are uncertain and could substantially delay or    prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval.     Before we can obtain regulatory approval for a product    candidate, we must undertake extensive clinical testing in    humans to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of    the FDA. Clinical trials of new product candidates sufficient to    obtain regulatory marketing approval are expensive and take    years to complete, and the outcome of these trials is uncertain.    Clinical development of any product candidate that we determine    to take into clinical trials may be delayed or prevented at any    time for some or all of the following reasons:           negative or ambiguous results regarding the efficacy of the    product candidate;           undesirable side effects that delay or extend the trials or make    the product candidate not medically or commercially viable;           inability to recruit and qualify a sufficient number of patients    for our trials;           regulatory delays or other regulatory actions, including changes    in regulatory requirements;           difficulties in obtaining sufficient quantities of the product    candidate manufactured under current good manufacturing    practices;    30Table of Contents           delays, suspension or termination of the trials imposed by us,    an independent institutional review board for a clinical trial    site, or clinical holds placed upon the trials by the    FDA; and           we may have inadequate financial resources to fund these trials.     Also, our development programs in the early clinical or    preclinical phases. Our future success depends, in part, on our    ability to select successful product candidates, complete    preclinical development of these product candidates and advance    them to clinical trials. Our preclinical programs may not lead    to clinical programs if we fail to identify promising product    candidates or our product candidates fail to be safe and    effective in preclinical tests. The results of preclinical and    Phase I and Phase II clinical studies are not    necessarily indicative of whether a product will demonstrate    safety and efficacy in larger patient populations, as evaluated    in Phase III clinical trials.     From time to time, we may establish and announce certain    development goals for our product candidates and programs;    however, given the complex nature of the drug discovery and    development process, it is difficult to predict accurately if    and when we will achieve these goals. If we are unsuccessful in    advancing our preclinical programs into clinical testing or in    obtaining regulatory approval, our long-term business prospects    will be harmed.     We rely and will continue to rely on clinical investigators,    academic institutions, third-party contract research    organizations and consultants to perform some or all of the    functions associated with preclinical testing or clinical    trials. While we rely heavily on these parties for successful    execution of our clinical trials, we do not control many aspects    of their activities. The failure of any of these parties to    perform in an acceptable and timely manner, including in    accordance with any applicable regulatory requirements, such as    good clinical and laboratory practices, or preclinical testing    or clinical trial protocols, could cause a delay or otherwise    adversely affect our preclinical testing or clinical trials and    ultimately the timely advancement of our development programs.    We also depend upon third party manufacturers to qualify for FDA    approval and to comply with good manufacturing practices    required by regulators. The failure of our manufacturers and    suppliers to comply with current good manufacturing practices    may result in the delay or termination of clinical studies.     A delay in or termination of any of our clinical development    programs could have an adverse effect on our business. We    depend on patents and proprietary rights, which may offer only    limited protection against potential infringement and the    development by our competitors of competitive products. The U.S.    and foreign patents upon which our original PEG technology was    based have expired.     The pharmaceutical industry places considerable importance on    obtaining patent and trade secret protection for new    technologies, products and processes. Our success depends, in    part, on our ability to develop and maintain a strong patent    position for our products and technologies both in the United    States and in other countries. We have an extensive portfolio of    issued U.S. patents and filed applications many of which    have foreign counterparts. These patents, if extensions are not    granted, are expected to expire beginning in 2007 through 2023.    Under our license agreements, we have access to large portions    of Micromet AGs patent estate as well as a small number of    individually licensed patents. Of the patents owned or    exclusively licensed by us, 7 relate to PEG-INTRON,    17 relate to Abelcet and 3 relate to DepoCyt. Although we    believe that our patents provide certain protection from    competition for Abelcet and DepoCyt, we cannot assure you that    such patents will be of substantial protection or commercial    benefit to us, will afford us adequate protection from competing    products, or will not be challenged or declared invalid. In    addition, we cannot assure you that additional U.S. patents    or foreign patent equivalents will be issued to us. The scope of    patent claims for biotechnological inventions is uncertain and    our patents and patent applications are subject to this    uncertainty.     In September 2006, we gave notice to Nektar of our intention not    to renew the provisions of our agreement with Nektar that gives    Nektar the right to    sub-license    a portion of our PEG technology and patents to third parties.    This right terminated as of January 2007 and will not affect any    existing    sub-licenses    granted by Nektar.     We may become aware that certain organizations are engaging in    activities that infringe certain of our PEG and single-chain    antibody, or SCA, technology patents. We cannot assure you that    we will be able to enforce our patent and other rights against    such organizations.    31Table of Contents     We expect that there will continue to be significant litigation    in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries regarding    patents and other proprietary rights. We have in the past been    involved in patent litigation and we may likely become involved    in additional patent litigation in the future. We may incur    substantial costs in asserting any patent rights and in    defending suits against us related to intellectual property    rights. Such disputes could substantially delay or prevent our    product development or commercialization activities and could    have a material adverse effect on our business, financial    condition and results of operations.     The U.S and corresponding foreign patents upon which our    original PEG technology was based and containing broad claims    covering the attachment of PEG to polypeptides in 1996. Without    that patent protection, other parties are permitted to make, use    or sell products covered by the claims of those patents, subject    to other patents, including those which we hold. We have    obtained numerous patents with claims covering improved methods    of attaching or linking PEG to therapeutic compounds. We cannot    assure you that any of these patents will enable us to prevent    competition or that competitors will not develop alternative    methods of attaching PEG to compounds potentially resulting in    competitive products outside the protection that may be afforded    by our patents. We are aware that others have also filed patent    applications and have been granted patents in the United States    and other countries with respect to the application of PEG to    proteins and other compounds. We or    our suppliers could experience delays or difficulties in    manufacturing, including problems complying with the FDAs    regulations for manufacturing our products. These problems could    materially harm our business.     Manufacturers of drugs must comply with current cGMP    regulations, which include quality control and quality assurance    requirements as well as the corresponding maintenance of records    and documentation. Manufacturing facilities are subject to    ongoing periodic inspection by the FDA and corresponding state    agencies, including unannounced inspections of our commercial    manufacturing facilities. We or our present or future suppliers    may be unable to comply with the applicable cGMP regulations and    other FDA regulatory requirements.     Adagen and Oncaspar, which we manufacture, use our earlier PEG    technology which tends to be less stable than the PEG technology    used in PEG-INTRON and our products under development. Due, in    part, to the drawbacks in the earlier technologies we have had    and may continue to have manufacturing problems with these    products.     We continue to face manufacturing and stability issues with    Oncaspar. To date, we have been unable to identify the cause of    these issues. If we continue to have these issues with Oncaspar,    we may have a disruption in our ability to manufacture Oncaspar.    Manufacturing and stability problems have required us to    implement voluntary recalls or market withdrawals for certain    batches of Oncaspar periodically since 2002 and as recently as    the fourth quarter of 2006. Mandatory recalls can also take    place if regulators or courts require them, even if we believe    our products are safe and effective. Recalls result in lost    sales of the recalled products themselves and can result in    further lost sales while replacement products are manufactured    or due to customer dissatisfaction. We cannot assure you that    future product recalls or market withdrawals will not materially    adversely affect our business, our financial conditions, results    of operations or our reputation and relationships with our    customers. Disruption in supply or manufacturing difficulties    relating to Oncaspar could cause a disruption in our ability to    market and sell Oncaspar and result in a substantial loss of    revenues.     The FDA and the MHRA, the British equivalent of the FDA, have    conducted periodic inspections of our manufacturing facilities    related to Abelcet, Oncaspar and Adagen. Following certain of    these inspections, the FDA has issued Form 483 reports    citing deviations from cGMP, the most recent of which were    issued in January 2006 for our New Jersey facility and August    2005 for our Indianapolis facility. We have responded to such    reports with corrective action plans.     We are aware that the FDA has conducted inspections of certain    of the manufacturing facilities of Schering-Plough, who    manufactures PEG-INTRON, and Merck, who manufactures the    L-asparaginase that we receive from Ovation Pharmaceuticals for    use in the production of Oncaspar, and those inspections have    resulted in the issuance of Forms 483 citing deviations    from cGMP.    32Table of Contents     If we or our partners face additional manufacturing problems in    the future or if we or our licensees are unable to    satisfactorily resolve current or future manufacturing problems,    the FDA could require us or our licensees to discontinue the    distribution of our products or to delay continuation of    clinical trials. We    depend on key personnel and may not be able to retain these    employees or recruit additional qualified personnel, which would    harm our business.     Because of the specialized scientific nature of our business, we    are highly dependent upon qualified scientific, technical and    managerial personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer.    There is intense competition for qualified personnel in the    pharmaceutical field. Therefore, we may not be able to attract    and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development    of our business. Although we have employment agreements with our    Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chief    Scientific Officer, our ability to continue to retain such    officers, as well as other senior executives or key managers is    not assured. The loss of the services of one or a combination of    our senior executives, particularly our Chief Executive Officer,    Chief Financial Officer and Chief Scientific Officer, as well as    the failure to recruit additional key scientific, technical and    managerial personnel in a timely manner, would have an adverse    effect on our business. Risks    Related to Our Industry We    face rapid technological change and intense competition, which    could harm our business and results of operations.     The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapid    technological change. Our future success will depend on our    ability to maintain a competitive position with respect to    technological advances. Rapid technological development by    others may result in our products and technologies becoming    obsolete.     We face intense competition from established biotechnology and    pharmaceutical companies, as well as academic and research    institutions that are pursuing competing technologies and    products. We know that competitors are developing or    manufacturing various products that are used for the prevention,    diagnosis or treatment of diseases that we have targeted for    product development. For example, PEG-INTRON faces increased    competition from Hoffman LaRoches Pegasys, Abelcet faces    increased competition from Astellas Pharma and Gilead    Pharmaceuticals AmBisome and Three Rivers    Pharmaceuticals Amphotec. DepoCyt competes with the    generic drugs, cytarabine and methotrexate, and Oncaspar    competes with    ELSPAR®    (asparaginase). Other existing and future products, therapies    and technological approaches will compete directly with our    products. Current and prospective competing products may provide    greater therapeutic benefits for a specific problem or may offer    comparable performance at a lower cost. In addition, any product    candidate that we develop and that obtains regulatory approval    must then compete for market acceptance and market share.     Many of our competitors have substantially greater research and    development capabilities and experience and greater    manufacturing, marketing and financial resources than we do.    Accordingly, our competitors may develop technologies and    products that are superior to those we or our collaborators are    developing and render our technologies and products or those of    our collaborators obsolete and noncompetitive. In addition, many    of our competitors have much more experience than we do in    preclinical testing and human clinical trials of new drugs, as    well as in obtaining FDA and other regulatory approval. If we    cannot compete effectively, our business and financial    performance would suffer. We and    our licensees are subject to extensive regulation. Compliance    with these regulations can be costly, time consuming and subject    us to unanticipated delays in developing our products. The    regulatory approval process is highly uncertain and we may not    successfully secure approval for new products.     The marketing of pharmaceutical products in the United States    and abroad is subject to stringent governmental regulation. The    sale of any new products for use in humans in the United States    will require the prior approval of the FDA. Similar approvals by    comparable agencies are required in most foreign countries. The    FDA has established mandatory procedures and safety standards    that apply to the clinical testing and marketing of    pharmaceutical products. Obtaining FDA approval for a new    therapeutic product may take several years and involve    substantial    33Table of Contents    expenditures. We cannot assure you that we or our licensees will    be able to obtain or maintain FDA or other relevant marketing    approval for any of our products.     In addition, any approved products are subject to continuing    regulation. If we or our licensees fail to comply with    applicable requirements, it could result in penalties, fines,    recalls or other injunctive or oversight remedies.     If we or our licensees fail to obtain or maintain requisite    governmental approvals or fail to obtain or maintain approvals    of the scope requested, it will delay or preclude us or our    licensees or marketing partners from marketing our products. It    could also limit the commercial use of our products. Any such    failure or limitation may have a material adverse effect on our    business, financial condition and results of operations.     In some cases, FDA approval may be provisional. For example, our    product DepoCyt was approved under the Accelerated Approval    regulations of Subpart H of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act.    These regulations are intended to make promising products for    life-threatening diseases available to the market on the basis    of preliminary evidence prior to formal demonstration of patient    benefit. Approvals granted under Subpart H are provisional and    require a written commitment to complete post-approval clinical    studies that formally demonstrate patient benefit. Our licensor,    SkyePharma, is responsible for conducting the required study. If    the FDA determines that such post-approval clinical study fails    to demonstrate patient benefit, the registration for DepoCyt may    be subject to withdrawal. Even    if we obtain regulatory approval for our products, they may not    be accepted in the marketplace.     The commercial success of our products will depend upon their    acceptance by the medical community and third-party payors as    clinically useful, cost-effective and safe. Even if our products    obtain regulatory approval, we cannot assure you that they will    achieve market acceptance of any kind. The degree of market    acceptance will depend on many factors, including:           the receipt, timing and scope of regulatory approvals,           the timing of market entry in comparison with potentially    competitive products,           the availability of third-party reimbursement, and           the establishment and demonstration in the medical community of    the clinical safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness of drug    candidates, as well as their advantages over existing    technologies and therapeutics.     If any of our products do not achieve market acceptance, we will    likely lose our entire investment in that product, giving rise    to a material adverse effect on our business, financial    condition and results of operations. Our    operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and    regulations.     Our operations are subject to federal, state and local    environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other    things, the generation, handling, storage, transportation,    treatment and disposal of hazardous, toxic and radioactive    substances and the discharge of pollutants into the air and    water. Environmental permits and controls are required for some    of our operations and these permits are subject to modification,    renewal and revocation by the issuing authorities. We believe    that our facilities are in substantial compliance with our    permits and environmental laws and regulations and do not    believe that future compliance with current environmental law    will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial    condition or results of operations. If, however, we were to    become liable for an accident, or if we were to suffer an    extended facility shutdown as a result of such contamination, we    could incur significant costs, damages and penalties that could    harm our business. We may    be subject to a variety of types of product liability or other    claims based on allegations that the use of our products has    resulted in adverse effects, whether by participants in our    clinical trials or by patients using our products, and there is    no assurance that our insurance will cover all product liability    or other claims.     Although we maintain product liability insurance for claims    arising from the use of our products in clinical trials prior to    FDA approval and for claims arising from the use of our products    after FDA approval at levels that we    34Table of Contents    believe are appropriate, we cannot assure you that we will be    able to maintain our existing insurance coverage or obtain    additional coverage on commercially reasonable terms for the use    of our other products in the future. Also, our insurance    coverage and our resources may not be sufficient to satisfy any    liability resulting from product liability claims, and a product    liability claim may have a material adverse effect on our    business, financial condition or results of operations. Because    of the uncertainty of pharmaceutical pricing, reimbursement and    healthcare reform measures, we may be unable to sell our    products profitably in the United States.     The availability of reimbursement by governmental and other    third-party payors affects the market for any pharmaceutical    product. In recent years, there have been numerous proposals to    change the healthcare system in the United States and further    proposals are likely. Some of these proposals have included    measures that would limit or eliminate payments for medical    procedures and treatments or subject the pricing of    pharmaceuticals to government control. In addition, government    and private third-party payors are increasingly attempting to    contain healthcare costs by limiting both the coverage and the    level of reimbursement of drug products. For example, under the    Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization Act of    2003 (the Act), Medicare benefits are provided primarily through    private entities that attempt to negotiate price concessions    from pharmaceutical manufacturers. This may increase pressure to    lower prescription drug prices. The Act also includes other cost    containment measures for Medicare in the event Medicare cost    increases exceed a certain level, which measures may impose    limitations on prescription drug prices. These changes in    Medicare reimbursement could have a negative impact on our    revenues derived from sales of our products. Moreover,    significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of    newly-approved healthcare products.     Our ability to commercialize our products will depend, in part,    on the extent to which reimbursement for the cost of the    products and related treatments will be available from    third-party payors. If we or any of our collaborators succeed in    bringing one or more products to market, we cannot assure you    that third-party payors will establish and maintain price levels    sufficient for realization of an appropriate return on our    investment in product development. In addition, lifetime limits    on benefits included in most private health plans may force    patients to self-pay for treatment. For example, patients who    receive Adagen are expected to require injections for their    entire lives. The cost of this treatment may exceed certain plan    limits and cause patients to self-fund further treatment.    Furthermore, inadequate third-party coverage may lead to reduced    market acceptance of our products. Significant changes in the    healthcare system in the United States or elsewhere could have a    material adverse effect on our business and financial    performance. The    law or FDA policy could change and expose us to competition from    generic or follow-on versions of our    products, which could adversely impact our    business.     Under current U.S. law and FDA policy, generic versions of    conventional chemical drug compounds, sometimes referred to as    small molecule compounds, may be approved through an abbreviated    approval process. There is no abbreviated approval process under    current law for biological products approved under the Public    Health Service Act through a Biologic License Application, such    as monoclonal antibodies, cytokines, growth factors, enzymes,    interferons and certain other proteins. However, various    proposals have been made to establish an abbreviated approval    process to permit approval of generic or follow-on versions of    these types of biological products under U.S. law, and the    FDAs counterpart in the European Union has recently    approved a number of follow-on biologicals. It is not clear    whether the FDA will adopt any proposals on generic or follow-on    biologics. However, if the law is changed or if the FDA somehow    extends its existing authority in new ways, and third parties    are permitted to obtain approvals of versions of our biological    products through an abbreviated approval mechanism, and without    conducting full clinical studies of their own, it could    adversely affect our business.    35Table of Contents Risks    Related to Our Common Stock and our Convertible Notes The    price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be,    volatile, which may significantly affect the trading price of    our notes.     Historically, the market price of our common stock has    fluctuated over a wide range, and it is likely that the price of    our common stock will fluctuate in the future. The market price    of our common stock could be impacted due to a variety of    factors, including, in addition to global and industry-wide    events:           the level of revenues we generate from our sale of products and    royalties we receive;           the losses we incur or the profits we generate;           the results of preclinical testing and clinical trials by us,    our collaborative partners or our competitors;           announcements of technical innovations or new products by us,    our collaborative partners or our competitors;           the status of corporate collaborations and supply arrangements;           regulatory approvals;           developments in patent or other proprietary rights;           public concern as to the safety and efficacy of products    developed by us or others; and           litigation.     In addition, due to one or more of the foregoing factors in one    or more future quarters, our results of operations may fall    below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. In    that event, the market price of our common stock could be    materially and adversely affected. Volatility in the price of    our common stock may significantly affect the trading price of    our convertible notes. Events    with respect to our share capital could cause the shares of our    common stock outstanding to increase.     Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the open    market, or the availability of such shares for sale, could    adversely affect the price of our common stock. We had    approximately 44.0 million shares of common stock    outstanding as of December 31, 2006. As of that date, the    following securities that may be exercised for, or are    convertible into, shares of our common stock were outstanding:       Options.  Stock options to purchase    6.7 million shares of our common stock at a weighted    average exercise price of approximately $12.36 per share;           4.5% convertible subordinated notes due 2008 (the    2008 convertible notes). Our 2008 convertible notes    that may be converted into 1.7 million shares of our common    stock at a conversion price of $70.98 per share.           4% convertible senior notes due 2013 (the 2013    convertible notes). Our 2013 convertible notes that may be    converted into 28.8 million shares of our common stock at a    conversion price of $9.55 per share.       Restricted stock units.  1.5 million    shares of our common stock issuable in respect of outstanding    restricted stock units held by officers, employees and directors.     The shares of our common stock that may be issued under the    options, restricted stock, the 2008 convertible notes and the    2013 convertible notes are currently registered with the    Securities and Exchange Commission, and, therefore, those shares    of common stock that may be issued will be eligible for public    resale.     The conversion of some or all of the notes will dilute the    ownership interests of existing stockholders. Any sales in the    public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion    could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common    stock. In addition, the existence of the notes may encourage    short selling by market participants because the conversion of    the notes could depress the price of our common stock.    36Table of Contents The    issuance of preferred stock may adversely affect rights of    common stockholders or discourage a takeover.     Under our certificate of incorporation, our board of directors    has the authority to issue up to three million shares of    preferred stock and to determine the price, rights, preferences    and privileges of those shares without any further vote or    action by our stockholders. The rights of the holders of common    stock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the    rights of the holders of any shares of preferred stock that may    be issued in the future.     In May 2002, our board of directors authorized shares of    Series B preferred stock in connection with its adoption of    a stockholder rights plan, under which we issued rights to    purchase Series B preferred stock to holders of the common    stock. Upon certain triggering events, such rights become    exercisable to purchase common stock (or, at the discretion of    our board of directors, Series B preferred stock) at a    price substantially discounted from the then current market    price of the common stock. Our stockholder rights plan could    generally discourage a merger or tender offer involving our    securities that is not approved by our board of directors by    increasing the cost of effecting any such transaction and,    accordingly, could have an adverse impact on stockholders who    might want to vote in favor of such merger or participate in    such tender offer.     While we have no present intention to authorize any additional    series of preferred stock, such issuance, while providing    desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions    and other corporate purposes, could also have the effect of    making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority    of our outstanding voting stock. The preferred stock may have    other rights, including economic rights senior to the common    stock, and, as a result, the issuance thereof could have a    material adverse effect on the market value of the common stock. Our    2008 notes are subordinated to all existing and future    indebtedness.     Our 2008 convertible subordinated notes are unsecured and    subordinated in right of payment to all of our existing and    future senior indebtedness, including our 2013 convertible    notes. In the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or    reorganization, or upon acceleration of the notes due to an    event of default under the indenture and in certain other    events, our assets will be available to pay obligations on the    notes only after all senior indebtedness has been paid. As a    result, there may not be sufficient assets remaining to pay    amounts due on any or all of the outstanding notes. We are not    prohibited from incurring debt, including senior indebtedness,    under the indenture. If we were to incur additional debt or    liabilities, our ability to pay our obligations on the notes    could be adversely affected. We may    be unable to redeem our 2013 convertible notes or 2008    convertible notes upon a fundamental change.     We may be unable to redeem the 2013 convertible notes or the    2008 convertible notes in the event of a fundamental change, as    defined in the respective indentures. Upon a fundamental change,    holders of the 2013 convertible notes and 2008 convertible notes    may require us to redeem all or a portion of the 2013    convertible notes and the 2008 convertible notes. If a    fundamental change were to occur, we may not have enough funds    to pay the redemption price for all tendered 2013 convertible    notes and 2008 convertible notes. Any future credit agreements    or other agreements relating to our indebtedness may contain    similar provisions, or expressly prohibit the repurchase of the    2013 convertible notes or 2008 convertible notes upon a    fundamental change or may provide that a fundamental change    constitutes an event of default under that agreement. If a    fundamental change occurs at a time when we are prohibited from    purchasing or redeeming 2013 convertible notes or 2008    convertible notes, we could seek the consent of our lenders to    redeem the 2013 convertible notes or 2008 convertible notes or    could attempt to refinance this debt. If we do not obtain a    consent, we could not purchase or redeem the 2013 convertible    notes or 2008 convertible notes. Our failure to redeem tendered    2013 convertible notes or 2008 convertible notes would    constitute an event of default under the respective indenture.    In such circumstances, or if a fundamental change would    constitute an event of default under our senior indebtedness,    the subordination provision of the indenture governing the 2008    convertible notes would restrict payments to the holders of the    2008 convertible notes.     The term fundamental change is limited to certain specified    transactions as defined in the respective indentures and may not    include other events that might adversely affect our financial    condition or the market value of the 2013 convertible notes or    the 2008 convertible notes or our common stock. Our obligation    to offer to redeem the 2013    37Table of Contents    convertible notes or the 2008 convertible notes upon a    fundamental change would not necessarily afford holders of the    2013 convertible notes or the 2008 convertible notes protection    in the event of a highly leveraged transaction, reorganization,    merger or similar transaction involving us. The    market for unrated debt is subject to disruptions that could    have an adverse effect on the market price of the 2013    convertible notes or the 2008 convertible notes, or a market for    our notes may fail to develop or be sustained.     The 2013 convertible notes and the 2008 convertible notes are    not rated. As a result, holders of the notes have the risks    associated with an investment in unrated debt. Historically, the    market for unrated debt has been subject to disruptions that    have caused substantial volatility in the prices of such    securities and greatly reduced liquidity for the holders of such    securities. If the notes are traded, they may trade at a    discount from their initial offering price, depending on, among    other things, prevailing interest rates, the markets for similar    securities, general economic conditions and our financial    condition, results of operations and prospects. The liquidity    of, and trading markets for, the notes also may be adversely    affected by general declines in the market for unrated debt.    Such declines may adversely affect the liquidity of, and trading    markets for, the notes, independent of our financial performance    or prospects. In addition, certain regulatory restrictions    prohibit certain types of financial institutions from investing    in unrated debt, which may further suppress demand for such    securities. We cannot assure you that the market for the notes    will not be subject to similar disruptions or that any market    for our notes will develop or be sustained. Any such disruptions    may have an adverse effect on the holders of the notes. We may    not have sufficient funds available to pay amounts due under our    2013 convertible notes or 2008 convertible notes.     We may not have sufficient funds available or may be unable to    arrange for additional financing to satisfy our obligations    under the notes. Our ability to pay cash to holders of the notes    or meet our payment and other debt obligations depends on our    ability to generate significant cash flow in the future. This,    to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial,    competitive, legislative and regulatory factors, as well as    other factors that are beyond our control. Also, the indentures    governing our 2013 convertible notes and 2008 convertible notes    do not contain any financial or operating covenants or    restrictions on the payments of dividends, the incurrence of    indebtedness or the issuance or repurchase of securities by us    or any of our subsidiaries. We cannot assure you that our    business will generate cash flow from operations, or that future    borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to    enable us to meet our payment obligations under the notes and    our other obligations and to fund other liquidity needs. "
4,ENZN,ENZON PHARMACEUTICALS INC,2006-03-03,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS         Throughout this Transition Report on Form 10-K, we have madeforward-looking statements in an attempt to better enable the reader tounderstand our future prospects and make informed judgments. By their nature,forward-looking statements are subject to numerous factors that may influenceoutcomes or even prevent their eventual realization. Such factors may beexternal to Enzon and entirely outside our control.         We cannot guarantee that our assumptions and expectations will becorrect. Failure of events to be achieved or of certain underlying assumptionsto prove accurate could cause actual results to vary materially from pastresults and those anticipated or projected. We undertake no obligation orintention to update forward-looking statements.         Certain risks and uncertainties are discussed below. It is not possibleto predict or identify all such factors, however. Accordingly, you should notconsider this recitation to be complete.WE INCURRED A LOSS FOR THE SIX-MONTH PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND THEFISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2005, AND WE EXPECT TO INCUR LOSSES OVER THE NEXTSEVERAL YEARS.         As of December 31, 2005, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately$403.9 million. During the six-month period ended December 31, 2005 and thefiscal year ended June 30, 2005 we incurred net losses of $291.3 million and$89.6 million, respectively. Our net loss in the most recent six-month periodwas primarily attributable to a write-down of goodwill and a write-down ofintangible assets associated with ABELCET. Our net loss in the fiscal year endedJune 30, 2005 was primarily the result of lower sales of ABELCET and a $78.0million charge we incurred to increase our valuation allowance associated withour deferred tax assets based upon our assessment that it was not more likelythan not that we would benefit from these assets. The lower ABELCET sales werecaused by increasingly competitive conditions in the intravenous antifungalmarket. We are currently investing in new programs to better support ABELCET andour other marketed brands; however, we cannot predict the ultimate success ofsuch programs or when our business will return to profitability, if ever.         Our ability to return to profitability will depend primarily onSchering-Plough's effective marketing of PEG-INTRON and our effective marketingof ABELCET, as well as on the rate of growth in our other product sales orroyalty revenues and on the level of our expenses. Our ability to achievelong-term profitability will depend upon our and our licensees' ability todevelop and obtain regulatory approvals for additional product candidates. Evenif our product candidates receive regulatory approval, we cannot assure you thatour products will achieve market acceptance or will be marketed successfully orthat our operations will sustain profitability.OUR BUSINESS IS HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON THE CONTINUED SALES OF PEG-INTRON ANDABELCET. IF REVENUES FROM EITHER OF THESE PRODUCTS FAIL TO INCREASE ORMATERIALLY DECLINE, OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WILL BEMATERIALLY HARMED.         Our results of operations are heavily dependent on the revenues derivedfrom the sale and marketing of PEG-INTRON and ABELCET. Under our agreement withSchering-Plough, pursuant to which Schering-Plough applied our PEG technology todevelop a modified form of Schering-Plough's INTRON A, we are receivingroyalties on worldwide sales of PEG-INTRON. In December 2005, we made thedecision to delay recognition of royalty revenues until actual amounts areknown, resulting in no PEG-INTRON royalties being recorded in the quarter endedDecember 31, 2005. However, during October 2004 through September 2005, the mostrecent twelve-month period for which we have actual royalty revenue information,total royalties comprised approximately 32% of our total revenues. During 2002,Hoffmann-LaRoche received FDA and European Union approval for PEGASYS, acompeting PEGylated interferon-based combination therapy that competes withPEG-INTRON in the United States and all international markets. Hoffman-LaRoche'smarketing and sales efforts in support of PEGASYS have                                       30resulted in significant competitive pressure on PEG-INTRON sales. PEGASYS hascontinued to take market share away from PEG INTRON and the overall market forPEGylated alpha-interferon for the treatment of hepatitis C has beencontracting. As a result, sales of PEG-INTRON in certain markets where itcompetes with PEGASYS and the royalties we receive on those sales have declined.We cannot assure you that PEGASYS will not continue to gain market share at theexpense of PEG-INTRON which could result in lower PEG-INTRON sales and lowerroyalties to us.         In the quarter ended December 2004, Schering-Plough received approvalfor, and launched, PEG-INTRON in combination with REBETOL in Japan. In September2005, Hoffmann-LaRoche reported that PEGASYS combination therapy would receive afast-track review in Japan and approval is expected during the third quarter ofcalendar year 2006. Hoffmann-La Roche's subsidiary (Chugai Pharmaceutical Co.LTD) currently markets other pharmaceutical products in Japan. Even ifSchering-Plough is able to successfully market PEG-INTRON in Japan prior to theapproval and launch of PEGASYS in Japan, it is likely that the launch in Japanof PEGASYS will have a negative impact on PEG-INTRON's Japanese market share andsales.         We cannot assure you that Schering-Plough will be successful inmarketing PEG-INTRON. The amount and timing of resources dedicated bySchering-Plough to the marketing of PEG-INTRON is not within our control. IfSchering-Plough breaches or terminates its agreement with us, the sale ofPEG-INTRON could be slowed or blocked completely. Our revenues will benegatively affected if Schering-Plough cannot meet the manufacturing demands ofthe market.         During the six-month period ended December 31, 2005, ABELCET sales inthe U.S. and Canada accounted for $21.1 million, or approximately 29% of ourtotal revenue. For the year ended June 30, 2005, ABELCET sales were $51.2million, or approximately 31% of our total revenues. ABELCET sales for thefiscal year ended June 30, 2004 were $67.7 million, or 40% of our totalrevenues. We expect that ABELCET will account for a significant portion of ourfuture total revenues. The continued sale of newer products from Merck andPfizer in the antifungal market, as well as the entry of a new product fromAstellas Pharma (formerly Fujisawa Healthcare, Inc.), have negatively impactedABELCET sales, as clinicians utilize these other therapeutic agents. Pfizer andSchering-Plough are each expected to obtain approval for and introduce anadditional new product in the antifungal market within the next year. Inaddition, Astellas Pharma and Gilead Pharmaceuticals are currently marketingAMBISOME, and Three Rivers Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is marketing AMPHOTEC, each ofwhich is a lipid-based version of amphotericin B, for the treatment of fungalinfections. AMBISOME and AMPHOTEC compete with ABELCET which has resulted ingreater competitive pressure on ABELCET sales. During the fiscal year ended June30, 2005 and the six months ended December 31, 2005, we experienced increasingpricing pressure with respect to ABELCET. In particular, Astellas Pharma andGilead Sciences, Inc., have aggressively lowered the price of their product incertain regions and for certain customers in the U.S. This has resulted in theshrinkage or loss of certain of our customer accounts. During the six monthsended December 31, 2005, U.S. and Canadian ABELCET sales decreased to $21.1million or 32% as compared to the same period in 2004. This follows a $16.5million or 24% decrease in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005 compared to thefiscal year ended June 30, 2004. While we are developing and implementingstrategies to address the competitive threats facing ABELCET, we cannot assureyou that we will be able to increase sales of ABELCET or prevent furtherdecreases in ABELCET sales.WE DEPEND ON OUR COLLABORATIVE PARTNERS. IF WE LOSE OUR COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSOR THEY DO NOT APPLY ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO OUR COLLABORATIONS, OUR PRODUCTDEVELOPMENT AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE MAY SUFFER.         We rely heavily and will depend heavily in the future on collaborationswith collaborative partners, primarily pharmaceutical and biotechnologycompanies, for one or more of the research, development, manufacturing,marketing and other commercialization activities relating to many of our productcandidates. If we lose our collaborative partners, or if they do not applyadequate resources to our collaborations, our product development and financialperformance may suffer.                                       31         The amount and timing of resources dedicated by our collaborators totheir collaborations with us is not within our control. If any collaboratorbreaches or terminates its agreements with us, or fails to conduct itscollaborative activities in a timely manner, the commercialization of ourproduct candidates could be slowed or blocked completely. We cannot assure youthat our collaborative partners will not change their strategic focus or pursuealternative technologies or develop alternative products as a means fordeveloping treatments for the diseases targeted by these collaborative programs.Our collaborators could develop competing products.         We cannot assure you that our collaborations will be successful.Disputes may arise between us and our collaborators as to a variety of matters,including financing obligations under our agreements and ownership ofintellectual property rights. These disputes may be both expensive andtime-consuming and may result in delays in the development and commercializationof products.WE WILL NEED TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL FINANCING TO MEET OUR FUTURE CAPITAL NEEDS ANDREPAY OUR OUTSTANDING DEBT, AND THIS FINANCING MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE WHEN WE NEEDIT.         Our current development projects and marketing initiatives requiresubstantial capital. We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents andinvestments and our anticipated cash flow from operations will be adequate tosatisfy our capital needs for the near future, but we will likely need toincrease our cash flow from operations or obtain financing to meet our futurecapital needs, which we expect will be substantial. We will require substantialadditional funds to conduct research activities, preclinical studies, clinicaltrials and other activities relating to the successful commercialization ofpotential products. In addition, we may seek to acquire additional products,technologies and companies, which could require substantial capital. Thecompetitive pressures impacting PEG-INTRON and ABELCET may cause our cash flowfrom operations to decrease rather than increase in the future and we cannot besure that additional funds from other sources will be available on commerciallyreasonable terms, if at all. If adequate funds are unavailable from operationsor additional sources of financing, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of oreliminate one or more of our research or development programs or one or more ofour proposed acquisitions of technologies or companies, which could materiallyand adversely affect our business, financial condition and operations.         As of December 31, 2005, we had $394.0 million of ConvertibleSubordinated Notes outstanding that bear interest at an annual rate of 4.5%. Thenotes will mature on July 1, 2008 unless earlier converted, redeemed at ouroption, or redeemed at the option of the note-holder upon a default by us orfundamental change, each as described in the indenture for the notes. To date wehave been able to pay the interest due on these notes from our cash flow fromoperations or our cash reserves. Our current cash reserves are insufficient torepay the principal amount of this debt in full and we do not anticipate that wewill be able to generate sufficient cash from operations to repay this debt infull by the maturity date. We will be required to repay the notes at maturityunless we can refinance the debt or the noteholders convert their notes intocommon stock before the maturity date. Our notes are convertible into commonstock at a price of $70.98 per share. Noteholders will be unlikely to converttheir notes unless our stock price rises above the conversion price of thenotes. On March 1, 2006 the closing price of our common stock on the NasdaqNational Market was $6.84 per share. We expect that we will need to refinanceor obtain new financing to pay at least a significant portion of this principalamount of these notes. We currently are considering financing alternatives;however, we cannot be certain that any of such financing alternatives will beconsummated on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.         We may seek to raise any necessary additional funds through equity ordebt financings, collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or othersources which may be dilutive to existing stockholders. We cannot assure youthat we will be able to obtain additional funds on commercially reasonableterms, if at all.                                       32WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF INDEBTEDNESS.         At December 31, 2005, our long-term debt was $394.0 million. Thisindebtedness has affected us by:         o   significantly increasing our interest expense and related debt             service costs, and         o   making it more difficult to obtain additional financing.         We may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to satisfy theannual debt service payments that will be required under our 4.5% subordinatedconvertible notes. This may require us to use a portion of the proceeds of thenotes to pay interest or borrow additional funds or sell additional equity tomeet our debt service obligations. If we are unable to satisfy our debt servicerequirements, substantial liquidity problems could result, which wouldnegatively impact our future prospects.WE HAVE LIMITED MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITIES.         We have an approximately 70-person U.S. pharmaceutical sales andmarketing organization to support our products and we generally compete withorganizations that have significantly greater resources devoted to the marketingand sales of their products. Our marketing and sales efforts may be unable tocompete successfully against such other companies. We may be required to seekone or more corporate partners to augment our marketing and sales efforts withrespect to future products. Any delay in developing these resources or obtainingcorporate partners could substantially delay or curtail the marketing of suchproducts. In addition, we have agreements with third-party distributors todistribute our products. If our distributors do not perform their obligations,our ability to distribute our products may be severely restricted.WE PURCHASE SOME OF THE COMPOUNDS UTILIZED IN OUR PRODUCTS FROM A SINGLE SOURCEOR A LIMITED GROUP OF SUPPLIERS, AND THE PARTIAL OR COMPLETE LOSS OF ONE OFTHESE SUPPLIERS COULD CAUSE PRODUCTION DELAYS AND A SUBSTANTIAL LOSS OFREVENUES.         We purchase the unmodified compounds and bulk PEGs utilized in ourapproved products and products under development from outside suppliers. We maybe required to enter into supply contracts with outside suppliers for certainunmodified compounds. For example, we have agreements with OvationPharmaceutical, Inc., by assignment from Merck & Co., Inc., and Kyowa Hakko toproduce the unmodified forms of L-asparaginase used in the manufacture ofONCASPAR. We purchase the unmodified adenosine deaminase enzyme used in themanufacturing of ADAGEN from Roche Diagnostics; however, we no longer have asupply agreement with Roche Diagnostics. We have two suppliers that produce theamphotericin B used in the manufacture of ABELCET, Bristol-Myers Squibb andAlpharma A.p.S. We have a supply agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb, but notwith Alpharma. If we experience a delay in obtaining or are unable to obtain anyunmodified compound on reasonable terms, it could have a material adverse effecton our business, financial condition and results of operations. We purchase thelipids used in the manufacture of ABELCET and the PEGs used in the manufactureof ONCASPAR and ADAGEN from a limited number of suppliers. We do not have formalsupply agreements with any of these suppliers. No assurance can be given thatalternative suppliers with appropriate regulatory authorizations could bereadily identified if necessary. If we experience delays in obtaining or areunable to obtain any such raw materials on reasonable terms, it could have amaterial adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results ofoperations.         If we are required to obtain an alternate source for an unmodifiedcompound utilized in a product, the FDA and relevant foreign regulatory agencieswill likely require that we perform additional testing to demonstrate that thealternate material is biologically and chemically equivalent to the unmodifiedcompound previously used in our clinical trials. This testing could delay orstop development of a product, limit commercial sales of an approved product,and cause us to incur significant additional expenses. If we are unable todemonstrate that the alternate material is chemically and biologicallyequivalent to the previously used unmodified compound, we will likely berequired to repeat some or all of the preclinical and clinical trials conductedfor the compound. The marketing of an FDA approved drug could be disrupted whilesuch tests are conducted. Even if the alternate material is shown to bechemically and biologically equivalent to the previously used compound, the FDAor relevant foreign regulatory agency may require that we conduct additionalclinical trials with the alternate material.                                       33         The period covered by our supply agreement with Ovation Pharmaceuticalsfor L-asparaginase for the manufacture of ONCASPAR for the U.S. and Canadianmarkets will conclude on December 31, 2006. If we are unable to successfullyrenew our supply agreement for L-asparaginase for these markets, it will have apotentially negative impact on our business and results of operations.         Roche Diagnostics, which is based in Germany, is the only FDA-approvedsupplier of the adenosine deaminase enzyme, or ADA, used in ADAGEN. During 2002we obtained FDA approval of the use of the ADA enzyme obtained from bovineintestines from cattle of New Zealand origin. New Zealand currently certifiesthat its cattle are bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE or mad cow disease)free. Beginning in September 2002, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)required all animal-sourced materials shipped to the U.S. from any Europeancountry to contain a veterinary certificate that the product is BSE free,regardless of the country of origin. In September 2003, Roche Diagnosticsnotified us that it has elected to terminate our ADA supply agreement. We arecurrently seeking to develop recombinant ADA as an alternative to the bovinederived product. This is a difficult and expensive undertaking as to whichsuccess cannot be assured. Roche Diagnostics has indicated that it will continueto supply us with our requirements of ADA for a reasonable period of time aftertermination of our supply agreement as we work to develop another source of ADA.If we are unable to secure an alternative source of ADA before Roche Diagnosticsdiscontinues supplying the material to us, we will likely experience inventoryshortages and potentially a period of product unavailability or a long terminability to produce ADAGEN. If this occurs, it will have a measurable (andpotentially material) negative impact on our business and results of operationsand it could potentially result in significant reputational harm and regulatorydifficulties.         We have received a notice from Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (BMS)terminating our amphotericin B supply agreement with BMS effective March 1,2006. We currently have an alternative source of supply of amphotericin B andare seeking to qualify at least one additional source of supply. The terminationby BMS may give rise to future increased costs for the acquisition ofamphotericin B, as well as increased capital expenditures related to readying anew supplier's facilities for cGMP production and regulatory approval of ABELCETincorporating the alternative amphotericin B. Although there can be no assuranceas to the timing of these increased costs and additional capital expenditures,we anticipate that these may be incurred beginning in calendar 2007.         The FDA recently conducted an inspection of the manufacturing facilityof Merck, and that inspection resulted in the issuance, on July 22, 2005, of awarning letter regarding applicable FDA current good manufacturing practice(cGMP) regulations. Despite the assignment of our supply agreement from Merck toOvation Pharmaceuticals, Merck will continue to supply L-asparaginase to OvationPharmaceuticals during a transition period. If Merck is unable to satisfactorilyresolve its current or future manufacturing problems, the FDA could requireMerck to discontinue the manufacture and distribution of the unmodified form ofL-asparaginase used in the manufacture of ONCASPAR, which could require us todiscontinue the manufacture and distribution of ONCASPAR. In addition, if wecannot market and distribute ONCASPAR for an extended period, sales of theproduct and customer relationships will suffer, which would adversely affect ourfinancial results.THERE IS A HIGH RISK THAT EARLY-STAGE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT MIGHT NOTGENERATE SUCCESSFUL PRODUCT CANDIDATES.         In the past year we have terminated our clinical development effortsfor, or relinquished our rights to, four clinical stage compounds, and wecurrently have no products in clinical trials. At the present time the vastmajority of our research and development operations are focused on the earlystages of product research and development. The research and development ofpharmaceutical products is subject to high risk of failure. Most productdevelopment candidates fail to reach the market. Our success depends on theidentification of new drugs or modified forms of existing drugs that we cansuccessfully develop and commercialize. We do not expect any of the drugsresulting from our current research and development efforts to be commerciallyavailable for several years, if at all. In order to fill our pipeline of productcandidates under development, we may attempt to acquire right to products underdevelopment by other companies. The competition for the acquisition of rights toproducts that are viewed as viable candidates for successful development andcommercialization is intense and we will be competing for such opportunitieswith many companies with resources that are substantially greater than ours. Ourpotential products are subject to risks of failure inherent in the developmentof new pharmaceutical products. These risks include, but are not limited to,risks that the drug might prove ineffective or may cause harmful side-effectsduring pre-clinical testing or clinical trials, fails to receive necessaryregulatory approvals, cannot be manufactured on a commercial scale basis andtherefore may not be economical to produce, may fail to achieve marketacceptance, or that we may be precluded from commercialization by proprietaryrights of third parties.                                       34OUR CLINICAL TRIALS COULD TAKE LONGER TO COMPLETE AND COST MORE THAN WE EXPECT.         We will need to conduct significant clinical studies of all of ourproduct candidates that have not yet been approved for sale. These studies arecostly, time consuming and unpredictable. Moreover, statutes and regulationsgoverning the conduct of clinical trials are subject to change in the futurewhich could affect the cost of our clinical trials. Any unanticipated costs ordelays in our clinical studies could harm our business, financial condition andresults of operations, and might even result in discontinuation of clinicaldevelopment of a particular product candidate.         The rate of completion of clinical trials depends upon many factors,including the rate of enrollment of patients. Costly delays in the conduct andcompletion of key clinical studies could result from insufficient timely patientenrollment or from intervention by FDA, drug and safety monitoring boards, orinstitutional review boards.WE DEPEND ON THIRD PARTIES IN THE CONDUCT OF CLINICAL TRIALS AND ANY FAILURE OFTHOSE PARTIES TO FULFILL THEIR OBLIGATIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OURDEVELOPMENT AND COMMERCIALIZATION PLANS.         We depend on independent clinical investigators, corporatecollaborators, academic institutions, contract research organizations, and otherthird party service providers in the conduct of clinical trials. We rely heavilyon these parties for successful execution of our clinical trials, but do notcontrol many aspects of their activities. For example, the clinicalinvestigators are not our employees. However, we are responsible for ensuringthat each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the generalinvestigational plan and protocols for the trial. Third parties may not completeactivities on schedule, or may not conduct our clinical trials in accordancewith regulatory requirements or our stated protocols. The failure of these thirdparties to carry out their obligations could delay or prevent the developmentand commercialization of future product candidates.WE DEPEND ON PATENTS AND PROPRIETARY RIGHTS, WHICH MAY OFFER ONLY LIMITEDPROTECTION AGAINST POTENTIAL INFRINGEMENT AND THE DEVELOPMENT BY OUR COMPETITORSOF COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS. THE U.S. AND FOREIGN PATENTS UPON WHICH OUR ORIGINALPEG TECHNOLOGY WAS BASED HAVE EXPIRED.         The pharmaceutical industry places considerable importance on obtainingpatent and trade secret protection for new technologies, products and processes.Our success depends, in part, on our ability to develop and maintain a strongpatent position for our products and technologies both in the U.S. and in othercountries. We currently hold 129 issued U.S. patents many of which have foreigncounterparts. These patents, if extensions are not granted, are expected toexpire beginning in 2006 through 2022. We have also filed and currently havepending 30 patent applications in the U.S. Under our license agreements, we haveaccess to large portions of Micromet's and Nektar's patent estates as well as asmall number of individually licensed patents. Of the patents owned or licensedby us, seven relate to PEG-INTRON, seventeen relate to ABELCET, and three relateto DEPOCYT. Although we believe that our patents provide certain protection fromcompetition for ABELCET and DEPOCYT, we cannot assure you that such patents willbe of substantial protection or commercial benefit to us, will afford usadequate protection from competing products, or will not be challenged ordeclared invalid. In addition, we cannot assure you that additional U.S. patentsor foreign patent equivalents will be issued to us. The scope of patent claimsfor biotechnological inventions is uncertain, and our patents and patentapplications are subject to this uncertainty.                                       35         We may become aware that certain organizations are engaging inactivities that infringe certain of our PEG and SCA technology patents. Wecannot assure you that we will be able to enforce our patent and other rightsagainst such organizations.         We expect that there will continue to be significant litigation in thebiotechnology and pharmaceutical industries regarding patents and otherproprietary rights. We have in the past been involved in patent litigation, andwe may likely become involved in additional patent litigation in the future. Wemay incur substantial costs in asserting any patent rights and in defendingsuits against us related to intellectual property rights. Such disputes couldsubstantially delay or prevent our product development or commercializationactivities and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financialcondition and results of operations.         Research Corporation Technologies, Inc. held the patent upon which ouroriginal PEG technology was based and had granted us a license under suchpatent. Research Corporation's patent contained broad claims covering theattachment of PEG to polypeptides. However, this U.S. patent and itscorresponding foreign patents expired in December 1996. Based upon theexpiration of the Research Corporation patent, other parties will be permittedto make, use or sell products covered by the claims of the Research Corporationpatent, subject to other patents, including those which we hold. We haveobtained numerous patents with claims covering improved methods of attaching orlinking PEG to therapeutic compounds. We cannot assure you that any of thesepatents will enable us to prevent infringement or that competitors will notdevelop alternative methods of attaching PEG to compounds potentially resultingin competitive products outside the protection that may be afforded by ourpatents. We are aware that others have also filed patent applications and havebeen granted patents in the U.S. and other countries with respect to theapplication of PEG to proteins and other compounds. However, other thanHoffmann-La Roche's PEGASYS, we are unaware of any other PEGylated products thatcompete with our PEGylated products. The expiration of the Research Corporationpatent and the issuance of other patents related to PEG that have been grantedto third parties may have a material adverse effect on our business, financialcondition and results of operations.WE OR OUR SUPPLIERS COULD EXPERIENCE DELAYS OR DIFFICULTIES IN MANUFACTURING,INCLUDING PROBLEMS COMPLYING WITH THE FDA'S REGULATIONS FOR MANUFACTURING OURPRODUCTS. THESE PROBLEMS COULD MATERIALLY HARM OUR BUSINESS.         Manufacturers of drugs must comply with current Good ManufacturingPractices (cGMP) regulations, which include quality control and qualityassurance requirements as well as the corresponding maintenance of records anddocumentation. Manufacturing facilities are subject to ongoing periodicinspection by the FDA and corresponding state agencies, including unannouncedinspections of our commercial manufacturing facilities. We or our present orfuture suppliers may be unable to comply with the applicable cGMP regulationsand other FDA regulatory requirements.         ADAGEN and ONCASPAR, which we manufacture, use our earlier PEGtechnology which tends to be less stable than the PEG technology used inPEG-INTRON and our products under development. Due, in part, to the drawbacks inthe earlier technologies we have had and may continue to have manufacturingproblems with these products.         Manufacturing and stability problems required us to implementvoluntarily recalls for certain batches of ONCASPAR in June 2002, July 2004,September 2004, and March 2005. To date, we have been unable to identify thecause of the manufacturing and stability problems related to these batches. Inaddition to voluntary recalls, mandatory recalls can also take place ifregulators or courts require them, even if we believe our products are safe andeffective. Recalls result in lost sales of the recalled products themselves, andcan result in further lost sales while replacement products are manufactured ordue to customer dissatisfaction. We cannot assure you that future productrecalls will not materially adversely affect our business, our financialconditions, results of operations or our reputation and relationships with ourcustomers.                                       36         During 1998, we began to experience manufacturing problems withONCASPAR. The problems were due to increased levels of white particulates inbatches of ONCASPAR, which resulted in an increased rejection rate for thisproduct. During fiscal 1999, we agreed with the FDA to temporary labeling anddistribution restrictions for ONCASPAR and instituted additional inspection andlabeling procedures prior to distribution. During May 1999, the FDA required usto limit distribution of ONCASPAR only to patients hypersensitive to nativeL-asparaginase. As a result of certain manufacturing changes we made, the FDAwithdrew this distribution restriction in November 1999.         In July 1999, the FDA conducted an inspection of our manufacturingfacility in connection with our product license for ADAGEN. Following thatinspection, the FDA documented several deviations from Current GoodManufacturing Practices, known as cGMP, in a Form 483 report. We provided theFDA with a corrective action plan. In November 1999, the FDA issued a warningletter citing the same cGMP deviations listed in the July 1999 Form 483, but italso stated that the FDA was satisfied with our proposed corrective actions. Asa result of the deviations, the FDA decided not to approve product exportrequests from us for ONCASPAR until it determined that all noted cGMP deviationswere either corrected or in the process of being corrected. This restriction wasremoved in August 2000.         Since November 2002, the FDA and the MHRA, the British equivalent ofthe FDA, have conducted follow-up inspections, as well as routine inspections ofour manufacturing facilities related to ABELCET, ONCASPAR and ADAGEN. Followingcertain of these inspections, the FDA has issued Form 483 reports citingdeviations from cGMP, the most recent of which were issued in January 2006 forour New Jersey facility and August 2005 for our Indianapolis facility. We haveor are in the process of responding to such reports with corrective actionplans.         We are aware that the FDA has conducted inspections of certain of themanufacturing facilities of Schering-Plough, and those inspections have resultedin the issuance of Form 483s citing deviations from cGMP.         If we or our partners, including Schering-Plough, face additionalmanufacturing problems in the future or if we or our licensees are unable tosatisfactorily resolve current or future manufacturing problems, the FDA couldrequire us or our licensees to discontinue the distribution of our products orto delay continuation of clinical trials.WE MAY ACQUIRE OTHER COMPANIES OR PRODUCTS AND MAY BE UNABLE TO SUCCESSFULLYINTEGRATE SUCH COMPANIES WITH OUR OPERATIONS.         We may expand and diversify our operations with acquisitions. If we areunsuccessful in integrating any such company or product with our operations, orif integration is more difficult than anticipated, we may experience disruptionsthat could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditionand results of operations.WE DEPEND ON KEY PERSONNEL AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RETAIN THESE EMPLOYEES ORRECRUIT ADDITIONAL QUALIFIED PERSONNEL, WHICH WOULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.          Because of the specialized scientific nature of our business, we arehighly dependent upon qualified scientific, technical and managerial personnelincluding our Chief Executive Officer. There is intense competition forqualified personnel in the pharmaceutical field; therefore, we may not be ableto attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development ofour business. Although we have employment agreements with our Chief ExecutiveOfficer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Scientific Officer, Senior VicePresident responsible for our sales and marketing operations, and certain otherexecutive officers, our ability to continue to retain such officers, as well asother senior executives or key managers is not assured. The loss of the servicesof one or a combination of our senior executives or key managers, particularlyour Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chief Scientific Officer,and Senior Vice President responsible for our sales and marketing operations, aswell as the failure to recruit additional key scientific, technical andmanagerial personnel in a timely manner, would have an adverse effect on ourbusiness.                                       37RISKS RELATED TO OUR INDUSTRYWE FACE RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE AND INTENSE COMPETITION, WHICH COULD HARM OURBUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.          The biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapid technologicalchange. Our future success will depend on our ability to maintain a competitiveposition with respect to technological advances. Rapid technological developmentby others may result in our products and technologies becoming obsolete.          Many of our competitors have substantially greater research anddevelopment capabilities and experience and greater manufacturing, marketing andfinancial resources than we do. Accordingly, our competitors may developtechnologies and products that are superior to those we or our collaborators aredeveloping and render our technologies and products or those of ourcollaborators obsolete and noncompetitive. In addition, many of our competitorshave much more experience than we do in preclinical testing and human clinicaltrials of new drugs, as well as obtaining FDA and other regulatory approval. Ifwe cannot compete effectively, our business and financial performance wouldsuffer.         We face intense competition from established biotechnology andpharmaceutical companies, as well as academic and research institutions that arepursuing competing technologies and products. We know that competitors aredeveloping or manufacturing various products that are used for the prevention,diagnosis or treatment of diseases that we have targeted for productdevelopment. For example, in addition to increased competition from HoffmanLaRoche's PEGASYS, referred to above, Astellas Pharma and Gilead Pharmaceuticalsare currently marketing AMBISOME, and Three Rivers Pharmaceuticals is marketingAMPHOTEC, each of which is a lipid-based version of amphotericin, for thetreatment of fungal infections. PEGASYS competes with PEG-INTRON and AMBISOMEand AMPHOTEC compete with ABELCET. DEPOCYT, an injectable, sustained releaseformulation of the chemotherapeutic agent cytarabine for the treatment oflymphomatous meningitis, competes with the generic drugs, cytarabine andmethotrexate, and ONCASPAR, a PEG-enhanced version of a naturally occurringenzyme called L-asparaginase, competes with ELSPAR(R) (asparaginase) to treatpatients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.          Existing and future products, therapies and technological approacheswill compete directly with our products. Current and prospective competingproducts may provide greater therapeutic benefits for a specific problem or mayoffer comparable performance at a lower cost. Any product candidate that wedevelop and that obtains regulatory approval must then compete for marketacceptance and market share.WE ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION. COMPLIANCE WITH THESE REGULATIONS CAN BECOSTLY, TIME CONSUMING AND SUBJECT US TO UNANTICIPATED DELAYS IN DEVELOPING OURPRODUCTS. THE REGULATORY APPROVAL PROCESS IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN AND WE MAY NOTSUCCESSFULLY SECURE APPROVAL FOR NEW PRODUCTS.         The marketing of pharmaceutical products in the U.S. and abroad issubject to stringent governmental regulation. The sale of any of our productsfor use in humans in the U.S. will require the prior approval of the FDA.Similar approvals by comparable agencies are required in most foreign countries.The FDA has established mandatory procedures and safety standards that apply tothe clinical testing and marketing of pharmaceutical products. Obtaining FDAapproval for a new therapeutic product may take several years and involvesubstantial expenditures.         We cannot assure you that we or our licensees will be able to obtain ormaintain FDA or other relevant marketing approval for any of our other products.In addition, any approved products are subject to continuing regulation. If weor our licensees fail to comply with applicable requirements it could result inpenalties, fines, recalls or other injunctive or oversight remedies.                                       38         DEPOCYT was approved under the Accelerated Approval regulations ofSubpart H of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. These regulations are intended tomake promising products for life-threatening diseases available to the market onthe basis of preliminary evidence prior to formal demonstration of patientbenefit. Approvals granted under Subpart H are provisional and require a writtencommitment to complete post-approval clinical studies that formally demonstratepatient benefit. Our licensor, SkyePharma, is responsible for conducting therequired study. If the FDA determines that such post-approval clinical studyfails to demonstrate patient benefit, the registration for DEPOCYT may besubject to withdrawal.         If we or our licensees fail to obtain or maintain requisitegovernmental approvals or fail to obtain or maintain approvals of the scoperequested, it will delay or preclude us or our licensees or marketing partnersfrom marketing our products. It could also limit the commercial use of ourproducts. Any such failure or limitation may have a material adverse effect onour business, financial condition and results of operations.EVEN IF WE OBTAIN REGULATORY APPROVAL FOR OUR PRODUCTS, THEY MAY NOT BE ACCEPTEDIN THE MARKETPLACE.         The commercial success of our products will depend upon theiracceptance by the medical community and third-party payors as clinically useful,cost-effective and safe. Even if our products obtain regulatory approval, wecannot assure you that they will achieve market acceptance of any kind. Thedegree of market acceptance will depend on many factors, including:         o   the receipt, timing and scope of regulatory approvals,         o   the timing of market entry in comparison with potentially             competitive products,         o   the availability of third-party reimbursement, and         o   the establishment and demonstration in the medical community of the             clinical safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness of drug             candidates, as well as their advantages over existing technologies             and therapeutics.         If any of our products do not achieve market acceptance, we will likelylose our entire investment in that product, giving rise to a material, adverseeffect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.IF PRECLINICAL AND CLINICAL TRIALS DO NOT YIELD POSITIVE RESULTS, OUR PRODUCTCANDIDATES WILL FAIL.         If preclinical and clinical testing of one or more of our productcandidates does not demonstrate the safety and efficacy of product candidatesfor the desired indications, those potential products will fail. Numerousunforeseen events may arise during, or as a result of, the testing process,including the following:         o   the results of preclinical studies may be inconclusive, or they may             not be indicative of results that will be obtained in human             clinical trials,         o   potential products may not have the desired effect or may have             undesirable side effects or other characteristics that preclude             regulatory approval or limit their commercial use if approved,         o   results attained in early human clinical trials may not be             indicative of results that are obtained in later clinical trials,             and                                       39         o   after reviewing test results, we or our strategic partners may             abandon projects which we might previously have believed to be             promising.         Clinical testing is very costly and can take many years. The failure todemonstrate adequately the safety and efficacy of a therapeutic product underdevelopment would delay or prevent regulatory approval, which could adverselyaffect our business and financial performance.OUR OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS.         Our operations are subject to federal, state and local environmentallaws and regulations concerning, among other things, the generation, handling,storage, transportation, treatment and disposal of hazardous, toxic andradioactive substances and the discharge of pollutants into the air and water.Environmental permits and controls are required for some of our operations andthese permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation by the issuingauthorities. We believe that our facilities are in substantial compliance withour permits and environmental laws and regulations and do not believe thatfuture compliance with current environmental law will have a material adverseeffect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If,however, we were to become liable for an accident, or if we were to suffer anextended facility shutdown as a result of such contamination, we could incursignificant costs, damages and penalties that could harm our business.WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF TYPES OF PRODUCT LIABILITY OR OTHER CLAIMSBASED ON ALLEGATIONS THAT THE USE OF OUR PRODUCTS HAS RESULTED IN ADVERSEEFFECTS, WHETHER BY PARTICIPANTS IN OUR CLINICAL TRIALS OR BY PATIENTS USING OURPRODUCTS.         Although we maintain product liability insurance for claims arisingfrom the use of our products in clinical trials prior to FDA approval and forclaims arising from the use of our products after FDA approval at levels that webelieve are appropriate, we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintainour existing insurance coverage or obtain additional coverage on commerciallyreasonable terms for the use of our other products in the future. Also, ourinsurance coverage and our resources may not be sufficient to satisfy anyliability resulting from product liability claims, and a product liability claimmay have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition orresults of operations.BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTY OF PHARMACEUTICAL PRICING, REIMBURSEMENT ANDHEALTHCARE REFORM MEASURES, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS PROFITABLY INTHE U.S.          The availability of reimbursement by governmental and otherthird-party payors affects the market for any pharmaceutical product. In recentyears, there have been numerous proposals to change the healthcare system in theU.S. and further proposals are likely. Some of these proposals have includedmeasures that would limit or eliminate payments for medical procedures andtreatments or subject the pricing of pharmaceuticals to government control. Inaddition, government and private third-party payors are increasingly attemptingto contain healthcare costs by limiting both the coverage and the level ofreimbursement of drug products. For example, under the Medicare PrescriptionDrug Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act), Medicare benefits areprovided primarily through private entities that attempt to negotiate priceconcessions from pharmaceutical manufacturers. This may increase pressure tolower prescription drug prices. The Act also includes other cost containmentmeasures for Medicare in the event Medicare cost increases exceed a certainlevel, which measures may impose limitations on prescription drug prices. Thesechanges in Medicare reimbursement could have a negative impact on our revenuesderived from sales of our products. Moreover, significant uncertainty exists asto the reimbursement status of newly-approved health care products.         Our ability to commercialize our products will depend, in part, on theextent to which reimbursement for the cost of the products and relatedtreatments will be available from third-party payors. If we or any of ourcollaborators succeeds in bringing one or more products to market, we cannotassure you that third-party payors will establish and maintain price levelssufficient for realization of an appropriate return on our investment in productdevelopment. In addition, lifetime limits on benefits included in most privatehealth plans may force patients to self-pay for treatment. For example, patientswho receive ADAGEN are expected to require injections for their entire lives.The cost of this treatment may exceed certain plan limits and cause patients toself-fund further treatment. Furthermore, inadequate third-party coverage maylead to reduced market acceptance of our products. Significant changes in thehealthcare system in the U.S. or elsewhere could have a material adverse effecton our business and financial performance.                                       40THE LAW OR FDA POLICY COULD CHANGE AND EXPOSE US TO COMPETITION FROM ""GENERIC""OR ""FOLLOW-ON"" VERSIONS OF OUR PRODUCTS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OURBUSINESS.         Under current U.S. law and FDA policy, generic versions of conventionalchemical drug compounds, sometimes referred to as small molecule compounds, maybe approved through an abbreviated approval process.         There is no abbreviated approval process under current law forbiological products approved under the Public Health Service Act through a BLA,such as monoclonal antibodies, cytokines, growth factors, enzymes, interferonsand certain other proteins. However, various proposals have been made toestablish an abbreviated approval process to permit approval of generic orfollow-on versions of these types of biological products under U.S. law, and theFDA's counterpart in the European Union has recently approved the first suchfollow-on biological. For example, some have proposed that the FDA allow ageneric or follow-on copy of certain therapeutic biologics to be approved underan existing mechanism known as a 505(b)(2) application. A 505(b)(2) applicationis a form of an NDA, where the applicant does not have a right to reference someof the data being relied upon for approval. Under current regulations, 505(b)(2)applications can be used where the applicant is relying in part on publishedliterature or on findings of safety or effectiveness in another company's NDA.505(b)(2) applications have not been used to date for therapeutic biologicproducts. In addition, the use of 505(b)(2) applications even for conventionalchemical drug products is the subject of ongoing legal challenge. It is thus notclear what the permitted use of a 505(b)(2) application might be in the futurefor biologics products, or whether any other proposals on generic or follow-onbiologics will be adopted. However, if the law is changed or if the FDA somehowextends its existing authority in new ways, and third parties are permitted toobtain approvals of versions of our products through an abbreviated approvalmechanism, and without conducting full clinical studies of their own, it couldadversely affect our business.RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK, PREFERRED STOCK AND SUBORDINATED NOTESTHE PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK HAS BEEN, AND MAY CONTINUE TO BE, VOLATILE WHICHMAY SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR NOTES.         Historically, the market price of our common stock has fluctuated overa wide range, and it is likely that the price of our common stock will fluctuatein the future. The market price of our common stock could be impacted due to avariety of factors, including, in addition to global and industry-wide events:         o   the level of revenues we generate from our sale of products and             royalties we receive,         o   the losses we incur or the profits we generate,         o   the results of preclinical testing and clinical trials by us, our             corporate partners or our competitors,         o   announcements of technical innovations or new products by us, our             corporate partners or our competitors,         o   the status of corporate collaborations and supply arrangements,         o   regulatory approvals,                                       41         o   developments in patent or other proprietary rights,         o   public concern as to the safety and efficacy of products developed             by us or others, and         o   litigation.         In addition, due to one or more of the foregoing factors in one or morefuture quarters, our results of operations may fall below the expectations ofsecurities analysts and investors. In that event, the market price of our commonstock could be materially and adversely affected.EVENTS WITH RESPECT TO OUR SHARE CAPITAL COULD CAUSE THE PRICE OF OUR COMMONSTOCK TO DECLINE.         Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the open market, orthe availability of such shares for sale, could adversely affect the price ofour common stock. An adverse effect on the price of our common stock mayadversely affect the trading price of the notes. We had 43.8 million shares ofcommon stock outstanding as of December 31, 2005. The following securities thatmay be exercised for, or are convertible into, shares of our common stock wereissued and outstanding as of December 31, 2005:         o   Options. Stock options to purchase 6.1 million shares of our common             stock at a weighted average exercise price of approximately $14.17             per share; and         o   Convertible Subordinated Notes. Notes which will convert to 5.6             million shares of our common stock at a conversion price of $70.98             as of such date.         o   Restricted stock units. 0.8 million shares of our common stock             issuable in respect of outstanding restricted stock units held by             officers, employees and directors.         The shares of our common stock that may be issued under the options arecurrently registered with the SEC. The shares of common stock that may be issuedupon conversion of the Convertible Subordinated Notes are eligible for salewithout any volume limitations pursuant to Rule 144(k) under the Securities Act.THE ISSUANCE OF PREFERRED STOCK MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT RIGHTS OF COMMONSTOCKHOLDERS OR DISCOURAGE A TAKEOVER.         Under our certificate of incorporation, our board of directors has theauthority to issue up to 3.0 million shares of preferred stock and to determinethe price, rights, preferences and privileges of those shares without anyfurther vote or action by our stockholders. The rights of the holders of commonstock will be subject to, and may be adversely affected by, the rights of theholders of any shares of preferred stock that may be issued in the future.         In May 2002, our board of directors authorized shares of Series BPreferred Stock in connection with its adoption of a stockholder rights plan,under which we issued rights to purchase Series B Preferred Stock to holders ofthe common stock. Upon certain triggering events, such rights become exercisableto purchase common stock (or, in the discretion of our board of directors,Series B Preferred Stock) at a price substantially discounted from the thencurrent market price of the Common Stock. Our stockholder rights plan couldgenerally discourage a merger or tender offer involving our securities that isnot approved by our board of directors by increasing the cost of effecting anysuch transaction and, accordingly, could have an adverse impact on stockholderswho might want to vote in favor of such merger or participate in such tenderoffer.         While we have no present intention to authorize any additional seriesof preferred stock, such issuance, while providing desirable flexibility inconnection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, could alsohave the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire amajority of our outstanding voting stock. The preferred stock may have otherrights, including economic rights senior to the Common Stock, and, as a result,the issuance thereof could have a material adverse effect on the market value ofthe common stock.                                       42OUR NOTES ARE SUBORDINATED TO ALL EXISTING AND FUTURE INDEBTEDNESS.         Our 4.5% convertible subordinated notes are unsecured and subordinatedin right of payment to all of our existing and future senior indebtedness. Inthe event of our bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization, or upon accelerationof the notes due to an event of default under the indenture and in certain otherevents, our assets will be available to pay obligations on the notes only afterall senior indebtedness has been paid. As a result, there may not be sufficientassets remaining to pay amounts due on any or all of the outstanding notes. Weare not prohibited from incurring debt, including senior indebtedness, under theindenture. If we were to incur additional debt or liabilities, our ability topay our obligations on the notes could be adversely affected. As of December 31,2005, we had no senior indebtedness outstanding.WE MAY BE UNABLE TO REDEEM OUR NOTES UPON A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE.         We may be unable to redeem our 4.5% subordinated convertible notes inthe event of a fundamental change (defined below). Upon a fundamental change,holders of the notes may require us to redeem all or a portion of the notes. Ifa fundamental change were to occur, we may not have enough funds to pay theredemption price for all tendered notes. Any future credit agreements or otheragreements relating to our indebtedness may contain similar provisions, orexpressly prohibit the repurchase of the notes upon a fundamental change or mayprovide that a fundamental change constitutes an event of default under thatagreement. If a fundamental change occurs at a time when we are prohibited frompurchasing or redeeming notes, we could seek the consent of our lenders toredeem the notes or could attempt to refinance this debt. If we do not obtain aconsent, we could not purchase or redeem the notes. Our failure to redeemtendered notes would constitute an event of default under the indenture. In suchcircumstances, or if a fundamental change would constitute an event of defaultunder our senior indebtedness, the subordination provisions of the indenturewould restrict payments to the holders of notes. A ""fundamental change"" is anytransaction or event (whether by means of an exchange offer, liquidation, tenderoffer, consolidation, merger, combination, reclassification, recapitalization orotherwise) in connection with which all or substantially all of our common stockis exchanged for, converted into, acquired for or constitutes solely the rightto receive, consideration which is not all or substantially all common stockthat:         o   is listed on, or immediately after the transaction or event will be             listed on, a U.S. national securities exchange, or         o   is approved, or immediately after the transaction or event will be             approved, for quotation on The NASDAQ National Market or any             similar U.S. system of automated dissemination of quotations of             securities prices.          The term fundamental change is limited to certain specifiedtransactions and may not include other events that might adversely affect ourfinancial condition or the market value of the notes or our common stock. Ourobligation to offer to redeem the notes upon a fundamental change would notnecessarily afford holders of the notes protection in the event of a highlyleveraged transaction, reorganization, merger or similar transaction involvingus.THE MARKET FOR UNRATED DEBT IS SUBJECT TO DISRUPTIONS THAT COULD HAVE AN ADVERSEEFFECT ON THE MARKET PRICE OF THE NOTES, OR A MARKET FOR OUR NOTES MAY FAIL TODEVELOP OR BE SUSTAINED.         Our 4.5% subordinated convertible notes have not been rated. As aresult, holders of the notes have the risks associated with an investment inunrated debt. Historically, the market for unrated debt has been subject todisruptions that have caused substantial volatility in the prices of suchsecurities and greatly reduced liquidity for the holders of such securities. Ifthe notes are traded, they may trade at a discount from their initial offeringprice, depending on, among other things, prevailing interest rates, the marketsfor similar securities, general economic conditions and our financial condition,results of operations and prospects. The liquidity of, and trading markets for,the notes also may be adversely affected by general declines in the market forunrated debt. Such declines may adversely affect the liquidity of, and tradingmarkets for, the notes, independent of our financial performance or prospects.In addition, certain regulatory restrictions prohibit certain types of financialinstitutions from investing in unrated debt, which may further suppress demandfor such securities. We cannot assure you that the market for the notes will notbe subject to similar disruptions or that any market for our notes will developor be sustained. Any such disruptions may have an adverse effect on the holdersof the notes.                                       43"
