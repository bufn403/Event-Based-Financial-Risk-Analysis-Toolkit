Cautionary Statement About Forward-Looking StatementsWe describe many of the trends and other factors that drive our business and future results in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in other parts of this report (including this Item 1A). Such discussions contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements are those that address activities, events or developments that management intends, expects, projects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future. They are based on management’s assumptions and assessments in light of past experience and trends, current economic and industry conditions, expected future developments and other relevant factors. They are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results, developments and business decisions may differ significantly from those envisaged by our forward-looking statements. We do not undertake to update or revise any of our forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that can affect our performance in both the near- and long-term. These forward-looking statements should be considered in light of the information included in this Form 10-K, including, in particular, the factors discussed below. These factors may be revised or supplemented in subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K.5Risk Factors
Our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition are subject to the principal risks and uncertainties set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results.Macroeconomic and Industry RisksEach of our businesses is subject to unique industry and economic conditions that may adversely affect the markets and operating conditions of our customers, which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations.•Aerospace—Our Aerospace business is impacted by customer buying patterns of aftermarket parts, supplier stability, factory transitions and global supply chain capacity constraints that may lead to shortages of crucial components. Operating results may be adversely affected by downturns in the global demand for air travel which impacts new aircraft production or the delay or cancellation of new aircraft orders, delays in launch schedules for new aircraft, the retirement of aircraft and global flying hours, which impact air transport, regional, business and general aviation aircraft utilization rates. Operating results may be adversely affected by the decrease in air travel demand due to regional restrictions or suspension of service for public health, safety, or environmental events. Operating results could also be impacted by changes in overall trends related to end market demand for the product portfolio, as well as, new entrants and non-traditional players entering the market. Operating results in our Defense and Space business unit may be affected by the mix of U.S. and foreign government appropriations for defense and space programs and by compliance risks. Results may also be impacted by the potential introduction of counterfeit parts into our global supply chain.•Honeywell Building Technologies—Operating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in the level of global commercial construction activity (including retrofits and upgrades), lower capital spending and operating expenditures on building projects, less industrial plant expansion, changes in the competitive landscape including new market entrants and new technologies, and fluctuations in inventory levels in distribution channels.•Performance Materials and Technologies—Operating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in capacity utilization for chemical, industrial, refining, petrochemical and semiconductor plants, our customers’ availability of capital for refinery construction and expansion, raw material demand and supply volatility, product commoditization, continued illegal imports of hydrofluorocarbons into Europe and our ability to maximize our facilities’ production capacity and minimize downtime. In particular, the volatility in oil and natural gas prices have and will continue to impact our customers’ operating levels and capital spending and thus demand for our products and services.•Safety and Productivity Solutions—Operating results may be adversely impacted by reduced investments in process automation, safety monitoring, and plant capacity utilization initiatives, fluctuations in retail markets, lower customer demand due to the failure to anticipate and respond to overall trends related to end market demand, changes in the competitive landscape including new market entrants and technology that may lead to product commoditization, and adverse industry economic conditions, all of which could result in lower market share, reduced selling prices and lower margins.An increasing percentage of our sales and operations is in non-U.S. jurisdictions and is subject to the economic, political, regulatory, foreign exchange and other risks of international operations.Our international operations, including U.S. exports, represent more than half of the Company’s sales. Risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations, wage and price controls, antitrust regulations, employment regulations, foreign investment laws, import, export and other trade restrictions (such as sanctions and embargoes), differing levels of protection of intellectual property, acts of industrial espionage, violations by our employees of anti-corruption laws (despite our efforts to mitigate these risks), changes in regulations regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises, nationalization of private enterprises, acts of terrorism, and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions. Instability and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment, and the evolving international and domestic political, regulatory and economic landscape, the potential for changes in global trade policies including sanctions and trade barriers, trends such as populism, economic nationalism and negative sentiment toward multinational companies, and the cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide can impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins.6While there is uncertainty regarding the final outcome and full terms of the United Kingdom’s future relationship with the European Union, it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the United Kingdom and other countries, including the United States, increased tariffs on U.K. imports and exports, and increased regulatory complexities.  The Company has developed plans to mitigate the potential impact of these possible restrictions, but the implications of these uncertainties could affect the Company's business, financial position and results of operations.Existing free trade laws and regulations provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports. Changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, and in particular increased trade restrictions, tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products or from where we import products or raw materials, either directly or through our suppliers, could have an impact on our competitive position and financial results.The United States has commenced certain trade actions, including imposing tariffs on certain goods imported from China and other countries, which has resulted in retaliatory tariffs by China and other countries. Additional tariffs imposed by the United States on a broader range of imports, or further retaliatory trade measures taken by China or other countries in response, could increase the cost of our products.Operating outside of the United States also exposes us to foreign exchange risk, which we monitor and seek to reduce through hedging activities. However, foreign exchange hedging activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us or be successful in eliminating such volatility. Finally, we generate significant amounts of cash outside of the United States that is invested with financial and non-financial counterparties. While we employ comprehensive controls regarding global cash management to guard against cash or investment loss and to ensure our ability to fund our operations and commitments, a material disruption to the counterparties with whom we transact business could expose Honeywell to financial loss.Operating outside the United States also exposes us to additional intellectual property risk. The laws and enforcement practices of certain jurisdictions in which we operate may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the U.S. and may impose joint venture, technology transfer, local service or other foreign investment requirements and restrictions that potentially compromise control over our technology and proprietary information.  Failure of foreign jurisdictions to protect our intellectual property rights, an inability to effectively enforce such rights in foreign jurisdictions, or the imposition of foreign jurisdiction investment or sourcing restrictions or requirements could result in loss of valuable proprietary information and could impact our competitive position and financial results.Risks related to our defined benefit pension plans may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow.Significant changes in actual investment return on pension assets, discount rates, and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and require cash pension contributions in future periods. Changes in discount rates and actual asset returns different than our anticipated asset returns can result in significant non-cash actuarial gains or losses which we record in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and, if applicable, in any quarter in which an interim re-measurement is triggered. With regard to cash pension contributions, funding requirements for our pension plans are largely dependent upon interest rates, actual investment returns on pension assets and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations.We may be required to transition from the use of the LIBOR interest rate index in the future. We have certain contracts indexed to LIBOR to calculate the interest rate. The continued availability of the LIBOR index is not guaranteed after 2021. We cannot predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the administrator of LIBOR or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted. The language in certain of our LIBOR-based contracts identify various events that trigger when a successor rate to the designated rate would be selected. If a trigger is satisfied, such contracts may give the calculation agent discretion over the substitute index or indices for the calculation of interest rates to be selected. The implementation of a substitute index or indices for the calculation of interest rates under our contracts may result in our incurring significant expenses in effecting the transition and may result in disputes or litigation over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the substitute index or indices, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.7Operational RisksRaw material price fluctuations, the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements, or catastrophic events can increase the cost of our products and services, impact our ability to meet commitments to customers and cause us to incur significant liabilities.The cost of raw materials is a key element in the cost of our products, particularly in Performance Materials and Technologies (copper, fluorspar, tungsten salts, ethylene, aluminum, and molybdenum) and in Aerospace (nickel, steel, titanium and other metals). Our inability to offset material price inflation through increased prices to customers, formula or long-term fixed price contracts with suppliers, productivity actions or through commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations.Many major components, product equipment items and raw materials, particularly in Aerospace, are procured or subcontracted on a single or sole-source basis. Although we maintain a qualification and performance surveillance process and we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate, it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases may have in the future. Our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers’ inability to scale production and adjust delivery of long-lead time products during times of volatile demand. Our inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts, which could, in turn, result in reduced sales and profits, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships.We may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisitions, and divestitures may not occur as planned.We regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest non-core businesses. We may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all. In addition, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by (i) the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns, including risk of impairment; (ii) the failure to integrate multiple acquired businesses into Honeywell simultaneously and on schedule and/or to achieve expected synergies; (iii) the inability to dispose of non-core assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions; and (iv) the discovery of unanticipated liabilities, labor relations difficulties, cybersecurity concerns, compliance issues or other problems in acquired businesses for which we lack contractual protections, insurance or indemnities, or with regard to divested businesses, claims by purchasers to whom we have provided contractual indemnification. Our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance in increasingly competitive markets with acceptable margins.Our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to (i) identify and evolve with emerging technological and broader industry trends in our target end-markets; (ii) develop and maintain competitive products; (iii) defend our market share against an ever-expanding number of competitors including many new and non-traditional competitors; (iv) enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization of our products; (v) develop, manufacture and bring compelling new products to market quickly and cost-effectively; (vi) monitor disruptive technologies and business models; (vii) achieve sufficient return on investment for new products introduced based on capital expenditures and research and development spending; (viii) respond to changes in overall trends related to end-market demand; and (ix) attract, develop and retain individuals with the requisite technical expertise and understanding of customers’ needs to develop new technologies and introduce new products. Competitors may also develop after-market services and parts for our products which attract customers and adversely affect our return on investment for new products. The failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors or the failure to address any of the above factors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects.8Failure to increase productivity through sustainable operational improvements, as well as an inability to successfully execute repositioning projects or to effectively manage our workforce, may reduce our profitability or adversely impact our businesses.Our profitability and margin growth are dependent upon our ability to drive sustainable improvements. In addition, we seek productivity and cost savings benefits through repositioning actions and projects, such as consolidation of manufacturing facilities, transitions to cost-competitive regions and product line rationalizations. Risks associated with these actions include delays in execution, additional unexpected costs, realization of fewer than estimated productivity improvements and adverse effects on employee morale. We may not realize the full operational or financial benefits we expect, the recognition of these benefits may be delayed and these actions may potentially disrupt our operations. In addition, organizational changes, increased attrition, failure to create and implement a succession plan for key Company positions, not retaining key talent, inability to attract new employees with unique skills, labor relations difficulties, or workforce stoppage could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position and results of operations.As a supplier to the U.S. Government, we are subject to unique risks, such as the right of the U.S. Government to terminate contracts for convenience and to conduct audits and investigations of our operations and performance.U.S. Government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform consistent with the terms of the applicable contract. Our contracts with the U.S. Government are also subject to government audits that may recommend downward price adjustments and other changes. When appropriate and prudent, we made adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in the past and may do so in the future.We are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations. If, as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations (including investigation of violations of certain environmental, employment or export laws), Honeywell or one of its businesses were found to have violated applicable law, then it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts, suspended from contract performance pending the completion of legal proceedings and/or have its export privileges suspended.Our operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities.Mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to claims of personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures. We continue to incur remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. Various federal, state, local and foreign governments regulate the discharge of materials into the environment, or the use of or communications respecting certain materials in our products, and can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations, and require injunctive relief measures, including installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases, or limiting access of our products to markets, among others. In addition, changes in laws, regulations and enforcement of policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites, the establishment of stricter toxicity standards with respect to certain contaminants, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur additional costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations.9Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations.Global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology (IT) systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company, its products, its customers and/or its third party service providers, including cloud providers. Our customers, including the U.S. government, are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards in our products, and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats and incidents, none of them to date have been material to the Company. We seek to deploy comprehensive measures to deter, prevent, detect, respond to and mitigate these threats, including identity and access controls, data protection, vulnerability assessments, continuous monitoring of our IT networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems. Despite these efforts, cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include financial loss, reputational damage, litigation with third parties, theft of intellectual property, fines levied by the Federal Trade Commission, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs due to the increasing sophistication and proliferation of threats, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations.The development of technology products and services presents security and safety risks.An increasing number of our products, services and technologies are delivered with Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities and the accompanying interconnected device networks which include sensors, data and advanced computing capabilities. We have developed product software designs which we believe are less susceptible to cyber-attacks, but despite these efforts, if our products and services that include IoT solutions do not work as intended or are compromised, the possible consequences include financial loss, reputational damage, exposure to legal claims or enforcement actions, theft of intellectual property, and diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations.Data privacy, data protection, and information security may require significant resources and presents certain risks.We collect, store, have access to and otherwise process certain confidential or sensitive data, including proprietary business information, personal data or other information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and/or customer-imposed controls. Despite our efforts to protect such data, we may be vulnerable to material security breaches, theft, misplaced or lost data, programming errors, or employee errors that could potentially lead to the compromising of such data, improper use of our systems, software solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions. In addition, we operate in an environment in which there are different and potentially conflicting data privacy laws in effect in the various U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and we must understand and comply with each law and standard in each of these jurisdictions while ensuring the data is secure. For example, the State of California recently passed legislation granting residents certain new data privacy rights and regulating the security of IoT devices, effective in January 2020; European laws require us to have an approved legal mechanism to transfer personal data out of Europe; the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, which became enforceable in May 2018, superseded prior European Union data protection legislation and imposes more stringent requirements in how we collect and process personal data and provides for significantly greater penalties for noncompliance; and several other countries have passed laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions. Government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business, and violations of data privacy laws can result in fines, reputational damage and civil lawsuits, any of which may adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements.10A material disruption of our operations, particularly at our manufacturing facilities or within our information technology infrastructure, could adversely affect our business.Our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to natural disasters, including hurricanes and floods, power outages, fires, explosions, terrorism, equipment failures, sabotage, cyber incidents, adverse weather conditions, labor disputes, critical supply failure, inaccurate downtime forecast, political disruption, and other reasons, which can result in undesirable consequences, including financial losses and damaged relationships with customers. Public health crises, like a regional or global pandemic, could disrupt our supply chain, distribution channels, production facilities, operations and customer demand, which could negatively impact our operations and adversely affect our business. We employ information technology systems and networks to support the business and rely on them to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. Disruptions to our information technology infrastructure from system failures, shutdowns, power outages, telecommunication or utility failures, cybersecurity incidents, and other events, including disruptions at our cloud computing, server, systems and other third party IT service providers, could interfere with our operations, interrupt production and shipments, damage customer and business partner relationships, and negatively impact our reputation.Concentrations of credit and market risk may adversely affect our results of operations.We maintain long-term contract relationships with many of our customers, suppliers, and other counterparties.  While we monitor the financial health of these counterparties, we are exposed to credit and market risks to the extent that customers, suppliers, and other counterparties are concentrated in similar industries and geographic regions.  Changes in economic conditions in these industries or geographic regions could result in the credit deterioration or insolvency of a significant counterparty, which may lead to concerns about the creditworthiness of other counterparties in the same industry or geography, impacting our ability to renew our long-term contract arrangements or collect amounts due under these arrangements. Legal and Regulatory RisksOur U.S. and non-U.S. tax liabilities are dependent, in part, upon the distribution of income among various jurisdictions in which we operate.Our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax laws, regulations and judicial rulings (or changes in the interpretation thereof), potential taxation of digital services, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures and various other governmental enforcement initiatives. Our tax expense includes estimates of tax reserves and reflects other estimates and assumptions, including assessments of future earnings of the Company which could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets. Changes in tax laws or regulations, including further regulatory developments arising from U.S. tax reform legislation as well as multi-jurisdictional changes enacted in response to the action items provided by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), will increase tax uncertainty and impact our provision for income taxes.11Changes in legislation or government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations.The sales and margins of each of our segments are directly impacted by government regulations including safety, performance and product certification regulations. Within Aerospace, the operating results of Commercial Original Equipment and Commercial Aftermarket may be impacted by, among other things, mandates of the Federal Aviation Administration and other similar international regulatory bodies requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft. Our Defense and Space business unit may be affected by changes in government procurement regulations. Within Honeywell Building Technologies and Safety and Productivity Solutions, the demand for and cost of providing products, services and solutions can be impacted by fire, security, safety, health care, environmental and energy efficiency standards and regulations. Performance Materials and Technologies’ results of operations can be impacted by environmental standards, regulations, and judicial determinations. Growth in all our businesses within emerging markets may be adversely impacted by the inability to acquire and retain qualified employees where local employment law mandates may be restrictive. Noncompliance with legislation and regulations can result in fines and penalties.Increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change may result in more international, regional and/or federal or other stakeholder requirements or expectations that could mandate more restrictive or expansive standards, such as stricter limits on greenhouse gas emissions or more prescriptive reporting of environmental, social, and governance metrics, than the voluntary commitments, that the Company has adopted or require such changes on a more accelerated time frame. There continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty. If environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon the Company or its products, they could negatively impact the Company’s business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position.We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters, government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties.We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employment, employee benefits plans, intellectual property, antitrust, accounting, import and export, and environmental, health and safety matters. Our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, and we may become subject to or be required to pay damage awards or settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities. The incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and financial condition.12"

Cautionary Statement About Forward-Looking StatementsWe describe many of the trends and other factors that drive our business and future results in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in other parts of this report (including this Item 1A). Such discussions contain forward-looking statements within  the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.5 Forward-looking statements are those that address activities, events or developments that management intends, expects, projects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future. They are based on managements assumptions and assessments in light of past experience and trends, current economic  and industry conditions, expected future developments and other relevant factors. They are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results, developments and business decisions may differ significantly from those envisaged by our forward-looking statements. We do not undertake to update or revise any  of our forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that can affect our performance in both the near-and long-term. These forward-looking statements should be considered in light of the information included in this Form 10-K, including, in particular, the factors  discussed below. These factors may be revised or supplemented in subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K.Risk Factors
Our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition are subject to the principal risks and uncertainties set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results.Macroeconomic and Industry RisksIndustry and economic conditions may adversely affect the markets and operating conditions of our customers, which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations.              AerospaceOperating results of Aerospace are directly tied to cyclical industry and economic conditions, as well as changes in customer buying patterns of aftermarket parts, supplier stability, factory transitions and global supply chain capacity constraints that may lead to shortages of crucial components.      The operating results of our Commercial Aviation business unit may be adversely affected by downturns in the global demand for air travel which impacts new aircraft production or the delay or cancellation of new aircraft orders, delays in launch schedules for new aircraft, the retirement of aircraft and      global flying hours, which impact air transport, regional, business and general aviation aircraft utilization rates. Operating results could also be impacted by changes in overall trends related to end market demand for the product portfolio, as well as, new entrants and non-traditional players entering the      market. Operating results in our Defense and Space business unit may be affected by the mix of U.S. and foreign government appropriations for defense and space programs and by compliance risks. Results may also be impacted by the potential introduction of counterfeit parts into our global supply      chain.              Honeywell Building TechnologiesOperating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in the level of global commercial construction activity (including retrofits and upgrades), lower capital spending and operating expenditures on building projects, less industrial plant expansion, changes in the      competitive landscape including new market entrants and new technologies, and fluctuations in inventory levels in distribution channels.              Performance Materials and TechnologiesOperating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in capacity utilization for chemical, industrial, refining, petrochemical and semiconductor plants, our customers availability of capital for refinery construction and expansion, raw material demand and      supply volatility, product commoditization, and our ability to maximize our facilities production capacity and minimize downtime. In particular, the volatility in oil and natural gas prices have and will continue to impact our customers operating levels and capital spending and thus demand for our products and      services.              Safety and Productivity SolutionsOperating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in the level of global capital spending and operating expenditures, including in the oil and gas industry, reduced investments in process automation, safety monitoring, and plant capacity utilization initiatives,      fluctuations in retail markets, lower customer demand due to the failure to anticipate and respond to overall trends related to end market demand, changes in the 6          competitive landscape including new market entrants and technology that may lead to product commoditization, and adverse industry economic conditions, all of which could result in lower market share, reduced selling prices and lower margins.An increasing percentage of our sales and operations is in non-U.S. jurisdictions and is subject to the economic, political, regulatory, foreign exchange and other risks of international operations.Our international operations, including U.S. exports, represent more than half of the Companys sales. Risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations, wage and price controls, antitrust regulations, employment regulations, foreign investment laws, import, export and other trade  restrictions (such as sanctions and embargoes), violations by our employees of anti-corruption laws (despite our efforts to mitigate these risks), changes in regulations regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises, nationalization of private enterprises, acts of terrorism, and our ability to hire and maintain  qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions. Instability and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment, and the evolving international and domestic political, regulatory and economic landscape, the potential for changes in global trade policies including sanctions and  trade barriers, trends such as populism, economic nationalism and negative sentiment toward multinational companies, and the cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide can impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing or other strategies for growing  our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins.While it is currently not known what the final outcome and full terms of the United Kingdoms future relationship with the European Union will be, it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the United Kingdom and other countries, including the United States, increased  tariffs on U.K. imports and exports, and increased regulatory complexities.Existing free trade laws and regulations, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, or any successor agreement, provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports. Changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, and in particular increased trade  restrictions, tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products or from where we import products or raw materials, either directly or through our suppliers, could have an impact on our competitive position and financial results.Operating outside of the United States also exposes us to foreign exchange risk, which we monitor and seek to reduce through hedging activities. However, foreign exchange hedging activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us or be successful in eliminating such volatility. Finally, we  generate significant amounts of cash outside of the United States that is invested with financial and non-financial counterparties. While we employ comprehensive controls regarding global cash management to guard against cash or investment loss and to ensure our ability to fund our operations and  commitments, a material disruption to the counterparties with whom we transact business could expose Honeywell to financial loss.Risks related to our defined benefit pension plans may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow.Significant changes in actual investment return on pension assets, discount rates, and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and require cash pension contributions in future periods. Changes in discount rates and actual asset returns different than our anticipated asset returns can  result in significant non-cash actuarial gains or losses which we record in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and, if applicable, in any quarter in which an interim re-measurement is triggered. With regard to cash pension contributions, funding requirements for our pension plans are largely dependent upon  interest rates, actual investment returns on pension assets and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations.7 Operational RisksRaw material price fluctuations, the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements, or catastrophic events can increase the cost of our products and services, impact our ability to meet commitments to customers and cause us to incur significant liabilities.The cost of raw materials is a key element in the cost of our products, particularly in Performance Materials and Technologies (R240, copper, fluorspar, tungsten salts, ethylene, and perchloroethylene) and in Aerospace (nickel, steel, titanium and other metals). Our inability to offset material price inflation  through increased prices to customers, formula or long-term fixed price contracts with suppliers, productivity actions or through commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations.Many major components, product equipment items and raw materials, particularly in Aerospace, are procured or subcontracted on a single or sole-source basis.

We may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all, and during integration we may discover cybersecurity and compliance issues. In  addition, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by (i) the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns, including risk of impairment; (ii) the failure to integrate multiple acquired businesses into Honeywell simultaneously and on schedule and/or to achieve  expected synergies; (iii) the inability to dispose of non-core assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions; (iv) the discovery of unanticipated liabilities, labor relations difficulties or other problems in acquired businesses for which we lack contractual protections, insurance or indemnities, or with regard  to divested businesses, claims by purchasers to whom we have provided contractual indemnification and (v) the inability to collect on the indemnification and reimbursement agreements entered into with our spin-offs, Garrett Motion Inc. and Resideo Technologies, Inc.Our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance in increasingly competitive markets with acceptable margins.Our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to (i) identify and evolve with emerging technological and broader industry trends in our target end-markets, (ii) develop and maintain competitive products, (iii) defend our market share against an ever-expanding number of  competitors including many new and non-traditional competitors, (iv) enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization of our products, (v) develop, manufacture and bring compelling new products to market quickly and  cost-effectively, (vi) monitor disruptive technologies and business models, (vii) achieve sufficient return on investment for new products introduced based on capital expenditures and research and development spending, (viii) respond to changes in overall trends related to end market demand, and (x) attract,  develop and retain individuals with the requisite technical expertise and understanding of customers needs to develop new technologies and introduce new products. Competitors may also develop after-market services and parts for our products which attract customers and adversely affect our return on  investment for new products.8 The failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors or the failure to address any of the above factors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects.Failure to increase productivity through sustainable operational improvements, as well as an inability to successfully execute repositioning projects or to effectively manage our workforce, may reduce our profitability or adversely impact our businesses.Our profitability and margin growth are dependent upon our ability to drive sustainable improvements. In addition, we seek productivity and cost savings benefits through repositioning actions and projects, such as consolidation of manufacturing facilities, transitions to cost-competitive regions and product line  rationalizations. Risks associated with these actions include delays in execution of the planned initiatives, additional unexpected costs, realization of fewer than estimated productivity improvements and adverse effects on employee morale. We may not realize the full operational or financial benefits we expect,  the recognition of these benefits may be delayed and these actions may potentially disrupt our operations. In addition, organizational changes, increased attrition, failure to create and implement a succession plan for key Company positions, not retaining key talent, inability to attract new employees with unique  skills, labor relations difficulties, or workforce stoppage could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position and results of operations.As a supplier to the U.S. Government, we are subject to unique risks, such as the right of the U.S. Government to terminate contracts for convenience and to conduct audits and investigations of our operations and performance.U.S. Government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform consistent with the terms of the applicable contract. Our contracts with the U.S. Government are also subject to government audits that may recommend  downward price adjustments and other changes. When appropriate and prudent, we have made adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in the past and may do so in the future.We are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations. If, as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations (including investigation of violations of certain environmental, employment or export laws), Honeywell  or one of its businesses were found to have violated applicable law, then it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts, suspended from contract performance pending the completion of legal proceedings and/or have its export privileges suspended.Our operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities.Mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to claims of personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures. We  continue to incur remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental  matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. Various federal, state, local and foreign governments regulate the discharge of materials into the environment, or the use of or communications respecting certain materials in our products, and can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations,  and require injunctive relief measures, including installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases, or limiting access of our products to markets, among others. In addition, changes in laws, regulations and  enforcement of policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites, the establishment of stricter toxicity standards with respect to certain contaminants, or the imposition of new clean-up9 requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur additional costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations.Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations.Global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology (IT) systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company, its products, its customers and/or its third  party service providers, including cloud providers. Our customers, including the U.S. government, are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards in our products, and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands. While we have experienced, and expect  to continue to experience, these types of threats and incidents, none of them to date have been material to the Company. We seek to deploy comprehensive measures to deter, prevent, detect, respond to and mitigate these threats, including identity and access controls, data protection, vulnerability  assessments, product software designs which we believe are less susceptible to cyber attacks, continuous monitoring of our IT networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems. Despite these efforts, cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in  the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. Cybersecurity incidents aimed at the software imbedded in our products could lead to third party claims that our product  failures have caused a similar range of damages to our customers, and this risk is enhanced by the increasingly connected nature of our products. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include financial loss, reputational damage, litigation with third parties, theft of intellectual property,  fines levied by the Federal Trade Commission, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs due to the increasing sophistication and proliferation of threats, which in turn could adversely affect our  competitiveness and results of operations.Data privacy, identity protection, and information security may require significant resources and presents certain risks.We collect, store, have access to and otherwise process certain confidential or sensitive data, including proprietary business information, personal data or other information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and/or customer-imposed controls. Despite our efforts to protect such data, we  may be vulnerable to material security breaches, theft, misplaced or lost data, programming errors, or employee errors that could potentially lead to the compromising of such data, improper use of our systems, software solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of  information, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions. In addition, we operate in an environment in which there are different and potentially conflicting data privacy laws in effect in the various U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and we must understand and  comply with each law and standard in each of these jurisdictions while ensuring the data is secure. For example, the State of California recently passed legislation granting residents certain new data privacy rights and regulating the security of Internet of Things devices, which will go into effect in January 2020;  European laws require us to have an approved legal mechanism to transfer personal data out of Europe; the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, which took effect in May 2018, superseded prior European Union data protection legislation and imposes more stringent requirements in how we  collect and process personal data and provides for significantly greater penalties for noncompliance; and several other countries have passed laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions. Government enforcement  actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business, and violations of data privacy laws can result in fines, reputational damage and civil lawsuits, any of which may adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements.10 A material disruption of our operations, particularly at our manufacturing facilities or within our information technology infrastructure, could adversely affect our business.Our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to natural disasters including hurricanes and floods, power outages, fires, explosions, terrorism, equipment failures, sabotage, adverse weather conditions, public health crises, labor  disputes, critical supply failure, inaccurate downtime forecast, political disruption, and other reasons, which can result in undesirable consequences, including financial losses and damaged relationships with customers. We employ information technology systems and networks to support the business and rely on  them to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. Disruptions to our information technology infrastructure from system failures, shutdowns, power outages, telecommunication or utility failures, and other events, including disruptions  at our cloud computing, server, systems and other third party IT service providers, could interfere with our operations, interrupt production and shipments, damage customer and business partner relationships, and negatively impact our reputation.Legal and Regulatory RisksOur U.S. and non-U.S. tax liabilities are dependent, in part, upon the distribution of income among various jurisdictions in which we operate.Our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax laws, regulations and judicial rulings (or changes in the interpretation thereof), potential expansion of  taxation on digital services, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of  our tax exposures and various other governmental enforcement initiatives. Our tax expense includes estimates of tax reserves and reflects other estimates and assumptions, including assessments of future earnings of the Company which could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets. Changes in tax laws  or regulations, including further regulatory developments arising from U.S. tax reform legislation as well as multi-jurisdictional changes enacted in response to the action items provided by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), will increase tax uncertainty and impact our provision  for income taxes.Changes in legislation or government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations.The sales and margins of each of our segments are directly impacted by government regulations including safety, performance and product certification regulations. Within Aerospace, the operating results of Commercial Original Equipment and Commercial Aftermarket may be impacted by, among other  things, mandates of the Federal Aviation Administration and other similar international regulatory bodies requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft. Our Defense and Space business unit may be affected by changes in government procurement regulations. Within Honeywell Building Technologies, the  demand for and cost of providing products, services and solutions can be impacted by fire, security, safety, health care, environmental and energy efficiency standards and regulations. Performance Materials and Technologies results of operations can be impacted by environmental standards, regulations, and  judicial determinations. Growth in all our businesses within emerging markets may be adversely impacted by the inability to acquire and retain qualified employees where local employment law mandates may be restrictive. Noncompliance with legislation and regulations can result in fines and penalties.Increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change may result in more international, regional and/or federal requirements to reduce or mitigate global warming and these regulations could mandate even more restrictive standards, such as stricter limits on greenhouse gas emissions,  than the voluntary commitments that the Company has made or require such changes on a more accelerated time frame. There continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation, which11 creates economic and regulatory uncertainty. If environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon the Company or its products, they could negatively impact the Companys business, capital expenditures, results of  operations, financial condition and competitive position.We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters, government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties.We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and  divestitures, employment, employee benefits plans, intellectual property, antitrust, accounting, import and export, and environmental, health and safety matters. Our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary  requirements, and we may become subject to or be required to pay damage awards or settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate  to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities. The incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and financial condition.12 "

Cautionary Statement About Forward-Looking StatementsWe describe many of the trends and other factors that drive our business and future results in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in other parts of this report (including this Item 1A). Such discussions contain forward-looking statements within  the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.Forward-looking statements are those that address activities, events or developments that management intends, expects, projects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future. They5 are based on managements assumptions and assessments in light of past experience and trends, current economic and industry conditions, expected future developments and other relevant factors. They are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results, developments and business decisions may  differ significantly from those envisaged by our forward-looking statements, including with respect to any changes in or abandonment of the proposed spin-offs. We do not undertake to update or revise any of our forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties  that can affect our performance in both the near-and long-term. These forward-looking statements should be considered in light of the information included in this Form 10-K, including, in particular, the factors discussed below. These factors may be revised or supplemented in subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and  8-K.Risk Factors
Our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition are subject to the principal risks and uncertainties set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results.Macroeconomic and Industry RisksIndustry and economic conditions may adversely affect the markets and operating conditions of our customers, which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations.              AerospaceOperating results of Aerospace are directly tied to cyclical industry and economic conditions, as well as changes in customer buying patterns of aftermarket parts, supplier stability, factory transitions and capacity constraints. The operating results of our Commercial Aviation business unit may be      adversely affected by downturns in the global demand for air travel which impacts new aircraft production or the delay or cancellation of new aircraft orders, delays in launch schedules for new aircraft, the retirement of aircraft and global flying hours, which impact air transport, regional, business and general      aviation aircraft utilization rates. Operating results could also be impacted by changes in overall trends related to end market demand for the product portfolio, as well as, new entrants and non-traditional players entering the market. Operating results in our Defense and Space business unit may be affected      by the mix of U.S. and foreign government appropriations for defense and space programs and by compliance risks. Results may also be impacted by the potential introduction of counterfeit parts into our global supply chain. Operating results in our Transportation Systems business unit may be affected by      the level of production and demand for automobiles and trucks equipped with turbochargers, regulatory changes regarding automobile and truck emissions and fuel economy, growing importance of automotive electrification, consumer demand and spending for automotive aftermarket products and delays      in launch schedules for new automobile and truck platforms.              Home and Building TechnologiesOperating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in the level of global residential and commercial construction activity (including retrofits and upgrades), lower capital spending and operating expenditures on building projects, less industrial plant expansion,      changes in the competitive landscape including new market entrants and new technologies, and fluctuations in inventory levels in distribution channels.              Performance Materials and TechnologiesOperating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in capacity utilization for chemical, industrial, refining, petrochemical and semiconductor plants, our customers availability of capital for refinery construction and expansion, raw material demand and      supply volatility, product commoditization, and our ability to maximize our facilities production capacity and minimize downtime. In particular, the volatility in oil and natural gas prices have and will continue to impact our customers operating levels and capital spending and thus demand for our products and      services.              Safety and Productivity SolutionsOperating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in the level of global capital spending and operating expenditures, including in the 6          oil and gas industry, reduced investments in process automation, safety monitoring, and plant capacity utilization initiatives, fluctuations in retail markets, lower customer demand due to the failure to anticipate and respond to overall trends related to end market demand, changes in the competitive      landscape including new market entrants and technology that may lead to product commoditization, and adverse industry economic conditions, all of which could result in lower market share, reduced selling prices and lower margins.An increasing percentage of our sales and operations is in non-U.S. jurisdictions and is subject to the economic, political, regulatory, foreign exchange and other risks of international operations.Our international operations, including U.S. exports, represent more than half of the Companys sales. Risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations, wage and price controls, antitrust regulations, employment regulations, foreign investment laws, import, export and other trade  restrictions (such as sanctions and embargoes), violations by our employees of anti-corruption laws (despite our efforts to mitigate these risks), changes in regulations regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises, nationalization of private enterprises, acts of terrorism, and our ability to hire and maintain  qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions. Instability and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment, including the United Kingdom referendum in favor of exiting the European Union and the evolving international and domestic political, regulatory and economic  landscape, the potential for changes in global trade policies including sanctions and trade barriers, trends such as populism, economic nationalism and negative sentiment toward multinational companies, and the cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide can impair  our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins.Operating outside of the United States also exposes us to foreign exchange risk, which we monitor and seek to reduce through hedging activities. However, foreign exchange hedging activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us or be successful in eliminating such volatility. Finally, we  generate significant amounts of cash outside of the United States that is invested with financial and non-financial counterparties. While we employ comprehensive controls regarding global cash management to guard against cash or investment loss and to ensure our ability to fund our operations and  commitments, a material disruption to the counterparties with whom we transact business could expose Honeywell to financial loss.Risks related to our defined benefit pension plans may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow.Significant changes in actual investment return on pension assets, discount rates, and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and require cash pension contributions in future periods. Changes in discount rates and actual asset returns different than our anticipated asset returns can  result in significant non-cash actuarial gains or losses which we record in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and, if applicable, in any quarter in which an interim re-measurement is triggered. With regard to cash pension contributions, funding requirements for our pension plans are largely dependent upon  interest rates, actual investment returns on pension assets and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations.Operational RisksRaw material price fluctuations, the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements, or catastrophic events can increase the cost of our products and services, impact our ability to meet commitments to customers and cause us to incur significant liabilities.The cost of raw materials is a key element in the cost of our products, particularly in Performance Materials and Technologies (R240, fluorspar, copper, ethylene and perchloroethylene) and in7 Aerospace (nickel, steel, titanium and other metals). Our inability to offset material price inflation through increased prices to customers, formula or long-term fixed price contracts with suppliers, productivity actions or through commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations.Many major components, product equipment items and raw materials, particularly in Aerospace, are procured or subcontracted on a single or sole-source basis. Although we maintain a qualification and performance surveillance process and we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components  are generally adequate, it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases may have in the future. Our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers inability to scale production and adjust delivery of long-lead time products during times of volatile  demand. Our inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts, which could, in turn, result in reduced sales and profits, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships.We may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisitions, and divestitures may not occur as planned.We regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest non-core businesses. We may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all, and during integration we may discover cybersecurity and compliance issues. In  addition, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by (i) the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns, including risk of impairment; (ii) the failure to integrate multiple acquired businesses into Honeywell simultaneously and on schedule and/or to achieve  expected synergies; (iii) the inability to dispose of non-core assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions; and (iv) the discovery of unanticipated liabilities, labor relations difficulties or other problems in acquired businesses for which we lack contractual protections, insurance or indemnities, or with  regard to divested businesses, claims by purchasers to whom we have provided contractual indemnification.The proposed spin-offs of our Homes and Global Distribution business and of our Transportation Systems business into two stand-alone, publicly-traded companies are each contingent upon the satisfaction of a number of conditions, may not be completed on the currently  contemplated timeline, or at all, and may not achieve the intended benefits.On October 10, 2017, the Company announced its intention to separately spin-off our Homes and Global Distribution business, which is part of our Home and Building Technologies segment, and our Transportation Systems business, which is part of our Aerospace segment, into two stand-alone,  publicly-traded companies. Completion of each proposed spin-off is subject to readiness of each spin-off to operate as an independent public company, finalization of the financial statements of the spun-off business, assurance that the separation will be tax-free to our shareowners for U.S. federal income tax  purposes, finalization of the capital structure of the three corporations, the effectiveness of appropriate filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, final approval of the Board of Directors, and other customary matters. Each proposed spin-off is complex in nature, and may be affected by  unanticipated developments, credit and equity markets, or changes in market conditions. These or other unanticipated developments could delay or prevent the proposed spin-offs or cause the proposed spin-offs to occur on terms or conditions that are less favorable than anticipated, including without limitation, the  failure to qualify as tax-free to our shareowners, and the inability of the two spun-off companies to incur sufficient indebtedness to allow for a distribution to Honeywell of proceeds concurrently with the consummation of the spin-offs or to make ongoing cash contributions towards the satisfaction of certain of our  legacy asbestos and environmental remediation liabilities. Furthermore, if the spin-offs are completed, we cannot assure you that each will be successful in meeting its objectives. There is the potential for business disruption and significant separation costs. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect  on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and/or the price of our common stock.8 Our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance in increasingly competitive markets with acceptable margins.Our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to (i) identify and evolve with emerging technological and broader industry trends in our target end-markets, (ii) develop and maintain competitive products, (iii) defend our market share against an ever-expanding number of  competitors including many new and non-traditional competitors, (iv) enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization of our products, (v) develop, manufacture and bring compelling new products to market quickly and  cost-effectively, (vi) monitor disruptive technologies and business models, (vii) achieve sufficient return on investment for new products introduced based on capital expenditures and research and development spending, (viii) respond to changes in overall trends related to end market demand, and (x) attract,  develop and retain individuals with the requisite technical expertise and understanding of customers needs to develop new technologies and introduce new products.The failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects.Failure to increase productivity through sustainable operational improvements, as well as an inability to successfully execute repositioning projects or to effectively manage our workforce, may reduce our profitability or adversely impact our businesses.Our profitability and margin growth are dependent upon our ability to drive sustainable improvements. In addition, we seek productivity and cost savings benefits through repositioning actions and projects, such as consolidation of manufacturing facilities, transitions to cost-competitive regions and product line  rationalizations. Risks associated with these actions include delays in execution of the planned initiatives, additional unexpected costs, realization of fewer than estimated productivity improvements and adverse effects on employee morale. We may not realize the full operational or financial benefits we expect,  the recognition of these benefits may be delayed and these actions may potentially disrupt our operations. In addition, organizational changes, attrition, labor relations difficulties, or workforce stoppage could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position and results of operations.As a supplier to the U.S. Government, we are subject to unique risks, such as the right of the U.S. Government to terminate contracts for convenience and to conduct audits and investigations of our operations and performance.U.S. Government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform consistent with the terms of the applicable contract. Our contracts with the U.S. Government are also subject to government audits that may recommend  downward price adjustments and other changes. When appropriate and prudent, we have made adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in the past and may do so in the future.We are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations. If, as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations (including investigation of violations of certain environmental, employment or export laws), Honeywell  or one of its businesses were found to have violated applicable law, then it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts, suspended from contract performance pending the completion of legal proceedings and/or have its export privileges suspended.Our operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities.Mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to claims of9 personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures. We continue to incur remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past  production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. Various federal, state, local and foreign governments regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and can impose substantial  fines and criminal sanctions for violations, and require installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. In addition, changes in laws, regulations and enforcement of policies, the discovery of previously unknown  contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites, the establishment of stricter state or federal toxicity standards with respect to certain contaminants, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur additional costs in the future that would  have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations.Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations.Global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology (IT) systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company, its products, its customers and/or its third  party service providers, including cloud providers. Our customers, including the U.S. government, are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards in our products, and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands. While we have experienced, and expect  to continue to experience, these types of threats and incidents, none of them to date have been material to the Company. We seek to deploy comprehensive measures to deter, prevent, detect, respond to and mitigate these threats, including identity and access controls, data protection, vulnerability  assessments, product software designs which we believe are less susceptible to cyber attacks, continuous monitoring of our IT networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems. Despite these efforts, cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in  the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. Cybersecurity incidents aimed at the software imbedded in our products could lead to third party claims that our product  failures have caused a similar range of damages to our customers, and this risk is enhanced by the increasingly connected nature of our products. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include financial loss, reputational damage, litigation with third parties, theft of intellectual property,  fines levied by the Federal Trade Commission, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs due to the increasing sophistication and proliferation of threats, which in turn could adversely affect our  competitiveness and results of operations.Data privacy, identity protection, and information security may require significant resources and presents certain risks.We collect, store, have access to and otherwise process certain confidential or sensitive data, including proprietary business information, personal data and other information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and/or customer-imposed controls. Despite our efforts to protect such data, we  may be vulnerable to material security breaches, theft, misplaced or lost data, programming errors, or employee errors that could potentially lead to the compromising of such data, improper use of our systems, software solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of  information, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions. In addition, we operate in an environment in which there are different and potentially conflicting data privacy laws in effect in the various U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and we must understand and  comply with each law and standard in each of these jurisdictions while ensuring the data is secure. Government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the10 regular operation of our business, and violations of data privacy laws can result in fines, reputational damage and civil lawsuits, any of which may adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements.A material disruption of our operations, particularly at our manufacturing facilities or within our information technology infrastructure, could adversely affect our business.Our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to natural disasters including hurricanes and floods, power outages, fires, explosions, terrorism, equipment failures, sabotage, adverse weather conditions, public health crises, labor  disputes, critical supply failure, inaccurate downtime forecast, political disruption, and other reasons, which can result in undesirable consequences, including financial losses and damaged relationships with customers. We employ information technology systems and networks to support the business and rely on  them to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. Disruptions to our information technology infrastructure from system failures, shutdowns, power outages, telecommunication or utility failures, and other events, including disruptions  at our cloud computing, server, systems and other third party IT service providers, could interfere with our operations, interrupt production and shipments, damage customer and business partner relationships, and negatively impact our reputation.Legal and Regulatory RisksOur U.S. and non-U.S. tax liabilities are dependent, in part, upon the distribution of income among various jurisdictions in which we operate.Our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax laws, regulations and judicial rulings (or changes in the interpretation thereof), changes in generally  accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures and various other  governmental enforcement initiatives. Our tax expense includes estimates of tax reserves and reflects other estimates and assumptions, including assessments of future earnings of the Company which could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets. Changes in tax laws or regulations, including further  regulatory developments arising from U.S. tax reform legislation as well as multi-jurisdictional changes enacted in response to the action items provided by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), will increase tax uncertainty and impact our provision for income taxes.Changes in legislation or government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations.The sales and margins of each of our segments are directly impacted by government regulations including safety, performance and product certification regulations. Within Aerospace, the operating results of Commercial Original Equipment and Commercial Aftermarket may be impacted by, among other  things, mandates of the Federal Aviation Administration and other similar international regulatory bodies requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft. Our Defense and Space business unit may be affected by changes in government procurement regulations, while emissions, fuel economy and energy  efficiency standards for motor vehicles can impact Transportation Systems. Within Home and Building Technologies, the demand for and cost of providing products, services and solutions can be impacted by fire, security, safety, health care, environmental and energy efficiency standards and regulations.

Operating results in our Transportation Systems business unit may be affected                                                                          by the level of production and demand for automobiles and trucks equipped with turbochargers, regulatory changes regarding                                                                          automobile and truck emissions and fuel economy, consumer demand and spending for automotive aftermarket products and delays                                                                          in launch schedules for new automobile and truck platforms.  ·Home and Building Technologies—Operatingresults may be adversely impacted by downturns in the level of global residential and commercial construction activity (includingretrofits and upgrades), lower capital spending and operating expenditures on building projects, less industrial plant expansion,changes in the competitive landscape including new market entrants and new technologies, and fluctuations in inventory levels indistribution channels.  ·Performance Materials and Technologies—Operatingresults may be adversely impacted by downturns in capacity utilization for chemical, industrial, refining, petrochemical and semiconductorplants, our customers’ availability of capital for refinery construction and expansion, raw material demand and supply volatility,product commoditization, and our ability to maximize our facilities’ production capacity and minimize downtime. In particular,the volatility in oil and natural gas prices have and will continue to impact our customers’ operating levels and capitalspending and thus demand for our products and services.8·Safety and Productivity Solutions—Operatingresults may be adversely impacted by downturns in the level of global capital spending and operating expenditures, includingin the oil and gas industry, reduced investments in process automation, safety monitoring, and plant capacity utilization initiatives,fluctuations in retail markets, lower customer demand due to the failure to anticipate and respond to overall trends related toend market demand, changes in the competitive landscape including new market entrants and technology that may lead to product commoditization,and adverse industry economic conditions, all of which could result in lower market share, reduced selling prices and lower margins. An increasing percentage of our sales and operations isin non-U.S. jurisdictions and is subject to the economic, political, regulatory, foreign exchange and other risks of internationaloperations. Our international operations,including U.S. exports, represent more than half of the Company’s sales. Risks related to international operations includeexchange control regulations, wage and price controls, antitrust regulations, employment regulations, foreign investment laws,import, export and other trade restrictions (such as embargoes), violations by our employees of anti-corruption laws (despite ourefforts to mitigate these risks), changes in regulations regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises, nationalization ofprivate enterprises, acts of terrorism, and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employeesin these regions. Instability and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment, including the United Kingdomreferendum in favor of exiting the European Union and the evolving U.S. political, regulatory and economic landscape followingthe 2016 elections, and the cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide can impairour flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our abilityto improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins. Operating outside ofthe United States also exposes us to foreign exchange risk, which we monitor and seek to reduce through hedging activities. However,foreign exchange hedging activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us or be successful in eliminatingsuch volatility. Finally, we generate significant amounts of cash outside of the United States that is invested with financialand non-financial counterparties. While we employ comprehensive controls regarding global cash management to guard against cashor investment loss and to ensure our ability to fund our operations and commitments, a material disruption to the counterpartieswith whom we transact business could expose Honeywell to financial loss. Risks related to our defined benefit pension plans mayadversely impact our results of operations and cash flow. Significant changes inactual investment return on pension assets, discount rates, and other factors could adversely affect our results of operationsand require cash pension contributions in future periods. Changes in discount rates and actual asset returns different than ouranticipated asset returns can result in significant non-cash actuarial gains or losses which we record in the fourth quarter ofeach fiscal year, and, if applicable, in any quarter in which an interim re-measurement is triggered. With regard to cash pensioncontributions, funding requirements for our pension plans are largely dependent upon interest rates, actual investment returnson pension assets and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations. Operational Risks Raw material price fluctuations, the ability of key suppliersto meet quality and delivery requirements, or catastrophic events can increase the cost of our products and services, impact ourability to meet commitments to customers and cause us to incur significant liabilities. The cost of raw materialsis a key element in the cost of our products, particularly in Performance Materials and Technologies (R240, fluorspar, copper,ethylene and perchloroethylene) and in Aerospace (nickel, steel, titanium and other metals). Our inability to offset material priceinflation through increased prices to customers, formula or long-term fixed price contracts with suppliers, productivity actionsor through commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations. Many major components,product equipment items and raw materials, particularly in Aerospace, are procured or subcontracted on a single or sole-sourcebasis. Although we maintain a qualification and performance surveillance process and we believe that sources of supply forraw materials and components are generally adequate, it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases may havein the future. Our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers’ inabilityto scale9 production and adjust delivery of long-lead time products during times of volatile demand. Our inability to fill our supplyneeds would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts, which could, in turn, resultin reduced sales and profits, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships. We may be unable to successfully execute or effectivelyintegrate acquisitions, and divestitures may not occur as planned. We regularly review ourportfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest non-core businesses. We may not be able to completetransactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all, and during integration we may discover cybersecurity and complianceissues. In addition, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by (i) the failure of acquired businessesto meet or exceed expected returns including risk of impairment; (ii) the failure to integrate multiple acquired businesses intoHoneywell simultaneously and on schedule and/or to achieve expected synergies; (iii) the inability to dispose of non-core assetsand businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions; and (iv) the discovery of unanticipated liabilities, labor relations difficultiesor other problems in acquired businesses for which we lack contractual protections, insurance or indemnities, or with regard todivested businesses, claims by purchasers to whom we have provided contractual indemnification. Our future growth is largely dependent upon our abilityto develop new technologies and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance in increasingly competitive markets withacceptable margins. Our future growth ratedepends upon a number of factors, including our ability to (i) identify emerging technological trends in our target end-markets,(ii) develop and maintain competitive products, (iii) defend our market share against an ever-expanding number of competitors includingmany new and non-traditional competitors, (iv) enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our productsfrom those of our competitors and prevent commoditization of our products, (v) develop, manufacture and bring compelling new productsto market quickly and cost-effectively, and (vi) attract, develop and retain individuals with the requisite technical expertiseand understanding of customers’ needs to develop new technologies and introduce new products. The failure of our technologiesor products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors could significantly reduce our revenuesand adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects. Failure to increase productivity through sustainable operationalimprovements, as well as an inability to successfully execute repositioning projects or to effectively manage our workforce, mayreduce our profitability or adversely impact our businesses. Our profitability andmargin growth are dependent upon our ability to drive sustainable improvements. In addition, we seek productivity and cost savingsbenefits through repositioning actions and projects, such as consolidation of manufacturing facilities, transitions to cost-competitiveregions and product line rationalizations. Risks associated with these actions include delays in execution of the planned initiatives,additional unexpected costs, realization of fewer than estimated productivity improvements and adverse effects on employee morale.We may not realize the full operational or financial benefits we expect, the recognition of these benefits may be delayed and theseactions may potentially disrupt our operations. In addition, organizational changes, attrition, labor relations difficulties, orworkforce stoppage could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position and results of operations. As a supplier to the U.S. Government, we are subject tounique risks, such as the right of the U.S. Government to terminate contracts for convenience and to conduct audits and investigationsof our operations and performance. U.S. Government contractsare subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform consistentwith the terms of the applicable contract. Our contracts with the U.S. Government are also subjectto government audits that may recommend downward price adjustments and other changes. When appropriate and prudent, we have madeadjustments and paid voluntary refunds in the past and may do so in the future. We are also subject togovernment investigations of business practices and compliance with government10 procurement regulations. If, as a result of anysuch investigation or other government investigations (including investigation of violations of certain environmental, employmentor export laws), Honeywell or one of its businesses were found to have violated applicable law, then it could be suspended frombidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts, suspended from contract performance pending the completion of legalproceedings and/or have its export privileges suspended. Our operations and the prior operations of predecessorcompanies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities. Mainly because of pastoperations and operations of predecessor companies, we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediationof environmental hazards and to claims of personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releasesand exposures. We continue to incur remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuitsand claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances.Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. Various federal,state, local and foreign governments regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and can impose substantial finesand criminal sanctions for violations, and require installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit emissions and/ordecrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. In addition, changes in laws, regulations and enforcement ofpolicies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites, the establishmentof stricter state or federal toxicity standards with respect to certain contaminants, or the imposition of new clean-up requirementsor remedial techniques could require us to incur additional costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financialcondition or results of operations. Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations,result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations. Global cybersecuritythreats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology (IT)systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company, its products, itscustomers and/or its third party service providers including cloud providers. Our customers, including the U.S. government, areincreasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards in our products, and we may incur additionalcosts to comply with such demands. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats andincidents, none of them to date have been material to the Company. We seek to deploy comprehensive measures to deter, prevent,detect, respond to and mitigate these threats, including identity and access controls, data protection, vulnerability assessments,product software designs which we believe are less susceptible to cyber attacks, continuous monitoring of our IT networks and systemsand maintenance of backup and protective systems. Despite these efforts, cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature andscope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidentialor proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. Cybersecurity incidentsaimed at the software imbedded in our products could lead to third party claims that our product failures have caused a similarrange of damages to our customers, and this risk is enhanced by the increasingly connected nature of our products. The potentialconsequences of a material cybersecurity incident include financial loss, reputational damage, litigation with third parties, theftof intellectual property, fines levied by the Federal Trade Commission, diminution in the value of our investment in research,development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs due to the increasing sophisticationand proliferation of threats, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations. Legal and Regulatory Risks Our U.S. and non-U.S. tax liabilities are dependent, inpart, upon the distribution of income among various jurisdictions in which we operate. Our future results ofoperations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countrieswith differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax laws, regulations and judicial rulings (or changes in the interpretation thereof),changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes inthe amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returnsand continuing assessments of our tax exposures and various other governmental enforcement initiatives. Our tax expense includesestimates of tax reserves and reflects other estimates and assumptions, including assessments11 of future earnings of the Companywhich could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets. Changes in tax laws or regulations, including multi-jurisdictionalchanges enacted in response to the guidelines provided by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) toaddress base erosion and profit shifting, and potential comprehensive U.S. tax reform which, among other things, might change certainU.S. tax rules impacting the way U.S based multinationals are taxed, will increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact ourprovision for income taxes. Changes in legislation or government regulations or policiescan have a significant impact on our results of operations. The sales and marginsof each of our segments are directly impacted by government regulations including safety, performance and product certificationregulations. Within Aerospace, the operating results of Commercial Original Equipment and Commercial Aftermarket may be impactedby, among other things, mandates of the Federal Aviation Administration and other similar international regulatory bodies requiringthe installation of equipment on aircraft. Our Defense and Space business unit may be affected by changes in government procurementregulations, while emissions, fuel economy and energy efficiency standards for motor vehicles can impact Transportation Systems.Within Home and Building Technologies, the demand for and cost of providing products, services and solutions can be impacted byfire, security, safety, health care, environmental and energy efficiency standards and regulations. Performance Materials and Technologies’results of operations can be affected by environmental, safety and energy efficiency standards and regulations. Growth in all ourbusinesses within emerging markets may be adversely impacted by the inability to acquire and retain qualified employees where localemployment law mandates may be restrictive. We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigationmatters, government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties. We are subject to anumber of lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of theconduct of our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability(including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employment, employee benefits plans, intellectual property,antitrust, import and export, and environmental, health and safety matters. Our potential liabilities are subject to changeover time due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, and we maybecome subject to or be required to pay damage awards or settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our resultsof operations, cash flows and financial condition. While we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurancecoverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities. The incurrence of significantliabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations, cashflows, liquidity and financial condition. "

Our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition are subject to the principal risks and uncertainties set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results.Macroeconomic and Industry RisksIndustry and economic conditions may adversely affect the markets and operating conditions of our customers, which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations.              AerospaceOperating results of Aerospace are directly tied to cyclical industry and economic conditions, as well as changes in customer buying patterns of aftermarket parts, supplier stability, factory transitions and capacity constraints. The operating results of our Commercial Original Equipment and      Commercial Aftermarket business units may be adversely affected by downturns in the global demand for air travel which impacts new aircraft production or the delay or cancellation of new aircraft orders, delays in launch schedules for new aircraft, the retirement of aircraft and global flying hours, which      impact business and general aviation aircraft utilization rates. Operating results in our Defense and Space Systems business unit may be affected by the mix of U.S. and foreign government appropriations for defense and space programs. Operating results in our Transportation Systems business unit may      be affected by the level of production and demand for automobiles and trucks equipped with turbochargers, regulatory changes regarding automobile and truck emissions and fuel economy, consumer demand and spending for automotive aftermarket products and delays in launch schedules for new      automobile and truck platforms.              ACSOperating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in the level of global residential and commercial construction (including retrofits and upgrades), capital spending and operating expenditures on building and process automation, industrial plant capacity utilization and expansion, and inventory      levels in distribution channels.              PMTOperating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in the capacity utilization for chemical, industrial, refining, petrochemical and semiconductor plants, our customers availability of capital for refinery construction and expansion, raw material demand and supply volatility, and our ability to      maximize our facilities production capacity and minimize downtime. In particular, the volatility in oil and natural gas prices have and will continue to impact our customers operating levels and capital spending and thus demand for our products and 6          services. Pricing of certain chemical products are driven by raw materials that are correlated to the price of oil, hence revenue could be significantly impacted by volatility in the price of oil.An increasing percentage of our sales and operations is in non-U.S. jurisdictions and is subject to the economic, political, regulatory, foreign exchange and other risks of international operations.Our international operations, including U.S. exports, represent more than half of the Companys sales.

In addition, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by (i)  the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns, (ii) the failure to integrate multiple acquired businesses into Honeywell simultaneously and on schedule and/or to achieve expected synergies, (iii) the inability to dispose of non-core assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions,  and (iv) the discovery of unanticipated liabilities or other problems in acquired businesses for which we lack contractual protections, insurance or indemnities or, with regard to divested businesses, claims by purchasers to whom we have provided contractual indemnification.Our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance in increasingly competitive markets with acceptable margins.Our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to (i) identify emerging technological trends in our target end-markets, (ii) develop and maintain competitive products and defend our market share against an ever-expanding number of competitors including many new and non-  traditional competitors, (iii) enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization of our products, (iv) develop, manufacture and bring compelling new products to market quickly and cost-effectively, and (v) attract, develop  and retain individuals with the requisite technical expertise and understanding of customers needs to develop new technologies and introduce new products.The failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects.Failure to increase productivity through sustainable operational improvements, as well as an inability to successfully execute repositioning projects, may reduce our profitability or adversely impact our businesses.Our profitability and margin growth are dependent upon our ability to drive sustainable improvements. In addition, we seek productivity and cost savings benefits through repositioning actions and projects, such as consolidation of manufacturing facilities, transitions to cost-competitive regions and product line  rationalizations. Risks associated with these actions include delays in execution of the planned initiatives, additional unexpected costs and adverse effects on employee morale. We may not realize the full operational or financial benefits we expect, the recognition of these benefits may be delayed and these  actions may potentially disrupt our operations.As a supplier of military and other equipment to the U.S. Government, we are subject to unusual risks, such as the right of the U.S. Government to terminate contracts for convenience and to conduct audits and investigations of our operations and performance.U.S. Government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform consistent with the terms of the applicable contract. Our contracts with the U.S. Government are also subject to government audits that may recommend  downward price adjustments and other changes. When appropriate and prudent, we have made adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in the past and may do so in the future.8 We are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations. If, as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations (including violations of certain environmental, employment or export laws), Honeywell or one of its  businesses were found to have violated applicable law, it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts, suspended from contract performance pending the completion of legal proceedings and/or have its export privileges suspended.Our operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities.Mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to claims of personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures. We  continue to incur remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental  matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. Various federal, state, local and foreign governments regulate the discharge of materials into the environment and can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations, and require installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit  emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. In addition, changes in laws, regulations and enforcement of policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites, the establishment of stricter state or federal  toxicity standards with respect to certain contaminants, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur additional costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations.Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations.Global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology (IT) systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company, its products, its customers and/or its third  party service providers including cloud providers. Our customers, including the U.S. government, are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards in our products and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands. While we have experienced, and expect to  continue to experience, these types of threats and incidents, none of them to date have been material to the Company. We seek to deploy comprehensive measures to deter, prevent, detect, respond and mitigate these threats (including access controls, data encryption, vulnerability assessments, product  software designs which we believe are less susceptible to cyber attacks, continuous monitoring of our IT networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems. Despite these efforts, cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation,  destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. Cybersecurity incidents aimed at the software imbedded in our products could lead to third party claims that our product failures have caused  a similar range of damages to our customers, and this risk is enhanced by the increasingly connected nature of our products. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include reputational damage, litigation with third parties, fines levied by the Federal Trade Commission, diminution in the  value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations.9 Legal and Regulatory RisksOur U.S. and non-U.S. tax liabilities are dependent, in part, upon the distribution of income among various jurisdictions in which we operate.Our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax laws, regulations and judicial rulings (or changes in the interpretation thereof), changes in generally  accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures and various other  governmental enforcement initiatives. Our tax expense includes estimates of tax reserves and reflects other estimates and assumptions, including assessments of future earnings of the Company which could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets. Changes in tax laws or regulations, including multi-  jurisdictional changes enacted in response to the guidelines provided by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) to address base erosion and profit shifting, will increase tax uncertainty and may adversely impact our provision for income taxes.Changes in legislation or government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations.The sales and margins of each of our segments are directly impacted by government regulations including safety, performance and product certification regulations. Within Aerospace, the operating results of Commercial Original Equipment and Commercial Aftermarket may be impacted by, among other  things, mandates of the Federal Aviation Administration and other similar international regulatory bodies requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft. Our Defense and Space business unit may be affected by changes in government procurement regulations, while emissions, fuel economy and energy  efficiency standards for motor vehicles can impact Transportation Systems. Within ACS, the demand for and cost of providing products, services and solutions can be impacted by fire, security, safety, health care, environmental and energy efficiency standards and regulations. PMTs results of operations can be  affected by environmental, safety and energy efficiency standards and regulations. Growth in all our businesses within emerging markets may be adversely impacted by the inability to acquire and retain qualified employees where local employment law mandates may be restrictive.We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters, government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties.We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and  divestitures, employment, employee benefits plans, intellectual property, antitrust, import and export matters and environmental, health and safety matters. Our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements,  and we may become subject to or be required to pay damage awards or settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the  total amount of all insured claims and liabilities. The incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and financial condition.10 "

Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking StatementsWe describe many of the trends and other factors that drive our business and future results in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition, Results of Operations and in other parts of this report (including this Item 1A). Such discussions contain forward-looking statements within the  meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.Forward-looking statements are those that address activities, events or developments that management intends, expects, projects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future. They are based on managements assumptions and assessments in light of past experience and trends, current economic  and industry conditions, expected future developments and other relevant factors. They are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results, developments and business decisions may differ significantly from those envisaged by our forward-looking statements. We do not undertake to update or revise  any of our forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that can affect our performance in both the near-and long-term. These forward-looking statements should be considered in light of the information included in this Form 10-K, including, in particular,  the factors discussed below. These factors may be revised or supplemented in subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K.Risk Factors
Our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition are subject to the risks and uncertainties set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results.Macroeconomic and Industry RisksIndustry and economic conditions may adversely affect the markets and operating conditions of our customers, which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations.              AerospaceOperating results of our business units within Aerospace are directly tied to cyclical industry and economic conditions, as well as changes in customer buying patterns with respect to aftermarket parts, supplier stability, factory transitions and capacity constraints. The operating results of our      Commercial Original Equipment and Commercial aftermarket business units may be adversely affected by downturns in the global demand for air travel which impacts new aircraft production or the delay or cancellation of new aircraft orders, delays in launch schedules for new aircraft, the retirement of      aircraft and global flying hours, which impacts business and general aviation aircraft utilization rates. Operating results in our Defense and Space Systems business unit may be affected by the mix of U.S. and foreign government appropriations for defense and space programs. Operating results in our      Transportation Systems business unit may be affected by the level of production and demand for automobiles and trucks equipped with turbochargers, regulatory changes regarding automobile and truck emissions and fuel economy, consumer demand and spending for automotive aftermarket products and      delays in launch schedules for new automobile and truck platforms.              Automation and Control SolutionsOperating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in the level of global residential and commercial construction (including retrofits and upgrades), capital spending and operating expenditures on building and process automation, industrial plant capacity      utilization and expansion, and inventory levels in distribution channels.              Performance Materials and TechnologiesOperating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in the capacity utilization for chemical, industrial, refining, petrochemical and semiconductor plants, our customers availability of capital for refinery construction and expansion, raw material demand and      supply volatility, and our ability to maximize our facilities production capacity and minimize downtime. Pricing of certain chemical products are driven by 6          raw materials that are correlated to the price of oil, hence revenue could be significantly impacted by volatility in the price of oil.An increasing percentage of our sales and operations is in non-U.S. jurisdictions and is subject to the economic, political, regulatory, foreign exchange and other risks of international operations.Our international operations, including U.S. exports, represent more than half of the Companys sales. Risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations, wage and price controls, employment regulations, foreign investment laws, import, export and other trade restrictions (such as  embargoes), violations by our employees of anti-corruption laws (despite our efforts to mitigate these risks), changes in regulations regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises, nationalization of private enterprises, acts of terrorism, and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety  of our employees in these regions. Instability and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment and the cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide can impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing or other strategies for growing our  businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins.Operating outside of the United States also exposes us to foreign exchange risk, which we monitor and seek to reduce through hedging activities. However, foreign exchange hedging activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us or successful in eliminating such volatility. Finally, we  generate significant amounts of cash outside of the United States that is invested with financial and non-financial counterparties. While we employ comprehensive controls regarding global cash management to guard against cash or investment loss and to ensure our ability to fund our operations and  commitments, a material disruption to the counterparties with whom we transact business could expose Honeywell to financial loss.A change in the level of U.S. Government defense and space funding or the mix of programs to which such funding is allocated could adversely impact Aerospaces defense and space sales and results of operations.A shift in defense or space spending to programs in which we do not participate and/or reductions in funding for or termination of existing programs could adversely impact our results of operations.Risks related to our defined benefit pension plans may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow.Significant changes in actual investment return on pension assets, discount rates, and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and require cash pension contributions in future periods. Changes in discount rates and actual asset returns different than our anticipated asset returns can  result in significant non-cash actuarial gains or losses which we record in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and, if applicable, in any quarter in which an interim re-measurement is triggered. With regard to cash pension contributions, funding requirements for our pension plans are largely dependent upon  interest rates, actual investment returns on pension assets and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations.Operational RisksRaw material price fluctuations, the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements, or catastrophic events can increase the cost of our products and services, impact our ability to meet commitments to customers and cause us to incur significant liabilities.The cost of raw materials is a key element in the cost of our products, particularly in PMT (cumene, fluorspar, R240, natural gas, perchloroethylene, sulfur and ethylene) and Aerospace (nickel, steel, titanium and other metals). Our inability to offset material price inflation through increased prices7 to customers, formula or long-term fixed price contracts with suppliers, productivity actions or through commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations.Many major components, product equipment items and raw materials, particularly in Aerospace, are procured or subcontracted on a single or sole-source basis. Although we maintain a qualification and performance surveillance process and we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and  components are generally adequate, it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases may have in the future. Our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers inability to scale production and adjust delivery of long-lead time products during times  of volatile demand. Our inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts, which could, in turn, result in reduced sales and profits, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships.Failure to increase productivity through sustainable operational improvements, as well as an inability to successfully execute repositioning projects, may reduce our profitability or adversely impact our businesses.Our profitability and margin growth are dependent upon our ability to drive sustainable improvements. In addition, we seek productivity and cost savings benefits through repositioning actions and projects, such as consolidation of manufacturing facilities, transitions to cost-competitive regions and product line  rationalizations. Risks associated with these actions include delays in execution of the planned initiatives, additional unexpected costs, adverse effects on employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to employee attrition. We may not realize the full operational or financial benefits we expect,  the recognition of these benefits may be delayed and these actions may potentially disrupt our operations.Our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance in highly competitive markets with acceptable margins.Our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to (i) identify emerging technological trends in our target end-markets, (ii) develop and maintain competitive products, (iii) enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our  competitors and prevent commoditization of our products, (iv) develop, manufacture and bring new products to market quickly and cost-effectively, and (v) develop and retain individuals with the requisite technical expertise and understanding of customers needs to develop new technologies and introduce new  products.The failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects.We may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisitions, and divestitures may not occur as planned.We regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest non-core businesses. We may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis or at all.

Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking StatementsWe have described many of the trends and other factors that drive our business and future results in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, including the overview of the Company and each of our segments and the discussion of their respective  economic and other factors and areas of focus for 2014. These sections and other parts of this report (including this Item 1A) contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.Forward-looking statements are those that address activities, events or developments that management intends, expects, projects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future. They are based on managements assumptions and assessments in light of past experience and trends, current economic  and industry conditions, expected future developments and other relevant factors. They are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results, developments and business decisions may differ significantly from those envisaged by our forward-looking statements. We do not undertake to update or revise  any of our forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that can affect our performance in both the near-and long-term. These forward-looking statements should be considered in light of the information included in this Form 10-K, including, in particular,  the factors discussed below.Risk Factors
Our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition are subject to the risks and uncertainties set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results.Industry and economic conditions may adversely affect the markets and operating conditions of our customers, which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations.The operating results of our segments are impacted by general global industry and economic conditions that can cause changes in spending and capital investment patterns, demand for our products and services and the level of our manufacturing and shipping costs. The operating results of our Aerospace  segment, which generated 31 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2013, are directly tied to cyclical industry and economic conditions, including global demand for air travel as reflected in new aircraft production, the deferral or cancellation of orders for new aircraft, delays in launch schedules for new aircraft  platforms, the retirement of aircraft, global flying hours, and business and general aviation aircraft utilization rates, as well as changes in customer buying patterns with respect to aftermarket parts, supplier consolidation, factory transitions, capacity constraints, and the level and mix of U.S. and foreign government  appropriations for defense and space programs (as further discussed in other risk factors below). The challenging operating environment faced by the commercial airline industry may be influenced by a wide variety of factors including global flying hours, aircraft fuel prices, labor issues, airline consolidation, airline  insolvencies, terrorism and safety concerns as well as changes in regulations. Future terrorist actions or pandemic health issues could dramatically reduce both the demand for air travel and our Aerospace aftermarket sales and margins. The operating results of our Automation and Control Solutions (ACS)  segment, which generated 42 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2013, are impacted by the level of global residential and commercial construction (including retrofits and upgrades), capital spending and operating expenditures on building and process automation, industrial plant capacity utilization and  expansion, inventory levels in distribution channels, and global economic growth rates. Performance Materials and Technologies operating results, which generated 17 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2013, are impacted by global economic growth rates, capacity utilization for chemical, industrial, refining,  petrochemical and semiconductor plants, our customers availability of capital for refinery construction and expansion, and raw material demand and supply volatility. Transportation Systems operating results, which generated 10 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2013, are impacted by global production  and demand for14automobiles and trucks equipped with turbochargers, and regulatory changes regarding automobile and truck emissions and fuel economy, delays in launch schedules for new automotive platforms, and consumer demand and spending for automotive aftermarket products. Demand of global automotive and truck  manufacturers will continue to be influenced by a wide variety of factors, including ability of consumers to obtain financing, ability to reduce operating costs and overall consumer and business confidence. Each of the segments is impacted by volatility in raw material prices (as further described below) and non-  material inflation.Raw material price fluctuations, the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements, or catastrophic events can increase the cost of our products and services, impact our ability to meet commitments to customers and cause us to incur significant liabilities.The cost of raw materials is a key element in the cost of our products, particularly in our Performance Materials and Technologies (cumene, fluorspar, R240, natural gas, perchloroethylene, sulfur and ethylene), Transportation Systems (nickel, steel and other metals) and Aerospace (nickel, titanium and other  metals) segments. Our inability to offset material price inflation through increased prices to customers, formula or long-term fixed price contracts with suppliers, productivity actions or through commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations.Our manufacturing operations are also highly dependent upon the delivery of materials (including raw materials) by outside suppliers and their assembly of major components, and subsystems used in our products in a timely manner and in full compliance with purchase order terms and conditions, quality  standards, and applicable laws and regulations. In addition, many major components, product equipment items and raw materials are procured or subcontracted on a single-source basis with a number of domestic and foreign companies; in some circumstances these suppliers are the sole source of the  component or equipment. Although we maintain a qualification and performance surveillance process to control risk associated with such reliance on third parties and we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate, it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price  increases may have in the future. Our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers inability to scale production and adjust delivery of long-lead time products during times of volatile demand. Our suppliers may fail to perform according to specifications as and  when required and we may be unable to identify alternate suppliers or to otherwise mitigate the consequences of their non-performance. The supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by suppliers decisions to exit certain businesses, bankruptcy and by external events such as natural disasters,  extreme weather events, pandemic health issues, terrorist actions, labor disputes, governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes (e.g., product certification or stewardship requirements, sourcing restrictions, product authenticity, climate change or greenhouse gas emission standards, etc.). Our  inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts, which could, in turn, result in reduced sales and profits, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships. Transitions to new suppliers may result in significant costs  and delays, including those related to the required recertification of parts obtained from new suppliers with our customers and/or regulatory agencies. In addition, because our businesses cannot always immediately adapt their cost structure to changing market conditions, our manufacturing capacity for certain  products may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements, which could adversely impact our operating costs, profitability and customer and supplier relationships.Our facilities, distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to, among other things, fire, flood, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters. If any of these facilities or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, result in  personal injury or property damage, damage relationships with our customers and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facilities or systems, as well as result in other liabilities and adverse impacts. The same risk could also arise from the failure of critical systems supplied by Honeywell to large  industrial, refining and petrochemical customers.15Failure to increase productivity through sustainable operational improvements, as well as an inability to successfully execute repositioning projects, may reduce our profitability or adversely impact our businessesOur profitability and margin growth are dependent upon our ability to drive sustainable improvements through the Honeywell Enablers. In addition, we seek productivity and cost savings benefits through repositioning actions and projects, such as consolidation of manufacturing facilities, transitions to cost-  competitive regions and product line rationalizations. Risks associated with these actions include delays in execution of the planned initiatives, additional unexpected costs, adverse effects on employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to employee attrition. Many of the restructuring actions  are complex and difficult to implement. Hence, we may not realize the full operational or financial benefits we expected, the recognition of these benefits may be delayed and these actions may potentially disrupt our operations. See Note 3 Repositioning and Other Charges of Notes to the Financial Statements in  Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data for a summary of our repositioning actions.Our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins.Our businesses operate in global markets that are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and evolving industry standards. Accordingly, our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to (i) identify emerging technological trends in our target end-markets, (ii) develop and  maintain competitive products, (iii) enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization of our products, (iv) develop, manufacture and bring products to market quickly and cost-effectively, and (v) develop and retain  individuals with the requisite expertise.Our ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect our competitive position and requires the investment of significant resources. These development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses, and they may not lead to the development of new  technologies or products on a timely basis or that meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings. In addition, the markets for our products may not develop or grow as we currently anticipate. The failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings  by our competitors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects.Protecting our intellectual property is critical to our innovation efforts.We own or are licensed under a large number of U.S. and non-U.S. patents and patent applications, trademarks and copyrights. Our intellectual property rights may expire or be challenged, invalidated or infringed upon by third parties or we may be unable to maintain, renew or enter into new licenses of third  party proprietary intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms. In some non-U.S. countries, laws affecting intellectual property are uncertain in their application, which can affect the scope or enforceability of our patents and other intellectual property rights. Any of these events or factors could diminish  or cause us to lose the competitive advantages associated with our intellectual property, subject us to judgments, penalties and significant litigation costs, and/or temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or services.Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations.Global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology (IT) systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company and/or its third party service providers.  While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats and incidents, none of them to date have been material to the Company. Although we employ comprehensive measures to prevent, detect, address and mitigate these threats (including access16controls, data encryption, vulnerability assessments, continuous monitoring of our IT networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems), cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of  critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include reputational damage, litigation with third parties, diminution in the value of our investment in research,  development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations.An increasing percentage of our sales and operations is in non-U.S. jurisdictions and is subject to the economic, political, regulatory and other risks of international operations.Our international operations, including U.S. exports, comprise a growing proportion of our operating results. Our strategy calls for increasing sales to and operations in overseas markets, including developing markets such as China, India, the Middle East and other high growth regions.In 2013, approximately 55 percent of our total sales (including products manufactured in the U.S. and sold outside the U.S. as well as products manufactured in international locations) were outside of the U.S. including approximately 29 percent in Europe and approximately 13 percent in Asia. Risks related to  international operations include exchange control regulations, wage and price controls, employment regulations, foreign investment laws, import, export and other trade restrictions (such as embargoes), changes in regulations regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises, nationalization of private  enterprises, government instability, acts of terrorism, and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions. We are also subject to U.S. laws prohibiting companies from doing business in certain countries, or restricting the type of business that may be  conducted in these countries. The cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide can also impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable  operating margins.With more than half of the Companys sales generated internationally, global economic conditions can have a significant impact on our total sales. Uncertain global economic conditions arising from a tepid recovery in the Euro zone and varying rates of growth in emerging regions could reduce customer  confidence that results in decreased demand for our products and services, disruption in payment patterns and higher default rates, a tightening of credit markets (see risk factor below regarding volatility of credit markets for further discussion) and increased risk regarding supplier performance. Volatility in  exchange rates of emerging market currencies present uncertainties that complicate planning and could unexpectedly impact our profitability, presenting increased counterparty risk with respect to the financial institutions with whom we do business. While we employ comprehensive controls regarding global cash  management to guard against cash or investment loss and to ensure our ability to fund our operations and commitments, a material disruption to the financial institutions with whom we transact business could expose Honeywell to financial loss.Sales and purchases in currencies other than the US dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the US dollar and may adversely affect our results of operations. Currency fluctuations may affect product demand and prices we pay for materials, as a result, our operating margins may be  negatively impacted. Fluctuations in exchange rates may give rise to translation gains or losses when financial statements of our non-U.S. businesses are translated into U.S. dollars. While we monitor our exchange rate exposures and seek to reduce the risk of volatility through hedging activities, such activities  bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us or successful in significantly mitigating such volatility.Volatility of credit markets or macro-economic factors could adversely affect our business.Changes in U.S. and global financial and equity markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity, and interest rate volatility, may increase the cost of financing as well as the risks of refinancing maturing debt. In addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term ratings assigned by  independent rating agencies. A decrease in these ratings could increase our cost of borrowing.17Delays in our customers ability to obtain financing, or the unavailability of financing to our customers, could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow. The inability of our suppliers to obtain financing could result in the need to transition to alternate suppliers, which could result in significant  incremental cost and delay, as discussed above. Lastly, disruptions in the U.S. and global financial markets could impact the financial institutions with which we do business.We may be required to recognize impairment charges for our long-lived assets or available for sale investments.At December 31, 2013, the net carrying value of long-lived assets (property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets) and available for sale securities totaled approximately $20.8 billion and $0.8 billion, respectively. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we  periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in impairments to goodwill and other  long-lived assets. An other than temporary decline in the market value of our available for sale securities may also result in an impairment charge. Future impairment charges could significantly affect our results of operations in the periods recognized. Impairment charges would also reduce our consolidated  shareowners equity and increase our debt-to-total-capitalization ratio, which could negatively impact our credit rating and access to the public debt and equity markets.A change in the level of U.S. Government defense and space funding or the mix of programs to which such funding is allocated could adversely impact Aerospaces defense and space sales and results of operations.Sales of our defense and space-related products and services are largely dependent upon government budgets, particularly the U.S. defense budget. Sales as a prime contractor and subcontractor to the U.S. Department of Defense comprised approximately 25 percent and 8 percent of Aerospace and total  sales, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2013. We cannot predict the extent to which total funding and/or funding for individual programs will be included, increased or reduced as part of the 2014 and subsequent budgets ultimately approved by Congress, or be included in the scope of separate  supplemental appropriations. We also cannot predict the impact of potential changes in priorities due to military transformation and planning and/or the nature of war-related activity on existing, follow-on or replacement programs. A shift in defense or space spending to programs in which we do not participate  and/or reductions in funding for or termination of existing programs could adversely impact our results of operations.As a supplier of military and other equipment to the U.S. Government, we are subject to unusual risks, such as the right of the U.S. Government to terminate contracts for convenience and to conduct audits and investigations of our operations and performance.In addition to normal business risks, companies like Honeywell that supply military and other equipment to the U.S. Government are subject to unusual risks, including dependence on Congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of funds, changes in governmental procurement legislation and  regulations and other policies that reflect military and political developments, significant changes in contract requirements, complexity of designs and the rapidity with which they become obsolete, necessity for frequent design improvements, intense competition for U.S. Government business necessitating  increases in time and investment for design and development, difficulty of forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on developmental and highly sophisticated technical work, and other factors characteristic of the industry, such as contract award protests and delays in the timing of contract approvals.  Changes are customary over the life of U.S. Government contracts, particularly development contracts, and generally result in adjustments to contract prices and schedules.Our contracts with the U.S. Government are also subject to various government audits. Like many other government contractors, we have received audit reports that recommend downward price adjustments to certain contracts or changes to certain accounting systems or controls to comply with18various government regulations. When appropriate and prudent, we have made adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in the past and may do so in the future.U.S. Government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform consistent with the terms of the applicable contract. In the case of a termination for convenience, we are typically entitled to reimbursement for our allowable  costs incurred, plus termination costs and a reasonable profit. If a contract is terminated by the government for our failure to perform we could be liable for reprocurement costs incurred by the government in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and for other damages suffered by the  government as permitted under the contract.We are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations. If, as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations (including violations of certain environmental or export laws), Honeywell or one of its businesses were  found to have violated applicable law, it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts, suspended from contract performance pending the completion of legal proceedings and/or have its export privileges suspended. The U.S. Government also reserves the right to debar a  contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent, criminal or other egregious misconduct. Debarment generally does not exceed three years.Our reputation and ability to do business may be impacted by the improper conduct of employees, vendors, agents or business partners.We cannot ensure that our extensive compliance controls, policies and procedures will, in all instances, protect us from reckless, unethical or criminal acts committed by our employees, vendors, agents or business partners that would violate the laws of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates,  including laws governing payments to government officials, competition, data privacy and rights of employees. Any improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could adversely impact our ability to conduct business, results of operations and  reputation.Changes in legislation or government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations.The sales and margins of each of our segments are directly impacted by government regulations. Safety and performance regulations (including mandates of the Federal Aviation Administration and other similar international regulatory bodies requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft), product  certification requirements and government procurement practices can impact Aerospace sales, research and development expenditures, operating costs and profitability. The demand for and cost of providing Automation and Control Solutions products, services and solutions can be impacted by fire, security,  safety, health care, environmental and energy efficiency standards and regulations. Performance Materials and Technologies results of operations can be affected by environmental (e.g. government regulation of fluorocarbons), safety and energy efficiency standards and regulations, while emissions, fuel  economy and energy efficiency standards and regulations can impact the demand for turbochargers in our Transportation Systems segment. Honeywell sells products that address safety and environmental regulation and a substantial portion of our portfolio is dedicated to energy efficient products and services.  Legislation or regulations regarding areas such as labor and employment, employee benefit plans, tax, health, safety and environmental matters, import, export and trade, intellectual property, product certification, and product liability may impact the results of each of our operating segments and our consolidated  results.Completed acquisitions may not perform as anticipated or be integrated as planned, and divestitures may not occur as planned.We regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest non-core businesses. We may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis or at all. In addition, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted19by (i) the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns, (ii) the discovery of unanticipated issues or liabilities, (iii) the failure to integrate acquired businesses into Honeywell on schedule and/or to achieve synergies in the planned amount or within the expected timeframe, (iv) the inability to  dispose of non-core assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions and within the expected timeframe, and (v) the degree of protection provided by indemnities from sellers of acquired companies and the obligations under indemnities provided to purchasers of our divested businesses.We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters, government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties.We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and  divestitures, employment, employee benefits plans, intellectual property, antitrust, import and export matters and environmental, health and safety matters. Resolution of these matters can be prolonged and costly, and the ultimate results or judgments are uncertain due to the inherent uncertainty in litigation and  other proceedings. Moreover, our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, and we may become subject to or be required to pay damage awards or settlements that could have a material adverse effect  on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities. It also is not possible to obtain insurance to protect against all our operational  risks and liabilities. The incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and financial condition.Our operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities.Mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to claims of personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures. We  have incurred remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental  matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations can impose substantial fines and  criminal sanctions for violations, and require installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. We incur, and expect to continue to incur, capital and operating costs to comply with these laws and regulations. In  addition, changes in laws, regulations and enforcement of policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites, the establishment of stricter state or federal toxicity standards with respect to certain contaminants, or the imposition of new clean-up  requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations.Our expenses include significant costs related to employee and retiree health benefits.With approximately 131,000 employees, including approximately 51,000 in the U.S., our expenses relating to employee health and retiree health benefits are significant. In recent years, we have experienced significant increases in certain of these costs, largely as a result of economic factors beyond our  control, in particular, ongoing increases in health care costs well in excess of the rate of inflation. Continued increasing health-care costs, legislative or regulatory changes, and volatility in20discount rates, as well as changes in other assumptions used to calculate retiree health benefit expenses, may adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.Risks related to our defined benefit pension plans may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow.Significant changes in actual investment return on pension assets, discount rates, and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and pension contributions in future periods. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using  actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and interest rates, which may change based on economic conditions. Funding requirements for our U.S. pension plans may become more significant. However, the ultimate amounts to be contributed are dependent upon, among  other things, interest rates, underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations. For a discussion regarding the significant assumptions used to estimate pension expense, including discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan  assets, and how our financial statements can be affected by pension plan accounting policies, see Critical Accounting Policies included in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.Additional tax expense or additional tax exposures could affect our future profitability.We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and various non-U.S. jurisdictions. Our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent, in part, upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions. In 2013, our tax expense represented 26.8 percent of our income before tax.  Our tax expense includes estimates of tax reserves and reflects other estimates and assumptions, including assessments of future earnings of the Company which could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets. Our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate  as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the overall profitability of the Company, changes in tax legislation and rates, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the  amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures"

Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking StatementsWe have described many of the trends and other factors that drive our business and future results in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, including the overview of the Company and each of our segments and the discussion of their respective  economic and other factors and areas of focus for 2013. These sections and other parts of this report (including this Item 1A) contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.Forward-looking statements are those that address activities, events or developments that management intends, expects, projects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future. They are based on managements assumptions and assessments in light of past experience and trends, current economic  and industry conditions, expected future developments and other relevant factors. They are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results, developments and business decisions may differ significantly from those envisaged by our forward-looking statements. We do not undertake to update or revise  any of our forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that can affect our performance in both the near-and long-term. These forward-looking statements should be considered in light of the information included in this Form 10-K, including, in particular,  the factors discussed below.Risk Factors
Our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition are subject to the risks and uncertainties set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results.Industry and economic conditions may adversely affect the markets and operating conditions of our customers, which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations.The operating results of our segments are impacted by general global industry and economic conditions that can cause changes in spending and capital investment patterns, demand for our products and services and the level of our manufacturing and shipping costs. The operating results of our Aerospace  segment, which generated 32 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2012, are directly tied to cyclical industry and economic conditions, including global demand for air travel as reflected in new aircraft production, the deferral or cancellation of orders for new aircraft, delays in launch schedules for new aircraft  platforms, the retirement of aircraft, global flying hours, and business and general aviation aircraft utilization rates, as well as changes in customer buying patterns with respect to aftermarket parts, supplier consolidation, factory transitions, capacity constraints, and the level and mix of U.S. and foreign government  appropriations for defense and space programs (as further discussed in other risk factors below). The challenging operating environment faced by the commercial airline industry may be influenced by a wide variety of factors including global flying hours, aircraft fuel prices, labor issues, airline consolidation, airline  insolvencies, terrorism and safety concerns as well as changes in regulations. Future terrorist actions or pandemic health issues could dramatically reduce both the demand for air travel and our Aerospace aftermarket sales and margins. The operating results of our Automation and Control Solutions (ACS)  segment, which generated 42 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2012, are impacted by the level of global residential and commercial construction (including retrofits and upgrades), capital spending and operating expenditures on building and process automation, industrial plant capacity utilization and  expansion, inventory levels in distribution channels, and global economic growth rates. Performance Materials and Technologies operating results, which generated 16 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2012, are impacted by global economic growth rates, capacity utilization for chemical, industrial, refining,  petrochemical and semiconductor plants, our customers availability of capital for refinery construction and expansion, and raw material demand and supply volatility. Transportation Systems operating results, which generated 10 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2012, are impacted by global production  and demand for12automobiles and trucks equipped with turbochargers, and regulatory changes regarding automobile and truck emissions and fuel economy, delays in launch schedules for new automotive platforms, and consumer demand and spending for automotive aftermarket products. Demand of global automotive and truck  manufacturers will continue to be influenced by a wide variety of factors, including ability of consumers to obtain financing, ability to reduce operating costs and overall consumer and business confidence. Each of the segments is impacted by volatility in raw material prices (as further described below) and non-  material inflation.Raw material price fluctuations, the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements, or catastrophic events can increase the cost of our products and services, impact our ability to meet commitments to customers and cause us to incur significant liabilities.The cost of raw materials is a key element in the cost of our products, particularly in our Performance Materials and Technologies (cumene, fluorspar, perchloroethylene, R240, natural gas, sulfur and ethylene), Transportation Systems (nickel, steel and other metals) and Aerospace (nickel, titanium and other  metals) segments. Our inability to offset material price inflation through increased prices to customers, formula or long-term fixed price contracts with suppliers, productivity actions or through commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations.Our manufacturing operations are also highly dependent upon the delivery of materials (including raw materials) by outside suppliers and their assembly of major components, and subsystems used in our products in a timely manner and in full compliance with purchase order terms and conditions, quality  standards, and applicable laws and regulations. In addition, many major components, product equipment items and raw materials are procured or subcontracted on a single-source basis with a number of domestic and foreign companies; in some circumstances these suppliers are the sole source of the  component or equipment. Although we maintain a qualification and performance surveillance process to control risk associated with such reliance on third parties and we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate, it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price  increases may have in the future. Our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers inability to scale production and adjust delivery of long-lead time products during times of volatile demand. Our suppliers may fail to perform according to specifications as and  when required and we may be unable to identify alternate suppliers or to otherwise mitigate the consequences of their non-performance. The supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by suppliers decisions to exit certain businesses, bankruptcy and by external events such as natural disasters,  extreme weather events, pandemic health issues, terrorist actions, labor disputes, governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes (e.g., product certification or stewardship requirements, sourcing restrictions, product authenticity, climate change or greenhouse gas emission standards, etc.). Our  inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts, which could, in turn, result in reduced sales and profits, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships. Transitions to new suppliers may result in significant costs  and delays, including those related to the required recertification of parts obtained from new suppliers with our customers and/or regulatory agencies. In addition, because our businesses cannot always immediately adapt their cost structure to changing market conditions, our manufacturing capacity for certain  products may at times exceed or fall short of our production requirements, which could adversely impact our operating costs, profitability and customer and supplier relationships.Our facilities, distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to, among other things, fire, flood, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters. If any of these facilities or systems were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, result in  personal injury or property damage, damage relationships with our customers and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facilities or systems, as well as result in other liabilities and adverse impacts. The same risk could also arise from the failure of critical systems supplied by Honeywell to large  industrial, refining and petrochemical customers.13Our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins.Our businesses operate in global markets that are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and evolving industry standards. Accordingly, our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to (i) identify emerging technological trends in our target end-markets, (ii) develop and  maintain competitive products, (iii) enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization of our products, (iv) develop, manufacture and bring products to market quickly and cost-effectively, and (v) develop and retain  individuals with the requisite expertise.Our ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect our competitive position and requires the investment of significant resources. These development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses, and they may not lead to the development of new  technologies or products on a timely basis or that meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings. In addition, the markets for our products may not develop or grow as we currently anticipate. The failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings  by our competitors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects.Protecting our intellectual property is critical to our innovation efforts.We own or are licensed under a large number of U.S. and non-U.S. patents and patent applications, trademarks and copyrights. Our intellectual property rights may expire or be challenged, invalidated or infringed upon by third parties or we may be unable to maintain, renew or enter into new licenses of third  party proprietary intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms. In some non-U.S. countries, laws affecting intellectual property are uncertain in their application, which can affect the scope or enforceability of our patents and other intellectual property rights. Any of these events or factors could diminish  or cause us to lose the competitive advantages associated with our intellectual property, subject us to judgments, penalties and significant litigation costs, and/or temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or services.Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations.Global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology (IT) systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company and/or its third party service providers.  While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats and incidents, none of them to date have been material to the Company. Although we employ comprehensive measures to prevent, detect, address and mitigate these threats (including access controls, data encryption,  vulnerability assessments, continuous monitoring of our IT networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems), cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and  confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include reputational damage, litigation with third parties, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and  engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations.An increasing percentage of our sales and operations is in non-U.S. jurisdictions and is subject to the economic, political, regulatory and other risks of international operations.Our international operations, including U.S. exports, comprise a growing proportion of our operating results. Our strategy calls for increasing sales to and operations in overseas markets, including developing markets such as China, India, the Middle East and other high growth regions.14In 2012, approximately 55 percent of our total sales (including products manufactured in the U.S. and sold outside the U.S. as well as products manufactured in international locations) were outside of the U.S. including approximately 28 percent in Europe and approximately 13 percent in Asia. Risks related to  international operations include exchange control regulations, wage and price controls, employment regulations, foreign investment laws, import, export and other trade restrictions (such as embargoes), changes in regulations regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises, nationalization of private  enterprises, government instability, acts of terrorism, and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions. We are also subject to U.S. laws prohibiting companies from doing business in certain countries, or restricting the type of business that may be  conducted in these countries. The cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide can also impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable  operating margins.Uncertain global economic conditions arising from circumstances such as sovereign debt issues, slowing growth in emerging regions and credit rating downgrades in certain European countries or speculation regarding changes to the composition or viability of the Euro zone could result in reduced customer  confidence resulting in decreased demand for our products and services, disruption in payment patterns and higher default rates, a tightening of credit markets (see risk factor below regarding volatility of credit markets for further discussion), increased risk regarding supplier performance, increased counterparty  risk with respect to the financial institutions with which we do business, and exchange rate fluctuations. While we employ comprehensive controls regarding global cash management to guard against cash or investment loss and to ensure our ability to fund our operations and commitments, a material disruption to  the financial institutions with whom we transact business could expose Honeywell to financial loss.Sales and purchases in currencies other than the US dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the US dollar and may adversely affect our results of operations. Currency fluctuations may affect product demand and prices we pay for materials, as a result, our operating margins may be  negatively impacted. Fluctuations in exchange rates may give rise to translation gains or losses when financial statements of our non-U.S. businesses are translated into U.S. dollars. While we monitor our exchange rate exposures and seek to reduce the risk of volatility through hedging activities, such activities  bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us or successful in significantly mitigating such volatility.Volatility of credit markets or macro-economic factors could adversely affect our business.Changes in U.S. and global financial and equity markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity, and interest rate volatility, may increase the cost of financing as well as the risks of refinancing maturing debt. In addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term ratings assigned by  independent rating agencies. A decrease in these ratings could increase our cost of borrowing.Delays in our customers ability to obtain financing, or the unavailability of financing to our customers, could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow. The inability of our suppliers to obtain financing could result in the need to transition to alternate suppliers, which could result in significant  incremental cost and delay, as discussed above. Lastly, disruptions in the U.S. and global financial markets could impact the financial institutions with which we do business.We may be required to recognize impairment charges for our long-lived assets or available for sale investments.At December 31, 2012, the net carrying value of long-lived assets (property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets) and available for sale securities totaled approximately $19.9 billion and $0.5 billion, respectively. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we  periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in impairments to goodwill and other  long-lived assets. An other than temporary decline in the market value of our available for15sale securities may also result in an impairment charge. Future impairment charges could significantly affect our results of operations in the periods recognized. Impairment charges would also reduce our consolidated shareowners equity and increase our debt-to-total-capitalization ratio, which could negatively  impact our credit rating and access to the public debt and equity markets.A change in the level of U.S. Government defense and space funding or the mix of programs to which such funding is allocated could adversely impact Aerospaces defense and space sales and results of operations.Sales of our defense and space-related products and services are largely dependent upon government budgets, particularly the U.S. defense budget. Sales as a prime contractor and subcontractor to the U.S. Department of Defense comprised approximately 27 and 9 percent of Aerospace and total sales,  respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2012. We cannot predict the extent to which total funding and/or funding for individual programs will be included, increased or reduced as part of the 2013 and subsequent budgets ultimately approved by Congress, or be included in the scope of separate  supplemental appropriations. We also cannot predict the impact of potential changes in priorities due to military transformation and planning and/or the nature of war-related activity on existing, follow-on or replacement programs. A shift in defense or space spending to programs in which we do not participate  and/or reductions in funding for or termination of existing programs could adversely impact our results of operations.As a supplier of military and other equipment to the U.S. Government, we are subject to unusual risks, such as the right of the U.S. Government to terminate contracts for convenience and to conduct audits and investigations of our operations and performance.In addition to normal business risks, companies like Honeywell that supply military and other equipment to the U.S. Government are subject to unusual risks, including dependence on Congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of funds, changes in governmental procurement legislation and  regulations and other policies that reflect military and political developments, significant changes in contract requirements, complexity of designs and the rapidity with which they become obsolete, necessity for frequent design improvements, intense competition for U.S. Government business necessitating  increases in time and investment for design and development, difficulty of forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on developmental and highly sophisticated technical work, and other factors characteristic of the industry, such as contract award protests and delays in the timing of contract approvals.  Changes are customary over the life of U.S. Government contracts, particularly development contracts, and generally result in adjustments to contract prices and schedules.Our contracts with the U.S. Government are also subject to various government audits. Like many other government contractors, we have received audit reports that recommend downward price adjustments to certain contracts or changes to certain accounting systems or controls to comply with various  government regulations. When appropriate and prudent, we have made adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in the past and may do so in the future.U.S. Government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform consistent with the terms of the applicable contract. In the case of a termination for convenience, we are typically entitled to reimbursement for our allowable  costs incurred, plus termination costs and a reasonable profit. If a contract is terminated by the government for our failure to perform we could be liable for reprocurement costs incurred by the government in acquiring undelivered goods or services from another source and for other damages suffered by the  government as permitted under the contract.We are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations. If, as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations (including violations of certain environmental or export laws), Honeywell or one of its businesses were  found to have violated applicable law, it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts, suspended from contract performance pending the completion of legal proceedings and/or have its export privileges suspended. The U.S. Government16also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent, criminal or other egregious misconduct. Debarment generally does not exceed three years.Our reputation and ability to do business may be impacted by the improper conduct of employees, vendors, agents or business partners.We cannot ensure that our extensive compliance controls, policies and procedures will, in all instances, protect us from reckless, unethical or criminal acts committed by our employees, vendors, agents or business partners that would violate the laws of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates,  including laws governing payments to government officials, competition, data privacy and rights of employees. Any improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could adversely impact our ability to conduct business, results of operations and  reputation.Changes in legislation or government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations.The sales and margins of each of our segments are directly impacted by government regulations. Safety and performance regulations (including mandates of the Federal Aviation Administration and other similar international regulatory bodies requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft), product  certification requirements and government procurement practices can impact Aerospace sales, research and development expenditures, operating costs and profitability. The demand for and cost of providing Automation and Control Solutions products, services and solutions can be impacted by fire, security,  safety, health care, environmental and energy efficiency standards and regulations. Performance Materials and Technologies results of operations can be affected by environmental (e.g. government regulation of fluorocarbons), safety and energy efficiency standards and regulations, while emissions, fuel  economy and energy efficiency standards and regulations can impact the demand for turbochargers in our Transportation Systems segment. Honeywell sells products that address safety and environmental regulation and a substantial portion of our portfolio is dedicated to energy efficient products and services.  Legislation or regulations regarding areas such as labor and employment, employee benefit plans, tax, health, safety and environmental matters, import, export and trade, intellectual property, product certification, and product liability may impact the results of each of our operating segments and our consolidated  results.Completed acquisitions may not perform as anticipated or be integrated as planned, and divestitures may not occur as planned.We regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest non-core businesses. We may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis or at all. In addition, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by (i)  the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns, (ii) the discovery of unanticipated issues or liabilities, (iii) the failure to integrate acquired businesses into Honeywell on schedule and/or to achieve synergies in the planned amount or within the expected timeframe, (iv) the inability to dispose  of non-core assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions and within the expected timeframe, and (v) the degree of protection provided by indemnities from sellers of acquired companies and the obligations under indemnities provided to purchasers of our divested businesses.We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters, government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties.We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and  divestitures, employment, employee benefits plans, intellectual property, antitrust, import and export matters and environmental, health and safety matters. Resolution of these matters can be17prolonged and costly, and the ultimate results or judgments are uncertain due to the inherent uncertainty in litigation and other proceedings. Moreover, our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, and  we may become subject to or be required to pay damage awards or settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total  amount of all insured claims and liabilities. It also is not possible to obtain insurance to protect against all our operational risks and liabilities. The incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and  financial condition.Our operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities.Mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to claims of personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures. We  have incurred remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental  matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations can impose substantial fines and  criminal sanctions for violations, and require installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. We incur, and expect to continue to incur, capital and operating costs to comply with these laws and regulations. In  addition, changes in laws, regulations and enforcement of policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites, the establishment of stricter state or federal toxicity standards with respect to certain contaminants, or the imposition of new clean-up  requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations.Our expenses include significant costs related to employee and retiree health benefits.With approximately 132,000 employees, including approximately 52,000 in the U.S., our expenses relating to employee health and retiree health benefits are significant. In recent years, we have experienced significant increases in certain of these costs, largely as a result of economic factors beyond our  control, in particular, ongoing increases in health care costs well in excess of the rate of inflation. Continued increasing health-care costs, legislative or regulatory changes, and volatility in discount rates, as well as changes in other assumptions used to calculate retiree health benefit expenses, may adversely  affect our financial position and results of operations.Risks related to our defined benefit pension plans may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow.Significant changes in actual investment return on pension assets, discount rates, and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and pension contributions in future periods. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using  actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and interest rates, which may change based on economic conditions. Funding requirements for our U.S. pension plans may become more significant. However, the ultimate amounts to be contributed are dependent upon, among  other things, interest rates, underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations. For a discussion regarding the significant assumptions used to estimate pension expense, including discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan  assets, and how our financial statements can be affected by pension plan18accounting policies, see Critical Accounting Policies included in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.Additional tax expense or additional tax exposures could affect our future profitability.We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and various non-U.S. jurisdictions, and our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions. In 2012, our tax expense represented 24.4 percent of our income before tax, and  includes estimates of additional tax which may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various estimates and assumptions, including assessments of future earnings of the Company, that could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets. Our future results of operations could be adversely affected by  changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the overall profitability of the Company, changes in tax legislation and rates, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets  and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures"

Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking StatementsWe have described many of the trends and other factors that drive our business and future results in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, including the overview of the Company and each of our segments and the discussion of their respective  economic and other factors and areas of focus for 2010. These sections and other parts of this report (including this Item 1A) contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.Forward-looking statements are those that address activities, events or developments that management intends, expects, projects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future. They are based on managements assumptions and assessments in light of past experience and trends, current economic  and industry conditions, expected future developments and other relevant factors. They are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results, developments and business decisions may differ significantly from those envisaged by our forward-looking statements. We do not undertake to update or revise  any of our forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that can affect our performance in both the near-and long-term. These forward-looking statements should be considered in light of the information included in this Form 10-K, including, in particular,  the factors discussed below.Risk Factors
Our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, those set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results.Industry and economic conditions may adversely affect the market and operating conditions of our customers, which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations.The operating results of our segments are impacted by general global industry and economic conditions that can cause changes in spending and capital investment patterns, demand for our products and services and the level of our manufacturing and shipping costs. The operating results of our Aerospace  segment, which generated 35 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2009, are directly tied to cyclical industry and economic conditions, including global demand for air travel as reflected in new aircraft production, the deferral or cancellation of orders for new aircraft, delays in launch schedules for new aircraft  platforms, the retirement of aircraft, global flying hours, and business and general aviation aircraft utilization rates, as well as changes in customer buying patterns with respect to aftermarket parts, supplier consolidation, factory transitions, capacity constraints, and the level and mix of U.S. Government  appropriations for defense and space programs (as further discussed in other risk factors below). The challenging operating environment faced by the commercial airline industry is expected to continue and may be influenced by a wide variety of factors including global flying hours, aircraft fuel prices, labor  issues, airline consolidation, airline insolvencies, terrorism and safety concerns as well as changes in regulations. Future terrorist actions or pandemic health issues could dramatically reduce both the demand for air travel and our Aerospace aftermarket sales and margins. The operating results of our Automation  and Control Solutions (ACS) segment, which generated 41 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2009, are impacted by the level of global residential and commercial construction (including retrofits and upgrades), capital spending and operating expenditures on building and process automation, industrial plant  capacity utilization and expansion, inventory levels in distribution channels, and global economic growth rates. Specialty Materials operating results, which generated 13 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2009, are impacted by global economic growth rates, capacity utilization for chemical, industrial,  refining, petrochemical and semiconductor plants, our customers availability of capital for refinery construction and expansion, and commodity demand volatility. Transportation Systems operating results, which generated 11 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2009, are impacted by global production and  demand for automobiles and11trucks equipped with turbochargers, and regulatory changes regarding automobile and truck emissions and fuel economy, delays in launch schedules for new automotive platforms, and consumer demand and spending for automotive aftermarket and car care products. The challenging operating environment  faced by global automotive and truck manufacturers is expected to continue and may be influenced by a wide variety of factors, including access to and terms of government assistance, ability to reduce high inventory levels, ability to reduce operating costs, and the ability of consumers to obtain financing for new  vehicle purchases. Each of the segments is impacted by volatility in raw material prices (as further described below) and non-material inflation.Raw material price fluctuations and the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements can increase the cost of our products and services and impact our ability to meet commitments to customers.The cost of raw materials is a key element in the cost of our products, particularly in our Specialty Materials (benzene (the key component in phenol), natural gas, ethylene, fluorspar and sulfur), Transportation Systems (nickel, steel, other metals and ethylene glycol) and Aerospace (nickel, titanium and other  metals) segments. Our inability to offset material price inflation through increased prices to customers, formula or long-term fixed price contracts with suppliers, productivity actions or through commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations.Our    manufacturing operations are also highly dependent upon the delivery of materials    (including raw materials) by outside suppliers and their assembly of major    components and subsystems used in our products in a timely manner and in    full compliance with purchase order terms and conditions, quality standards,    and applicable laws and regulations. In addition, many major components and    product equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a single-source    basis; in limited circumstances these suppliers are the sole source of the    component or equipment. Our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery    requirements may be constrained by our suppliers ability to adjust    delivery of long-lead time products during times of volatile demand. Our    suppliers may fail to perform according to specifications as and when required    and we may be unable to identify alternate suppliers or to otherwise mitigate    the consequences of their non-performance. The supply chains for our businesses    could also be disrupted by external events such as natural disasters, extreme    weather events, pandemic health issues, terrorist actions, labor disputes,    governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes (e.g., product    certification or stewardship requirements, sourcing restrictions, climate    change or greenhouse gas emission standards, etc.). Our inability to fill    our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under    commercial and government contracts, which could, in turn, result in reduced    sales and profits, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer    relationships. Transitions to new suppliers may result in significant costs    and delays, including those related to the required recertification of parts    obtained from new suppliers with our customers and/or regulatory agencies.    In addition, because our businesses cannot always immediately adapt their    cost structure to changing market conditions, our manufacturing capacity    for certain products may at times exceed or fall short of our production    requirements, which could adversely impact our operating costs, profitability    and customer and supplier relationships.Our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins.Our businesses operate in global markets that are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and evolving industry standards. Accordingly, our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to (i) identify emerging technological trends in our target end-markets, (ii) develop and  maintain competitive products, (iii) enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization of our products, (iv) develop, manufacture and bring products to market quickly and cost-effectively, and (v) develop and retain  individuals with the requisite expertise.Our ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect our competitive position and requires the investment of significant resources. These development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses, and they may not lead to the 12development of newtechnologies or products on a timely basis or that meet the needs of our customersas fully as competitive offerings. In addition, the markets for our productsmay not develop or grow as we currently anticipate. The failure of our technologiesor products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by ourcompetitors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect ourcompetitive standing and prospects.Protecting our intellectual property is critical to our innovation efforts.We own or are licensed under a large number of U.S. and non-U.S. patents and patent applications, trademarks and copyrights. Our intellectual property rights may expire or be challenged, invalidated or infringed upon by third parties or we may be unable to maintain, renew or enter into new licenses of third  party proprietary intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms. In some non-U.S. countries, laws affecting intellectual property are uncertain in their application, which can affect the scope or enforceability of our patents and other intellectual property rights. Any of these events or factors could diminish  or cause us to lose the competitive advantages associated with our intellectual property, subject us to judgments, penalties and significant litigation costs, and/or temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or services.An increasing percentage of our sales and operations is in non-U.S. jurisdictions and is subject to the economic, political, regulatory and other risks of international operations.Our international operations, including U.S. exports, comprise a growing proportion of our operating results. Our strategy calls for increasing sales to and operations in overseas markets, including developing markets such as Mexico, China, India, the Middle East and Eastern Europe. In 2009, 51 percent of  our total sales (including products manufactured in the U.S. and in international locations) were outside of the U.S. including 28 percent in Europe and 11 percent in Asia. Risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations, wage and price controls, employment regulations, foreign  investment laws, import, export and other trade restrictions (such as embargoes and trade restrictions), changes in regulations regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises, nationalization of private enterprises, government instability, and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the  safety of our employees in these regions. The cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide can also impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain  acceptable operating margins.As we continue to grow our businesses internationally, our operating results could be increasingly affected by the relative strength of the European and Asian economies and the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. We do have a policy to reduce the risk of volatility through hedging activities, but such  activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us and may not be successful in eliminating such volatility.We may be required to recognize impairment charges for our long-lived assets or available for sale investments.At December 31, 2009, the net carrying value of long-lived assets (property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets) and available for sale securities totaled approximately $17.5 billion and $0.1 billion, respectively. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we  periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in impairments to goodwill and other  long-lived assets. An other than temporary decline in the market value of our available for sale securities may also result in an impairment charge. Future impairment charges could significantly affect our results of operations in the periods recognized. Impairment charges would also reduce our consolidated  shareowners equity and increase our debt-to-total-capitalization ratio, which could negatively impact our credit rating and access to the public debt and equity markets.13A change in the level of U.S. Government defense and space funding or the mix of programs to which such funding is allocated could adversely impact sales of Aerospaces defense and space-related product and services.Sales of our defense and space-related products and services are largely dependent upon government budgets, particularly the U.S. defense budget. Sales as a prime contractor and subcontractor to the U.S. Department of Defense comprised approximately 32 and 11 percent of Aerospace and total sales,  respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2009. Although U.S. defense spending increased in 2009 and is expected to increase again in 2010, we cannot predict the extent to which total funding and/or funding for individual programs will be included, increased or reduced as part of the 2011 and subsequent  budgets ultimately approved by Congress, or be included in the scope of separate supplemental appropriations. We also cannot predict the impact of potential changes in priorities due to military transformation and planning and/or the nature of war-related activity on existing, follow-on or replacement programs. A  shift in defense or space spending to programs in which we do not participate and/or reductions in funding for or termination of existing programs could adversely impact our results of operations.As a supplier of military and other equipment to the U.S. Government, we are subject to unusual risks, such as the right of the U.S. Government to terminate contracts for convenience and to conduct audits and investigations of our operations and performance.In addition to normal business risks, companies like Honeywell that supply military and other equipment to the U.S. Government are subject to unusual risks, including dependence on Congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of funds, changes in governmental procurement legislation and  regulations and other policies that reflect military and political developments, significant changes in contract scheduling, complexity of designs and the rapidity with which they become obsolete, necessity for constant design improvements, intense competition for U.S. Government business necessitating increases  in time and investment for design and development, difficulty of forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on developmental and highly sophisticated technical work, and other factors characteristic of the industry, such as contract award protests and delays in the timing of contract approvals. Changes are  customary over the life of U.S. Government contracts, particularly development contracts, and generally result in adjustments of contract prices.Our contracts with the U.S. Government are subject to audits. Like many other government contractors, we have received audit reports that recommend downward price adjustments to certain contracts or changes to certain accounting systems or controls to comply with various government regulations. We  have made adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in appropriate cases and may do so in the future.U.S. Government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform under the applicable contract. In the case of a termination for convenience, we are typically entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred, plus  termination costs and a reasonable profit. If a contract is terminated by the government for our failure to perform we could be liable for additional costs incurred by the government in acquiring undelivered goods or services from any other source and any other damages suffered by the government.We are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations. If Honeywell or one of its businesses were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations (including violations of certain  environmental or export laws), it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts, suspended from contract performance pending the completion of legal proceedings and/or have its export privileges suspended. The U.S. Government also reserves the right to debar a  contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent, criminal or other egregious misconduct. Debarment generally does not exceed three years.14Our reputation and ability to do business may be impacted by the improper conduct of employees, agents or business partners.We cannot ensure that our extensive compliance controls, policies and procedures will in all instances protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, agents or business partners that would violate the laws of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including laws governing  payments to government officials, competition and data privacy. Any improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could adversely impact our ability to conduct business, results of operations and reputation.Changes in legislation or government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations.The sales and margins of each of our segments are directly impacted by government regulations. Safety and performance regulations (including mandates of the Federal Aviation Administration and other similar international regulatory bodies requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft), product  certification requirements and government procurement practices can impact Aerospace sales, research and development expenditures, operating costs and profitability. The demand for and cost of providing Automation and Control Solutions products, services and solutions can be impacted by fire, security,  safety, health care, environmental and energy efficiency standards and regulations. Specialty Materials results of operations can be affected by environmental (e.g. government regulation of fluorocarbons), safety and energy efficiency standards and regulations, while emissions and energy efficiency standards  and regulations can impact the demand for turbochargers in our Transportation Systems segment. Legislation or regulations regarding areas such as labor and employment, employee benefit plans, tax, health and safety matters, import, export and trade, intellectual property, product certification, product liability  and environmental remediation may impact the results of each of our operating segments and our consolidated results.Completed acquisitions may not perform as anticipated or be integrated as planned, and divestitures may not occur as planned.We regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest non-core businesses. We may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis or at all. In addition, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by (i)  the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns, (ii) the discovery of unanticipated issues or liabilities, (iii) the failure to integrate acquired businesses into Honeywell on schedule and/or to achieve synergies in the planned amount or within the expected timeframe, (iv) the inability to dispose  of non-core assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions and within the expected timeframe, and (v) the degree of protection provided by indemnities from sellers of acquired companies and the obligations under indemnities provided to purchasers of our divested businesses.We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters, government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties.We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and  divestitures, employment, employee benefits plans, intellectual property, import and export matters and environmental, health and safety matters. Resolution of these matters can be prolonged and costly, and the ultimate results or judgments are uncertain due to the inherent uncertainty in litigation and other  proceedings. Moreover, our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements, or become subject to damage awards or settlements, that could have  a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities. It also is15not possible to obtain insurance to protect against all our operational risks and liabilities. The incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and financial condition.Our operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities.Mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to claims of personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures. We  have incurred remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental  matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations can impose substantial fines and  criminal sanctions for violations, and require installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. We incur, and expect to continue to incur capital and operating costs to comply with these laws and regulations. In  addition, changes in laws, regulations and enforcement of policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur costs in the future that would have a  negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations.Our expenses include significant costs related to employee and retiree health benefits.With approximately 122,000 employees, including approximately 54,000 in the U.S., our expenses relating to employee health and retiree health benefits are significant. In recent years, we have experienced significant increases in certain of these costs, largely as a result of economic factors beyond our  control, in particular, ongoing increases in health care costs well in excess of the rate of inflation. Continued increasing health-care costs, legislative or regulatory changes, and volatility in discount rates, as well as changes in other assumptions used to calculate retiree health benefit expenses, may adversely  affect our financial position and results of operations.Risks related to our defined benefit pension plans may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow.Significant changes in actual investment return on pension assets, discount rates, and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and pension contributions in future periods. U.S. generally accepted accounting principles require that we calculate income or expense for the plans using  actuarial valuations. These valuations reflect assumptions about financial markets and interest rates, which may change based on economic conditions. Funding requirements for our U.S. pension plans may become more significant. However, the ultimate amounts to be contributed are dependent upon, among  other things, interest rates, underlying asset returns and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations. For a discussion regarding the significant assumptions used to estimate pension expense, including discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan  assets, and how our financial statements can be affected by pension plan accounting policies, see Critical Accounting Policies included in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.Additional tax expense or additional tax exposures could affect our future profitability.We are subject to income taxes in both the United States and various non-U.S. jurisdictions, and our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions. In 2009, our tax expense represented 26.5 percent of our income before16tax, and includes estimates of additional tax which may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various estimates and assumptions, including assessments of future earnings of the Company that could effect the valuation of our deferred tax assets. Our future results could be adversely affected by changes in  the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the overall profitability of the Company, changes in tax legislation, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax  returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures.Volatility of credit markets or macro-economic factors could adversely affect our business.Changes in U.S. and global financial and equity markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity, and interest rate volatility, may increase the cost of financing as well as the risks of refinancing maturing debt. In addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term ratings assigned by  independent rating agencies. A decrease in these ratings could increase our cost of borrowing.Delays in our customers ability to obtain financing, or the unavailability of financing to our customers, could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow. The inability of our suppliers to obtain financing could result in the need to transition to alternate suppliers, which could result in significant  incremental cost and delay, as discussed above. Lastly, disruptions in the U.S. and global financial markets could impact the financial institutions with which we do business"

These forward-looking statements should be considered in light of the information included in this Form 10-K, including, in particular,  the factors discussed below.Risk Factors
Our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, those set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results.Industry and economic conditions may adversely affect the market and operating conditions of our customers, which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations.The operating results of our segments are impacted by general global industry and economic conditions that can cause changes in spending and capital investment patterns, demand for our products and services and the level of our manufacturing and shipping costs. The operating results of our Aerospace  segment, which generated 35 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2008, are directly tied to cyclical industry and economic conditions, including global demand for air travel as reflected in new aircraft production, the deferral or cancellation of orders for new aircraft, delays in launch schedules for new aircraft  platforms, the retirement of older aircraft, global flying hours, and business and general aviation aircraft utilization rates, as well as changes in customer buying patterns with respect to aftermarket parts, supplier consolidation, factory transitions, capacity constraints, and the level and mix of U.S. Government  appropriations for defense and space programs (as further discussed in other risk factors below). The challenging operating environment faced by the commercial airline industry is expected to continue and may be influenced by a wide variety of factors including declining global flying hours, aircraft fuel prices,  labor issues, airline consolidation, airline insolvencies, terrorism and safety concerns as well as changes in regulations. Future terrorist actions or pandemic health issues could dramatically reduce both the demand for air travel and our Aerospace aftermarket sales and margins. The operating results of our  Automation and Control Solutions (ACS) segment, which generated 38 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2008, are impacted by the level of global residential and commercial construction (including retrofits and upgrades), capital spending and operating expenditures on building and process automation,  industrial plant capacity utilization and expansion, and global economic growth rates. Specialty Materials operating results, which generated 14 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2008, are impacted by global economic growth rates, capacity utilization for chemical, industrial, refining, petrochemical and  semiconductor plants, and commodity demand volatility. Transportation Systems operating results, which generated 13 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2008, are impacted by global production and demand for automobiles and trucks equipped with turbochargers, regulatory changes regarding automobile  and truck emissions11and fuel economy, delays in launch schedules for new automotive platforms, and consumer demand and spending for automotive aftermarket and car care products. The challenging operating environment faced by global automotive and truck manufacturers is expected to continue and may be influenced by a  wide variety of factors, including access to and terms of government assistance, ability to reduce record high inventory levels, ability to reduce operating costs, and the ability of consumers to obtain financing for new vehicle purchases. Each of the segments is impacted by volatility in raw material prices (as  further described below) and non-material inflation.Raw material price fluctuations and the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements can increase the cost of our products and services and impact our ability to meet commitments to customers.The cost of raw materials is a key element in the cost of our products, particularly in our Specialty Materials (benzene (the key component in phenol), natural gas, ethylene, fluorspar and sulfur), Transportation Systems (nickel, steel, other metals and ethylene glycol) and Aerospace (nickel, titanium and other  metals) segments. Our inability to offset material price inflation through increased prices to customers, formula or long-term fixed price contracts with suppliers, productivity actions or through commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations.Our manufacturing operations are also highly dependent upon the delivery of materials (including raw materials) by outside suppliers and their assembly of major components and subsystems used in our products in a timely manner and in full compliance with purchase order terms and conditions, quality  standards, and applicable laws and regulations. In addition, many major components and product equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a single-source basis; in limited circumstances these suppliers are the sole source of the component or equipment. Our ability to manage inventory and meet  delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers ability to adjust delivery of long-lead time products during times of volatile demand. Our suppliers may fail to perform according to specifications as and when required and we may be unable to identify alternate suppliers or to otherwise mitigate the  consequences of their non-performance. The supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by external events such as natural disasters, extreme weather events, pandemic health issues, terrorist actions, labor disputes or governmental actions. Our inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our  ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts, which could, in turn, result in reduced sales and profits, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships. Transitions to new suppliers may result in significant costs and delays, including those related to the required  recertification of parts obtained from new suppliers with our customers and/or regulatory agencies. In addition, because our businesses cannot always immediately adapt their cost structure to changing market conditions, our manufacturing capacity for certain products may at times exceed or fall short of our  production requirements, which could adversely impact our operating costs, profitability and customer and supplier relationships.Our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins.Our businesses operate in global markets that are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and evolving industry standards. Accordingly, our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to (i) identify emerging technological trends in our target end-markets, (ii) develop and  maintain competitive products, (iii) enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization of our products, (iv) develop, manufacture and bring products to market quickly and cost-effectively, and (v) develop and retain  individuals with the requisite expertise.Our ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect our competitive position and requires the investment of significant resources. These development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses, and they may not lead to the development of new  technologies or products on a timely basis or that meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings. In addition, the markets for our products may not develop12or grow as we currently anticipate. The failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects.Protecting our intellectual property is critical to our innovation efforts. We own or are licensed under a large number of U.S. and non-U.S. patents and patent applications, trademarks and copyrights. Our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated or infringed upon by third parties or we may be  unable to maintain, renew or enter into new licenses of third party proprietary intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms. In some non-U.S. countries, laws affecting intellectual property are uncertain in their application, which can affect the scope or enforceability of our patents and other intellectual  property rights. Any of these events or factors could diminish or cause us to lose the competitive advantages associated with our intellectual property, subject us to judgments, penalties and significant litigation costs, and/or temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or  services.An increasing percentage of our sales and operations is in non-U.S. jurisdictions and is subject to the economic, political, regulatory and other risks of international operations.Our international operations, including U.S. exports, comprise a growing proportion of our operating results. Our strategy calls for increasing sales to and operations in overseas markets, including developing markets such as Mexico, China, India and the Middle East. In 2008, 49 percent of our total sales  (including products manufactured in the U.S. and in international locations) were outside of the U.S. including 29 percent in Europe and 10 percent in Asia. Risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations, wage and price controls, employment regulations, foreign investment laws,  import, export and other trade restrictions (such as embargoes and trade restrictions), changes in regulations regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises, nationalization of private enterprises, government instability, our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff in these regions and maintaining the safety  of our employees. The cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide can also impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating  margins.As we continue to grow our businesses internationally, our operating results could be increasingly affected by the relative strength of the European and Asian economies and the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. We do have a policy to reduce the risk of volatility through hedging activities, but such  activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us and may not be successful in eliminating such volatility.We may be required to recognize impairment charges for our long-lived assets or available for sale investments.At December 31, 2008, the net carrying value of long-lived assets (property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets) and available for sale securities totaled approximately $17.4 billion and $0.1 billion, respectively. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we  periodically assess these assets to determine if they are impaired. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in impairments to goodwill and other  long-lived assets. An other than temporary decline in the market value of our available for sale securities may also result in an impairment charge. Future impairment charges could significantly affect our results of operations in the periods recognized. Impairment charges would also reduce our consolidated  shareowners equity and increase our debt-to-total-capitalization ratio, which could negatively impact our credit rating and access to the public debt and equity markets.13A change in the level of U.S. Government defense and space funding or the mix of programs to which such funding is allocated could adversely impact sales of Aerospaces defense and space-related product and services.Sales of our defense and space-related products and services are largely dependent upon government budgets, particularly the U.S. defense budget. Sales as a prime contractor and subcontractor to the U.S. Department of Defense comprised approximately 27 and 9 percent of Aerospace and total sales,  respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2008. Although U.S. defense spending increased in 2008 and is expected to increase again in 2009, we cannot predict the extent to which total funding and/or funding for individual programs will be included, increased or reduced as part of the 2010 and subsequent  budgets ultimately approved by Congress, or be included in the scope of separate supplemental appropriations. We also cannot predict the impact of potential changes in priorities due to military transformation and planning and/or the nature of war-related activity on existing, follow-on or replacement programs. A  shift in defense or space spending to programs in which we do not participate and/or reductions in funding for or termination of existing programs could adversely impact our results of operations.As a supplier of military and other equipment to the U.S. Government, we are subject to unusual risks, such as the right of the U.S. Government to terminate contracts for convenience and to conduct audits and investigations of our operations and performance.In addition to normal business risks, companies like Honeywell that supply military and other equipment to the U.S. Government are subject to unusual risks, including dependence on Congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of funds, changes in governmental procurement legislation and  regulations and other policies that reflect military and political developments, significant changes in contract scheduling, complexity of designs and the rapidity with which they become obsolete, necessity for constant design improvements, intense competition for U.S. Government business necessitating increases  in time and investment for design and development, difficulty of forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on developmental and highly sophisticated technical work, and other factors characteristic of the industry, such as contract award protests and delays in the timing of contract approvals. Changes are  customary over the life of U.S. Government contracts, particularly development contracts, and generally result in adjustments of contract prices.Our contracts with the U.S. Government are subject to audits. Like many other government contractors, we have received audit reports that recommend downward price adjustments to certain contracts to comply with various government regulations. We have made adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in  appropriate cases and may do so in the future.U.S. Government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform under the applicable contract. In the case of a termination for convenience, we are typically entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred, plus  termination costs and a reasonable profit. If a contract is terminated by the government for our failure to perform we could be liable for additional costs incurred by the government in acquiring undelivered goods or services from any other source and any other damages suffered by the government.We are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations. If Honeywell or one of its businesses were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations (including violations of certain  environmental or export laws), it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts, suspended from contract performance pending the completion of legal proceedings and/or have its export privileges suspended. The U.S. Government also reserves the right to debar a  contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent, criminal or other egregious misconduct. Debarment generally does not exceed three years.14Our reputation and ability to do business may be impacted by the improper conduct of employees, agents or business partners.We cannot ensure that our extensive compliance controls, policies and procedures will in all instances protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees, agents or business partners that would violate the laws of the jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including laws governing  payments to government officials, competition and data privacy. Any improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations, monetary and non-monetary penalties and could adversely impact our ability to conduct business, results of operations and reputation.Changes in legislation or government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations.The sales and margins of each of our segments are directly impacted by government regulations. Safety and performance regulations (including mandates of the Federal Aviation Administration and other similar international regulatory bodies requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft), product  certification requirements and government procurement practices can impact Aerospace sales, research and development expenditures, operating costs and profitability. The demand for and cost of providing Automation and Control Solutions products, services and solutions can be impacted by fire, security,  safety, health care, environmental and energy efficiency standards and regulations. Specialty Materials results of operations can be affected by environmental (e.g. government regulation of fluorocarbons), safety and energy efficiency standards and regulations, while emissions and energy efficiency standards  and regulations can impact the demand for turbochargers in our Transportation Systems segment. Legislation or regulations regarding areas such as labor and employment, employee benefit plans, tax, health and safety matters, import, export and trade, intellectual property, product certification, product liability  and environmental remediation may impact the results of each of our operating segments and our consolidated results.Completed acquisitions may not perform as anticipated or be integrated as planned, and divestitures may not occur as planned.We regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest non-core businesses. We may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis or at all. In addition, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by (i)  the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns, (ii) the discovery of unanticipated issues or liabilities, (iii) the failure to integrate acquired businesses into Honeywell on schedule and/or to achieve synergies in the planned amount or within the expected timeframe, (iv) the inability to dispose  of non-core assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions and within the expected timeframe, and (v) the degree of protection provided by indemnities from sellers of acquired companies and the obligations under indemnities provided to purchasers of our divested businesses.We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters, government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties.We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and  divestitures, employment, employee benefits plans, intellectual property, import and export matters and environmental, health and safety matters. Resolution of these matters can be prolonged and costly, and the ultimate results or judgments are uncertain due to the inherent uncertainty in litigation and other  proceedings. Moreover, our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements, or become subject to damage awards or settlements, that could have  a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities. It also is not possible to obtain insurance to protect  against all our operational risks and liabilities. The15incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and financial condition.Our operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities.Mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to claims of personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures. We  have incurred remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental  matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations can impose substantial fines and  criminal sanctions for violations, and require installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. We incur, and expect to continue to incur capital and operating costs to comply with these laws and regulations. In  addition, changes in laws, regulations and enforcement of policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur costs in the future that would have a  negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations.Our expenses include significant costs related to employee health and retiree health and pension benefits.With approximately 128,000 employees, including approximately 58,000 in the U.S., our expenses relating to employee health and retiree health and pension benefits are significant. In recent years, we have experienced significant increases in certain of these costs, largely as a result of economic factors  beyond our control, in particular, ongoing increases in health care costs well in excess of the rate of inflation. Continued increasing health-care costs, volatility in investment returns and discount rates, as well as changes in other assumptions used to calculate retiree health and pension benefit expenses, may  adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or require significant contributions to our pension plans.Additional tax expense or additional tax exposures could affect our future profitabilityWe are subject to income taxes in both the United States and various non-U.S. jurisdictions, and our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution of income among these different jurisdictions. In 2008, our tax expense represented 26.5 percent of our income before tax, and  includes estimates of additional tax which may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various estimates and assumptions, including assessments of future earnings of the Company that could effect the valuation of our deferred tax assets. Our future results could be adversely affected by changes in the  effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the overall profitability of the Company, changes in tax legislation, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax  returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures.Volatility of credit markets or macro-economic factors could adversely affect our businessChanges in U.S. and global financial and equity markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity, and interest rate volatility, may increase the cost of financing as well as the risks of refinancing maturing debt. In addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term ratings assigned by  independent rating agencies. A decrease in these ratings could increase our cost of borrowing.16The current tightening of credit could also adversely affect our customers ability to obtain financing, primarily in our long cycle businesses and airline industry operations. Delays in our customers ability to obtain financing, or the unavailability of financing could adversely affect our results of operations. The  inability of our suppliers to obtain financing could result in the need to transition to alternate suppliers, which could result in significant incremental cost and delay, as discussed above. Lastly, the disruptions in the U.S. and global financial markets could impact the financial institutions with which we do business"

Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking StatementsWe have described many of the trends and other factors that drive our business and future results in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of  Operations, including the overview of the Company and each of our segments and the discussion of their respective economic and other factors and areas of focus for 2008. These sections and other  parts of this report (including this Item 1A) contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.Forward-looking statements are those that address activities, events or developments that management intends, expects, projects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future. They are  based on managements assumptions and assessments in light of past experience and trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other relevant factors. They are not guarantees of  future performance, and actual results, developments and business decisions may differ significantly from those envisaged by our forward-looking statements. We do not undertake to update or revise any  of our forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that can affect our performance in both the near-and long-term. These forward-looking  statements should be considered in light of the information included in this Form 10-K, including, in particular, the factors discussed below.Risk Factors
Our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, those set forth below, any one of which could cause our  actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results.Industry and economic conditions may adversely affect the market and operating conditions of our customers, which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our  results of operations.The operating results of our segments are impacted by general industry and economic conditions that can cause changes in spending and capital investment patterns, demand for our products and  services and the level of our manufacturing costs. The operating results of our Aerospace segment, which generated 35 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2007, are directly tied to cyclical industry  and economic conditions, including global demand for air travel as reflected in new aircraft production and/or the retirement of older aircraft, global flying hours, and business and general aviation aircraft  utilization rates, as well as supplier consolidation, factory transitions and capacity constraints, and the level and mix of U.S. Government appropriations for defense and space programs (as further  discussed in other risk factors below). The challenging operating environment faced by the commercial airline industry is expected to continue and may be influenced by a wide variety of factors including  aircraft fuel prices, labor issues, airline consolidation, airline insolvencies, terrorism and safety concerns as well as changes in regulations. Future terrorist actions or pandemic health issues could  dramatically reduce both the demand for air travel and our Aerospace aftermarket sales and margins. The operating results of our Automation and Control Solutions (ACS) segment, which generated 36  percent of our consolidated revenues in 2007, are impacted by the level of global residential and commercial construction (including retrofits and upgrades), capital spending on building and process  automation, industrial plant capacity utilization and expansion, and global economic growth rates. Specialty Materials operating results, which generated 14 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2007,  are impacted by global economic growth rates, and capacity utilization for chemical, industrial, refining and petrochemical plants. Transportation Systems operating results, which generated 15 percent of  our consolidated revenues in 2007, are impacted by global production and demand for automobiles and trucks equipped with turbochargers, regulatory changes regarding automobile and truck emissions  and fuel economy, and consumer spending levels and patterns for automotive aftermarket and car care products. Each of the segments is impacted by volatility in raw material prices (as further described  below) and non-material inflation.10Raw material price fluctuations and the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements can increase the cost of our products and services and impact our ability to  meet commitments to customers.The cost of raw materials is a key element in the cost of our products, particularly in our Specialty Materials (benzene (the key component in phenol), natural gas, ethylene and sulfur), Transportation  Systems (nickel, steel, other metals and ethylene glycol) and Aerospace (nickel, titanium and other metals) segments. Our inability to offset material price inflation through increased prices to customers,  formula or long-term fixed price contracts with suppliers, productivity actions or through commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations.Our manufacturing operations are also highly dependent upon the delivery of materials (including raw materials) by outside suppliers and their assembly of major components and subsystems used in  our products in a timely manner and in full compliance with purchase order terms and conditions, quality standards, and applicable laws and regulations. We also depend in limited instances on sole  source suppliers. Our suppliers may fail to perform according to specifications as and when required and we may be unable to identify alternate suppliers or to otherwise mitigate the consequences of their  non-performance. The supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by external events such as natural disasters, pandemic health issues, terrorist actions, labor disputes or governmental  actions. Our inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts, which could, in turn, result in reduced sales and profits, contract  penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships.Our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins.Our businesses operate in global markets that are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and evolving industry standards. Accordingly, our future growth rate depends upon a number of  factors, including our ability to (i) identify emerging technological trends in our target end-markets, (ii) develop and maintain competitive products, (iii) enhance our products by adding innovative features  that differentiate our products from those of our competitors, (iv) develop, manufacture and bring products to market quickly and cost-effectively, and (v) develop and retain individuals with the requisite  expertise.Our ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect our competitive position and requires the investment of significant resources. These development efforts divert  resources from other potential investments in our businesses, and they may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or that meet the needs of our customers as fully  as competitive offerings. In addition, the markets for our products may not develop or grow as we currently anticipate. The failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more  attractive offerings by our competitors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects.Protecting our intellectual property is critical to our innovation efforts. We own or are licensed under a large number of U.S. and non-U.S. patents and patent applications, trademarks and copyrights.  Our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated or infringed upon by third parties or we may be unable to maintain, renew or enter into new licenses of third party proprietary intellectual  property on commercially reasonable terms. In some non-U.S. countries, laws affecting intellectual property are uncertain in their application, which can affect the scope or enforceability of our patents and  other intellectual property rights. Any of these events or factors could diminish or cause us to lose the competitive advantages associated with our intellectual property, subject us to judgments, penalties  and significant litigation costs, and/or temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or services.11An increasing percentage of our sales and operations is in non-U.S. jurisdictions and is subject to the economic, political, regulatory and other risks of international operations.Our international operations, including U.S. exports, comprise a growing proportion of our operating results and our strategy calls for increasing sales to and operations in overseas markets, including  developing markets such as China, India and the Middle East. In 2007, 49 percent of our total sales (including products manufactured in the U.S. and in international locations) were outside of the U.S.  including 29 percent in Europe and 11 percent in Asia. Risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations, wage and price controls, employment regulations, foreign investment  laws, import and trade restrictions (including embargoes), changes in regulations regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises, nationalization of private enterprises, government instability and our  ability to hire and maintain qualified staff in these regions. The cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide can also impair our flexibility in modifying product,  marketing, pricing or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins.As we continue to grow our businesses internationally, our operating results could be increasingly effected by the relative strength of the European and Asian economies and the impact of exchange  rate fluctuations. We do have a policy to reduce the risk of volatility through hedging activities, but such activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us and may not be successful in  eliminating such volatility.We may be required to recognize impairment charges for our long-lived assets.At December 31, 2007, the net carrying value of long-lived assets (property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets) totaled approximately $15.7 billion. In accordance with generally  accepted accounting principles, we periodically assess our long-lived assets to determine if they are impaired. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, unexpected  significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in impairments to goodwill and other long-lived assets. Future impairment charges  could significantly affect our results of operations in the periods recognized. Impairment charges would also reduce our consolidated shareowners equity and increase our debt-to-total-capitalization ratio,  which could negatively impact our access to the public debt and equity markets.A change in the level of U.S. Government defense and space funding or the mix of programs to which such funding is allocated could adversely impact sales of Aerospaces defense  and space-related product and services.Sales of our defense and space-related products and services are largely dependent upon government budgets, particularly the U.S. defense budget. Sales as a prime contractor and subcontractor to  the U.S. Department of Defense comprised approximately 26 and 9 percent of Aerospace and total sales, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2007. Although U.S. defense spending increased  in 2007 and is expected to increase again in 2008, we cannot predict the extent to which funding for individual programs will be included, increased or reduced as part of the 2009 and subsequent budgets  ultimately approved by Congress, or be included in the scope of separate supplemental appropriations. We also cannot predict the impact of potential changes in priorities due to military transformation  and planning and/or the nature of war-related activity on existing, follow-on or replacement programs. A shift in defense or space spending to programs in which we do not participate and/or reductions in  funding for or termination of existing programs could adversely impact our results of operations.As a supplier of military and other equipment to the U.S. Government, we are subject to unusual risks, such as the right of the U.S. Government to terminate contracts for  convenience and to conduct audits and investigations of our operations and performance.In addition to normal business risks, companies like Honeywell that supply military and other equipment to the U.S. Government are subject to unusual risks, including dependence on12Congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of funds, changes in governmental procurement legislations and regulations and other policies that reflect military and political developments,  significant changes in contract scheduling, complexity of designs and the rapidity with which they become obsolete, necessity for constant design improvements, intense competition for U.S. Government  business necessitating increases in time and investment for design and development, difficulty of forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on developmental and highly sophisticated technical work,  and other factors characteristic of the industry. Changes are customary over the life of U.S. Government contracts, particularly development contracts, and generally result in adjustments of contract  prices.Our contracts with the U.S. Government are subject to audits. Like many other government contractors, we have received audit reports that recommend downward price adjustments to certain  contracts to comply with various government regulations. We have made adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in appropriate cases and may do so in the future.U.S. Government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform under the applicable contract. In the case of a  termination for convenience, we are typically entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred, plus termination costs and a reasonable profit. If a contract is terminated by the government for our  failure to perform we could be liable for additional costs incurred by the government in acquiring undelivered goods or services from any other source and any other damages suffered by the government.We are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations. If Honeywell or one of its businesses were charged with wrongdoing  as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations (including violations of certain environmental or export laws), it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new  government contracts, suspended from contract performance pending the completion of legal proceedings and/or have its export privileges suspended. The U.S. Government also reserves the right to  debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent, criminal or other egregious misconduct. Debarment generally does not exceed three years.Changes in legislation or government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations.The sales and margins of each of our segments are directly impacted by government regulations. Safety and performance regulations (including mandates of the Federal Aviation Administration and  other similar international regulatory bodies requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft), product certification requirements and government procurement practices can impact Aerospace sales,  research and development expenditures, operating costs and profitability. The demand for and cost of providing Automation and Control Solutions products, services and solutions can be impacted by fire,  security, safety, health care, enviornmental and energy efficiency standards and regulations. Specialty Materials results of operations can be affected by environmental (e.g. government regulation of  fluorocarbons), safety and energy efficiency standards and regulations, while emissions and energy efficiency standards and regulations can impact the demand for turbochargers in our Transportation  Systems segment.Completed acquisitions may not perform as anticipated or be integrated as planned, and divestitures may not occur as planned.We regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest non-core businesses. We may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms, on a  timely basis or at all. In addition, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by (i) the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns, (ii) the discovery of  unanticipated issues or liabilities, (iii) the failure to integrate acquired businesses into Honeywell on schedule and/or to achieve synergies in the planned amount or within the expected timeframe, and/or  (iv) the inability to dispose of non-core assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions and within the expected timeframe.13We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters, government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties.We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to  commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employment, employee benefits plans, intellectual property, import and export  matters and environmental, health and safety matters. Resolution of these matters can be prolonged and costly, and the ultimate results or judgments are uncertain due to the inherent uncertainty in  litigation and other proceedings. Moreover, our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, and  we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements, or become subject to damage awards or settlements, that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and  financial condition. While we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities. It also is not  possible to obtain insurance to protect against all our operational risks and liabilities. The incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our  results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and financial condition.Our operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities.Mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to personal  injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures. We have incurred remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs for site contamination and are a  party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing toxic substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving  environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the  environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment. These laws and regulations can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations, and require installation of costly  equipment or operational changes to limit emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. We incur, and expect to continue to incur capital and operating costs to  comply with these laws and regulations. In addition, changes in laws, regulations and enforcement of policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related  to individual sites, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results  of operations.Our expenses include significant costs related to employee health and retiree health and income benefits.With approximately 122,000 employees, including 57,000 in the U.S., our expenses relating to employee health and retiree health and income benefits are significant. In recent years, we have  experienced significant increases in certain of these costs, largely as a result of economic factors beyond our control, in particular, ongoing increases in health care costs well in excess of the rate of  inflation. Continued increasing health-care costs, and changes in other assumptions used to calculate retiree health and income benefit expenses, may affect our future profitability.Additional tax expense or additional tax exposures could affect our future profitabilityWe are subject to income taxes in both the United States and various non-U.S. jurisdictions, and our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution of income among  these different jurisdictions. In 2007, our tax expense represented 26.4 percent of our income before tax, and includes estimates of additional tax which may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects  various estimates and assumptions, including assessments of future earnings of the Company that14could effect the valuation of our deferred tax assets. Our future results could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with  differing statutory tax rates, changes in the overall profitability of the Company, changes in tax legislation, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and continuing assessments of our  tax exposures.Volatility of credit markets or macro-economic factors may increase our cost of financingChanges in U.S. and global financial and equity markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity and interest rate fluctuations, may increase the cost of financing. In addition, our borrowing costs  can be affected by short and long-term ratings assigned by independent rating agencies. A decrease in these ratings could increase our cost of borrowing"

Cautionary Statement about Forward-Looking Statements      We have described many of the trends and other factors that drive our business and future results in “Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, including the discussion of economic and other factors and areas of focus for 2007 for the Company and/or each of our segments. These sections and other parts of this report (including this Item 1A) contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.      Forward-looking statements are those that address activities, events or developments that management intends, expects, projects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future. They are based on management's assumptions and assessments in light of past experience and trends, current conditions, expected future developments and other relevant factors. They are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results, developments and business decisions may differ significantly from those envisaged by our forward-looking statements. We do not undertake to update or revise any of our forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that can affect our performance in both the near-and long-term. These forward-looking statements should be consideredin light of the information included in this Form 10-K, including, in particular, the factors discussed below.Risk Factors
      Our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, those set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results.Industry and economic conditions may adversely affect the market and operating conditions of our customers, which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations.      The operating results of our segments are impacted by general industry and economic conditions that can cause changes in spending and capital investment patterns, demand for our products and services and the level of our manufacturing costs. The operating results of our Aerospace segment, which generated 35 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2006, are directly tied to cyclical industry and economic conditions, including global demand for air travel as reflected in new aircraft production and/or the retirement of older aircraft, global flying hours, and business and general aviation aircraft utilization rates, as well as the level and mix of U.S. Government appropriations for defense and space programs (as further discussed in other risk factors below). The challenging operating environment faced by thecommercial airline industry is expected to continue and may be influenced by a wide variety of factors including aircraft fuel prices, labor issues, airline consolidation, airline insolvencies, terrorism and safety concerns, and changes in regulations. Future terrorist actions or pandemic health issues could dramatically reduce both the demand for air travel and our Aerospace aftermarket sales and margins. The operating results of our Automation and Control Solutions (ACS) segment, which generated 35 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2006, are impacted by the level of global residential and commercial construction (including retrofits and upgrades), capital spending on building and process automation, industrial plant capacity utilization and expansion, and material price inflation. Specialty Materials' operating results, which generated 15 percent of our consolidated revenues in2006, are impacted by global gross domestic product and capacity utilization for chemical, industrial, refining and petrochemical plants. Transportation Systems' operating results, which generated 15 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2006, are impacted by global production and demand for automobiles and trucks equipped with turbochargers, regulatory changes regarding automobile and truck emissions and consumer spending for automotive aftermarket and car care products.10Raw material price fluctuations and the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements can increase the cost of our products and services and impact our ability to meet commitments to customers.      The cost of raw materials is a key element in the cost of our products, particularly in our Specialty Materials (fluorspar, benzene (the key component in phenol) and natural gas), Transportation Systems (nickel and steel) and Aerospace (nickel, titanium and other metals) segments. Our inability to offset material price inflation through increased prices to customers, long-term fixed price contracts with suppliers, productivity actions or through commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations.      Our manufacturing operations are also highly dependent upon the delivery of materials by outside suppliers and their assembly of major components and subsystems used in our products in a timely manner and in full compliance with purchase order terms and conditions, quality standards, and applicable laws and regulations. We also depend in limited instances on sole source suppliers. Our suppliers may fail to perform according to specifications as and when required and we may be unable to identify alternate suppliers or to otherwise mitigate the consequences of their non-performance. The supply chains for our businesses could also be disrupted by external events such as natural disasters, pandemic health issues, terrorist actions, labor disputes or governmental actions. Our inability to fill our supply needs wouldjeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts, which could, in turn, result in reduced sales and profits, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships.Our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies that achieve market acceptance with acceptable margins.      Our businesses operate in global markets that are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and evolving industry standards. Accordingly, our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to (i) identify emerging technological trends in our target end-markets, (ii) develop and maintain competitive products, (iii) enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors, and (iv) develop, manufacture and bring products to market quickly and cost-effectively.      Our ability to develop new products based on technological innovation can affect our competitive position and requires the investment of significant resources. These development efforts divert resources from other potential investments in our businesses, and they may not lead to the development of new technologies or products on a timely basis or that meet the needs of our customers as fully as competitive offerings. In addition, the markets for our products may not develop or grow as we currently anticipate. The failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects.      Protecting our intellectual property is critical to our innovation efforts. We own or are licensed under a large number of U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications, trademarks and copyrights. Our intellectual property rights may be challenged, invalidated or infringed upon by third parties or we may be unable to maintain, renew or enter into new licenses of third party proprietary intellectual property on commercially reasonable terms. In some non-U.S. countries, laws affecting intellectual property are uncertain in their application, which can affect the scope or enforceability of our patents and other intellectual property rights. Any of these events or factors could diminish or cause us to lose the competitive advantages associated with our intellectual property, subject us to judgments, penaltiesand significant litigation costs, and/or temporarily or permanently disrupt our sales and marketing of the affected products or services.An increasing percentage of our sales and operations is in non-U.S. jurisdictions and is subject to the economic, political, regulatory and other risks of international operations.      Our international operations, including U.S. exports, comprise a growing proportion of our operating results and our strategy calls for increasing sales to and operations in overseas markets, including developing markets such as China, India and the Middle East. In 2006, 48 percent of our total sales11(including products manufactured in the U.S. and in international locations) were outside of the U.S. including 28 percent in Europe and 10 percent in Asia. Risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations, wage and price controls, employment regulations, foreign investment laws, import and trade restrictions (including embargoes), changes in regulations regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises, nationalization of private enterprises, government instability and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff in these regions. The cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide can also impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptableoperating margins.As we continue to grow our businesses internationally, our operating results could be effected by the relative strength of the European and Asian economies and the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. We do have a policy to reduce the risk of volatility through hedging activities, but such activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us and may not be successful in eliminating such volatility.We may be required to recognize impairment charges for our long-lived assets.      At December 31, 2006, the net carrying value of long-lived assets (property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets) totaled approximately $14.5 billion. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we periodically assess our long-lived assets to determine if they are impaired. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets, divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in impairments to goodwill and other long-lived assets. Future impairment charges could significantly affect our results of operations in the periods recognized. Impairment charges would also reduce our consolidated shareowners' equity and increase our debt-to-total-capitalization ratio, whichcould negatively impact our access to the public debt and equity markets.A change in the level of U.S. Government defense and space funding or the mix of programs to which such funding is allocated could adversely impact sales of Aerospace's defense and space-related product and services.      Sales of our defense and space-related products and services are largely dependent upon government budgets, particularly the U.S. defense budget. Sales as a prime contractor and subcontractor to the U. S. Department of Defense comprised approximately 27 and 10 percent of Aerospace and total sales, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2006. Although U.S. defense spending increased in 2006 and is expected to increase again in 2007, we cannot predict the extent to which funding for individual programs will be included, increased or reduced as part of the 2008 and subsequent budgets ultimately approved by Congress, or be included in the scope of separate supplemental appropriations. We also cannot predict the impact of potential changes in priorities due to military transformation and planning and/or thenature of war-related activity on existing, follow-on or replacement programs. A shift in defense spending to programs in which we do not participate and/or reductions in funding for or termination of existing programs could adversely impact our results of operations.As a supplier of military and other equipment to the U. S. Government, we are subject to unusual risks, such as the right of the U.S. Government to terminate contracts for convenience and to conduct audits and investigations of our operations and performance.      In addition to normal business risks, companies like Honeywell that supply military and other equipment to the U.S. Government are subject to unusual risks, including dependence on Congressional appropriations and administrative allotment of funds, changes in governmental procurement legislations and regulations and other policies that reflect military and political developments, significant changes in contract scheduling, complexity of designs and the rapidity with which they become obsolete, necessity for constant design improvements, intense competition for U.S. Government business necessitating increases in time and investment for design and development, difficulty of forecasting costs and schedules when bidding on developmental and highly sophisticated technical work, and other factors characteristic ofthe12industry. Changes are customary over the life of U.S. Government contracts, particularly development contracts, and generally result in adjustments of contract prices.Our contracts with the U.S. Government are subject to audits. Like many other government contractors, we have received audit reports that recommend downward price adjustments to certain contracts to comply with various government regulations. We have made adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in appropriate cases and may do so in the future.U.S. Government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform under the applicable contract. In the case of a termination for convenience, we are typically entitled to reimbursement for our allowable costs incurred, plus termination costs and a reasonable profit. If a contract is terminated by the government for our failure to perform we could be liable for additional costs incurred by the government in acquiring undelivered goods or services from any other source and any other damages suffered by the government.We are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations. If Honeywell or one of its businesses were charged with wrongdoing as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations (including violations of certain environmental or export laws), it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts pending the completion of legal proceedings. The U.S. Government also reserves the right to debar a contractor from receiving new government contracts for fraudulent, criminal or other egregious misconduct. Debarment generally does not exceed three years.Changes in legislation or government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations.      The sales and margins of each of our segments are directly impacted by government regulations. Safety and performance regulations (including mandates of the Federal Aviation Administration and other similar international regulatory bodies requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft), product certification requirements and government procurement practices can impact Aerospace sales, research and development expenditures, operating costs and profitability. The demand for and cost of providing Automation and Control Solutions products, services and solutions can be impacted by fire, security, safety, health care and energy efficiency standards and regulations. Specialty Materials' results of operations can be affected by environmental (e.g. government regulation of fluorocarbons), safety and energyefficiency standards and regulations, while emissions and energy efficiency standards and regulations can impact the demand for turbochargers in our Transportation Systems segment.Completed acquisitions may not perform as anticipated or be integrated as planned, and divestitures may not occur as planned.      We  regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions  and seek to divest non-core businesses. We may not be able to complete transactions  on favorable terms, on a timely basis or at all. In addition, our results of  operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by (i) the failure of acquired  businesses to meet or exceed expected returns, (ii) the discovery of unanticipated  issues or liabilities, (iii) the failure to integrate acquired businesses into  Honeywell on schedule and/or to achieve synergies within the plan and timeframe,  and/or (iv) the inability to dispose of non-core assets and businesses on satisfactory  terms and conditions and within the expected time frame.We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters, government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties.      We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employment, employee benefits plans, and environmental, health and safety matters. Resolution of these matters can be prolonged and costly, and the ultimate results or judgments are uncertain due to the inherent uncertainty in litigation and other proceedings. Moreover, our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the13impact of evidentiary requirements, and we may be required to pay damage awards or settlements, or become subject to damage awards or settlements, that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities. It also is not possible to obtain insurance to protect against all our operational risks and liabilities. The incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and financial condition.Our operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities.      Mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures. We have incurred remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing toxic substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to theprotection of the environment. These laws and regulations can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations, and require installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. We incur, and expect to continue to incur capital and operating costs to comply with these laws and regulations. In addition, changes in laws, regulations and enforcement of policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations.Our expenses include significant costs related to employee health and retiree health and income benefits.      With approximately 118,000 employees, including 56,000 in the U.S, our expenses relating to employee health and retiree health and income benefits are significant. In recent years, we have experienced significant increases in certain of these costs, largely as a result of economic factors beyond our control, in particular, ongoing increases in health care costs well in excess of the rate of inflation. Continued increasing health-care costs, and changes in other assumptions used to calculate retiree health and income benefit expenses, may affect our future profitability.Additional tax expense or additional tax exposures could affect our future profitability      We  are subject to income taxes in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions,  and our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the distribution  of income among these different jurisdictions. In 2006, our tax expense represented  25.7 percent of our income before tax, and includes estimates of additional  tax which may be incurred for tax exposures and reflects various estimates and  assumptions, including assessments of future earnings of the Company that could  effect the valuation of our deferred tax assets. Our future results could be  adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change  in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes  in the overall profitability of the Company, changes in tax legislation, changes  in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and continuing assessments  of our tax exposures"

Future terrorist actions or pandemic health issues could dramatically reduce both the demand for air travel and our Aerospace aftermarket sales and margins. The operating results of our Automation and Control Solutions (ACS) segment, which generated 34 percent of our consolidated revenues in 2005, are impacted by the level of global residential and commercial construction (including retrofits and upgrades), capital spending on building and process automation, industrial plant capacity utilization and expansion, and material price inflation. Specialty Materials' operating results are impacted by global gross domestic product and capacity utilization for chemical, industrial,refining and petrochemical plants. Transportation Systems' operating results are impacted by global production and demand for automobiles and trucks equipped with turbochargers, and consumer spending for automotive aftermarket and car care products.

These laws and regulations can13impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations, and require installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases. We incur, and expect to continue to incur capital and operating costs to comply with these laws and regulations. In addition, changes in laws, regulations and enforcement of policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations"
