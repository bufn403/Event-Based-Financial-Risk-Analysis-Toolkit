January 2023, we announced a series of strategic actions, including, among other things, the proposed spinoff of our Kidney Care business into an independent company (the proposed spinoff) and plans to implement a simplified operating model and manufacturing footprint. While we have completed implementation of the new operating model, we may encounter challenges to executing the proposed spinoff on the terms, structure and within the timeframe we have announced, or at all. The proposed spinoff will be subject to the satisfaction of a number of customary conditions, including final approval from Baxter’s Board of Directors. The failure to satisfy any of the required conditions could delay the completion of the proposed spinoff for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring at all. Additionally, the proposed spinoff is complex in nature, and unanticipated developments or changes, including disruptions in general market conditions, changes in law, challenges or complexities in executing the spinoff of the two businesses or developments of viable medical, pharmacological and technological advances (as further discussed in “Other Risks Relating to Our Business If we are unable to successfully introduce or monetize new and existing products or services, or fail to keep pace with changing consumer preferences and needs or advances in technology, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected”) may affect our ability to complete the proposed spinoff on the terms or on the timeline we have announced, or at all. The terms and conditions of the required regulatory authorizations and consents that are granted, if any, may also impose requirements, limitations or costs, or place restrictions on the conduct of the independent companies or impact our ability to complete the proposed spinoff on the terms or timeline we have announced, or at all.Although we intend for the proposed spinoff to be tax-free to Baxter’s stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we have initiated the preparatory restructuring, which has generated, and we expect to continue to generate, non-U.S. tax liabilities and may also generate potential impairments of deferred tax assets. Moreover, there can be no assurance that the proposed spinoff will qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The IRS ruling and tax opinion mentioned above will be based upon various factual representations and assumptions, as well as certain undertakings made by Baxter and the new independent company. If any of these factual representations or assumptions are, or become, untrue or incomplete in any material respect, an undertaking is not complied with, or the facts upon which the opinion or ruling are based are materially different from the actual facts relating to the proposed spinoff, reliance on the opinion or ruling may be jeopardized. If the proposed spinoff were ultimately determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would incur a significant tax liability, while the distributions to Baxter’s stockholders would become taxable and the new company could incur income tax liabilities as well.We are exposed to new risks as a result of the proposed spinoff and other strategic actions we are undertaking. Our strategic actions may not achieve their anticipated benefits, or our costs may exceed our estimates.Our businesses have begun to face, and will continue to face, material challenges in connection with the proposed spinoff and the other strategic actions we are undertaking (including the recent implementation of a simplified operating model and the ongoing simplification of our manufacturing footprint). These challenges include, without limitation, the diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business concerns; appropriately allocating assets and liabilities among the companies to be separated in the proposed spinoff, particularly given the complex nature of the proposed spinoff; attracting, retaining and motivating key management and other employees; retaining existing, or attracting new, business and operational relationships, including with customers, suppliers, employees and other counterparties; maintaining our relationships with regulators; assigning customer contracts and intellectual property to each of the businesses; and potential negative reactions from the financial markets. In particular, in the last few years, we have undertaken other strategic and business transformation actions (including the recent divestiture of our BPS business, the acquisition of Hillrom and cost reduction initiatives) that have entailed changes across our organizational structure, senior leadership, culture, functional alignment, outsourcing and other areas. This poses risks in the form of personnel capacity constraints and institutional knowledge loss that has led to, and could in the future lead to, missed performance or financial targets and harm to our reputation, and these risks are heightened with the additional interdependent actions that will be needed to complete the proposed spinoff and other strategic actions we are currently implementing and pursing or which we may pursue in the future. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant expenses in connection with the proposed spinoff and other strategic actions we are undertaking. These expenses have been significant, and may continue to grow, and may not yield a discernible benefit if the actions are not completed on schedule or at all. In addition, the anticipated 11benefits of these actions are based on a number of assumptions, some of which may prove incorrect, and we cannot predict with certainty when the expected benefits will occur, or the extent to which they will be achieved. As a result, even if the proposed spinoff or other strategic actions are completed, they may not achieve some or all of the anticipated strategic, financial, operational or other benefits in the expected timeframe, or at all, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Further, even if the proposed spinoff is completed, we cannot assure you that each separate company will be successful. Completion of the proposed spinoff will result in independent companies that are smaller, less diversified companies, with more limited businesses concentrated in their respective industries than Baxter. As a result, each company will be more vulnerable to changing market conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, results of operations, financial conditions and cash flows. In addition, the diversification of revenues, costs and cash flows will diminish, such that each company’s results of operations, cash flows, working capital, effective tax rate and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility, and each company’s ability to fund capital expenditures and investments, pay dividends and meet debt obligations and other liabilities may be diminished. Following completion of the proposed spinoff, each company will also incur one-time and ongoing costs, including the costs of operating as independent companies, that the separated businesses will no longer be able to share. In addition, until the market has fully analyzed the values of the separate companies, the price of our common stock and common stock of the new company may experience volatility. Our common stock or the common stock of the new company may not match some holders’ investment strategies or meet minimum criteria for inclusion in stock market indices or portfolios, which could cause certain investors to sell their shares, which could in turn lead to declines in the trading price of such stock. As a result of any of the foregoing or other risks, the combined value of the common stock of the two publicly traded companies may be less than what the value of our common stock would have been absent the proposed spinoff. We may continue to experience difficulties with our integration of Hillrom or fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the Hillrom acquisition.During 2021, we completed the acquisition of Hillrom. The success of this acquisition depends on, among other things, our ability to integrate Hillrom in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities, realizes anticipated cost and revenue synergies and achieves certain previously communicated net leverage targets without adversely affecting current revenues and investments in future growth. If we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the Hillrom acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.There is a significant degree of difficulty and management distraction inherent in the process of integrating an acquisition. The integration of Hillrom into our operations is complex and time-consuming and certain aspects have taken longer than originally anticipated and have required more effort than was originally planned. Challenges associated with our integration efforts are also heightened due to the other strategic actions we are pursuing. This has resulted in, and may continue to result in, additional expenses and other difficulties as we work to complete our ongoing strategic initiatives, including challenges consolidating certain operations and functions (including regulatory and other corporate functions), integrating technologies (including differing information technology systems and processes), organizations, procedures, policies and operations, addressing differences in the business cultures of the two companies, and retaining key personnel, any of which could adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition. The integration process and other disruptions resulting from the Hillrom acquisition and our ongoing strategic initiatives also disrupt our ongoing businesses and could cause inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our relationships with market participants, employees, regulators and others with whom we have business or other dealings. Any failure to successfully or cost-effectively integrate Hillrom could have a material adverse effect on our business and cause reputational harm. If our business strategy and development activities are unsuccessful, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.While we remain committed to deleveraging, we expect to engage in significant business development activities over the longer term (once we have satisfied our net leverage targets), including evaluating acquisitions, joint development opportunities, technology licensing arrangements and other opportunities, such as potential divestitures and targeted market exits as we look to optimize our product portfolio and improve our operating margins. These activities may result in substantial investment of our resources (including resources currently focused on our ongoing strategic initiatives, such as the proposed spinoff). Our success developing products, expanding into new markets and optimizing our market presence from such activities will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to find suitable opportunities or partners for acquisition, investment, alliance or 12divestiture; competition from other companies in the industries in which we operate that are seeking similar opportunities; whether we are able to complete an acquisition, investment, alliance or divestiture on terms that are satisfactory to us or at all; the strength of the underlying technology and products of any of the other parties involved in a transaction, as well as their ability to execute their business strategies; any intellectual property and litigation related to any other party’s products or technology; and our ability to successfully integrate the acquired company, business, product, technology or research into our existing operations (or to divest such company, business, product, technology or research from our existing operations), including the ability to adequately fund acquired in-process R&D projects and to maintain adequate controls over the combined operations. Certain of these activities are subject to antitrust and competition laws, which could impact our ability to pursue strategic transactions and could result in mandated divestitures in the context of proposed acquisitions. Additionally, certain divestitures could result in negative market or regulatory reactions. If we are unsuccessful in our business development activities, we may not realize the intended benefits of such activities, including that acquisition and integration or divestiture costs may be greater than expected or the possibility that the expected return on investment, synergies and accretion will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected timeframes. For more information, see Note 3 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Risks Relating to Our Financial Performance and Our Common StockGlobal economic conditions, including inflation and supply chain disruptions, have adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, our operations.General global economic downturns and macroeconomic trends, including heightened inflation, capital markets volatility, interest rate and currency rate fluctuations, and economic slowdown or recession, have resulted in, and may continue to result in, unfavorable conditions that negatively affect demand for our products and exacerbate other risks described in this “Risk Factors
” section that affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Both domestic and international markets have been experiencing significant inflationary pressures in recent years and inflation rates in the U.S., as well as in other countries in which we operate, are currently expected to continue at elevated levels for the near term. In addition, the Federal Reserve in the U.S. and other central banks in various countries have raised, and may again raise, interest rates in response to concerns about inflation, which, coupled with reduced government spending and volatility in financial markets, has had, and may continue to have, the effect of further increasing economic uncertainty and heightening these risks. Interest rate increases or other government actions taken to reduce inflation have resulted in, and may continue to result in, recessionary pressures in many parts of the world. Furthermore, currency exchange rates have been especially volatile in the recent past, and these currency fluctuations have affected, and may continue to affect, the reported value of our assets and liabilities, as well as our cash flows.We have experienced significant challenges to our global supply chain in recent periods, including production delays and interruptions, increased costs and shortages of raw materials and component parts (including resins and electromechanical devices), heightened inventory levels to reduce the risk of patient supply disruption and higher transportation and labor costs, resulting from COVID-19 and other exogenous factors including significant weather events, elevated inflation levels, disruptions to certain ports of call around the world, the war in Ukraine, the conflict in the Middle East (including recent attacks on merchant ships in the Red Sea), tensions between China and Taiwan and other geopolitical events. Due to the nature of our products, which include dense consumable medical products such as IV fluids, and the geographic locations of our manufacturing, storage and distribution facilities, which often require us to transport our products long distances and which are being further consolidated in anticipation of the proposed spinoff, we may be more susceptible to increases in freight costs and other supply chain challenges than certain of our industry peers. We expect to experience some of these and other challenges related to our supply chain in future periods. These challenges, including the unavailability of certain raw materials and component parts, have also had a negative impact on our sales for certain product categories due to our inability to fully satisfy demand and may continue to have a negative impact on our sales in the future.  They have also made it increasingly difficult to model accurately our short-term and long-term financial objectives and may continue to do so in the future. Our ability to generate cash flows from operations has been affected, and could continue to be affected, if there is a material decline in the demand for our products or, in the solvency or planned capital expenditures of our customers or suppliers, or if there is deterioration in our key financial ratios or credit ratings. Current or worsening economic conditions may impact the ability of our customers (including governments) to pay for our products and services and the amount spent on healthcare generally, which could result in decreased demand for our products and services, a decline in cash flows, longer sales cycles, increased inventory levels, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. These conditions may also adversely affect certain of our suppliers, which could disrupt our ability to produce products. We continue to do business with foreign governments in certain countries that have 13experienced deterioration in credit and economic conditions. While global economic conditions to date have not significantly impacted our ability to collect receivables, liquidity issues in certain countries have resulted, and may continue to result, in delays in the collection of receivables and credit losses and may also impact the stability of the U.S. Dollar, Euro, Renminbi or other currencies.Our operating results and financial condition have, and may in the future, fluctuate.Our operating results and financial condition have, and may in the future, fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year for a number of reasons. Events, such as changes to our expectations, strategy or forecasts (including as a result of evolving global macroeconomic conditions and updated expectations regarding the timing of new regulatory approvals) or even a relatively small revenue shortfall or increase in supply chain or other costs which we are unable to offset have, and may in the future, cause financial results for a period to be below our expectations or projections. As a result, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful, nor should they be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our operating results and financial condition are also subject to fluctuation from all of the risks described throughout this section. These fluctuations may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and our stock price.We may not achieve our financial goals.We continue to evaluate and refine both our short-term and long-term financial objectives, including our stated commitment to achieve certain net leverage targets. Our ability to achieve these targets depends, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the Hillrom acquisition (and related cost and revenue synergy targets) while working to execute on our stated portfolio management and other ongoing strategic initiatives including the proposed spinoff. We may fail to achieve our targeted financial results if we are unsuccessful in implementing our strategies, our estimates or assumptions change or for any other reason. Our failure to achieve our financial goals could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We incurred a substantial amount of debt in connection with the Hillrom acquisition, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We incurred acquisition-related debt financing of $11.80 billion to fund the cash consideration for the Hillrom acquisition, refinance certain indebtedness of Hillrom and pay related fees and expenses. Our substantially increased indebtedness and higher debt-to-equity ratio following the acquisition has the effect, among other things, of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and has increased our borrowing costs (including as a result of the downgrades in our senior debt credit ratings since 2021). The increased level of indebtedness and our future financial performance could also reduce funds available (under our credit facilities or otherwise) for investments in product development, capital expenditures, dividend payments, acquisitions, share repurchases and other activities and may create competitive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels. In addition, until we achieve our commitment to reduce our indebtedness following the Hillrom acquisition, our capital allocation activities and operational flexibility is limited. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in doing so on a timely basis or at all.Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates have, and may in the future have, an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity.We generate the majority of our net sales and profit outside the United States. As a result, our results of operations have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or our ability to mitigate these risks. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, additional volatility as a result of inflation and other macroeconomic factors, including in emerging market countries. We are also exposed to changes in interest rates, and our ability to access the money markets and capital markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all, could be impeded if market conditions are not favorable. For more information see “Financial Instrument Market Risk” in Item 7. Management's Discussion of Analysis and Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Our common stock price has fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future. The price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to:•market perceptions of any strategic actions or other developments related to our business including, for example, the proposed spinoff;14•variations in our net sales, earnings or other financial results from investors’ expectations or our previously issued guidance;•departure of key personnel;•fluctuations in the results of our operations and general conditions in the economy, our market, and the markets served by our customers, including with respect to technological advances; and•the operating and stock performance of comparable companies or related industries.In addition, prices in the stock market have generally been volatile in recent years. In certain cases, the fluctuations have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies. As a result, the price of our common stock could also fluctuate in the future without regard to our operating performance.Future material impairments in the value of our goodwill, intangible assets and other long-lived assets would negatively affect our operating results.We regularly review our goodwill, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment for potential impairment. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment reviews on an annual basis and whenever potential impairment indicators are present. Intangible assets subject to amortization and property, plant and equipment are reviewed for potential impairment when there is an indication that an impairment may have occurred. Adverse changes to macroeconomic conditions or our earnings forecasts, as well as changes in our strategic goals or business direction, could lead to impairment charges. In addition, we may from time to time pursue the sale of assets that we determine are not critical to our strategy, including in connection with strategic exits, such as the proposed spinoff. Such transactions could result in impairment charges if the estimated fair value of the assets, less costs to sell, is less than their related carrying amount. Material impairment charges would negatively affect our results of operations. For example, as described in more detail in Note 4 of Item 8 of this Annual Report, we recognized $510 million of long-lived asset impairment charges related to the HD business within our Kidney Care segment during 2023. Additionally, as described in more detail in Note 5 of Item 8 of this Annual Report, we recognized $2.81 billion of goodwill impairments and $332 million of indefinite-lived intangible asset impairments during 2022, both related to assets acquired in connection with our December 2021 acquisition of Hillrom. Further adverse changes to macroeconomic conditions or our earnings forecasts could lead to additional goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges in future periods and such charges could be material to our results of operations. For more information on the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, see “Critical Accounting Policies” in Item 7. Management's Discussion of Analysis and Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Other Risks Relating to Our BusinessIf we are unable to successfully introduce or monetize new and existing products or services, or fail to keep pace with changing consumer preferences and needs or advances in technology, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.We need to successfully introduce or monetize new and existing products and services to achieve our strategic business objectives. We can provide no assurances that our new products will achieve commercial acceptance in the marketplace, or that we will be able to separately bill for new or existing services. In addition, difficulties in manufacturing or in obtaining regulatory approvals have delayed, and may in the future delay or prohibit, the introduction of new products into the marketplace. We may not be able to obtain patent protection on our new products or be able to defend our intellectual property rights globally. Warranty claims and service costs relating to our new products might be greater than anticipated, and we might be required to devote significant resources to address any quality issues associated with our new products, which could reduce the resources available for further new product development and other matters. In addition, the introduction of new products and services might also cause customers to defer purchases of existing products or services. Our future financial performance will also depend in part on our ability to influence, anticipate, identify and respond to changing consumer preferences and needs. We might not correctly anticipate or identify trends in customer preferences or needs or might identify or react to them later than competitors do.In order to successfully introduce or monetize new and existing products and services, we must commit, and continue to commit, substantial funds, and other resources to R&D. Failure to successfully introduce new products or services in a cost-effective manner, or delays in customer purchasing decisions related to the evaluation of new products or services, could cause us to lose market share and could materially adversely affect our business. Furthermore, product development requires substantial investment and there is inherent risk in the R&D process. A 15successful product development process further depends on many other factors, including our ability to adapt to new technologies, demonstrate satisfactory clinical results and differentiate our products from those of our competitors. If we cannot successfully introduce new competitive products or adapt to changing technologies, our products may become obsolete and our net sales and profitability could suffer. Issues with product quality could have an adverse effect on our business or cause a loss of customer confidence in us or our products, among other negative consequences.The development of new or enhanced products involves a lengthy regulatory process and is capital intensive. As a result, our ability to match our production levels and capacity to market demand is imprecise and may result in a failure to meet market demand or satisfy customer requirements for our products or, alternatively, an oversupply of inventory. Increased costs relating to freight, raw materials or component parts and difficulties hiring and retaining staff have had and may continue to have, a negative impact on product supply. Failure to meet market demand may result in customers transitioning to available competitive products, loss of market share, negative publicity, reputational damage, loss of customer confidence or other negative consequences (including a decline in stock price). Our success also depends on our ability to maintain and routinely improve product quality and our quality management program. Quality management plays an essential role in meeting customer requirements, preventing defects, improving our products and services and assuring the safety and efficacy of our products. While we have a quality system that covers the lifecycle of our products, quality and safety issues have occurred, and may in the future occur, with respect to our products. For example, we have experienced certain Class I recalls related to our Novum IQ Syringe and infusion systems, SIGMA Spectrum pump and Life2000 Ventilator. New or unintended uses of our products (for example, in response to changing clinical practice) may also raise quality or safety issues. A quality or safety issue may result in negative publicity, product recalls (either voluntary or required by the FDA or similar governmental authorities in other countries), adverse regulatory site inspection reports, voluntary or official action indicated classifications, warning letters, import bans or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions (which may include corporate integrity agreements), costly litigation, refusal of a government to grant approvals and licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. See “—Risks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters.” An inability to address a quality or safety issue in an effective and timely manner may also cause negative publicity, potentially leading to a loss of customer confidence in us or our current or future products, which may result in the loss of sales and difficulty in successfully launching new products. Additionally, we have made, and could in the future make, significant investments in assets, including inventory and property, plant and equipment, which relate to potential new products or modifications to existing products. Product quality or safety issues may restrict us from being able to realize the expected returns from these investments, potentially resulting in asset impairments in the future.Unaffiliated third-party suppliers provide a number of goods and services to our R&D, clinical and manufacturing organizations, many of whom do so on a spot basis and not pursuant to a contractual arrangement. Our ability to receive goods or services at all or on reasonable financial terms from these third parties will be impacted if they are unable or refuse to supply or service us. Moreover, we may have limited or no recourse if the goods or services are not subject to contractual terms. If we are unable to identify or secure regulatory approval for an alternative provider on reasonable terms, our ability to meet our obligations to our customers could be negatively impacted, which could adversely affect our financial results and our reputation. Additionally, third-party suppliers are required to comply with our quality standards and those of applicable regulatory bodies. Failure of a third-party supplier to provide compliant raw materials, component parts or supplies, give us adequate notice of issues or help us secure all required regulatory approvals for the use of their products or services has resulted in delays, service interruptions and quality-related issues, and may do so again in the future, and may negatively impact our business results and results of operations.There is substantial competition in the product markets in which we operate and the risk of declining demand and pricing pressures could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Although no single company competes with us in all of our businesses, we face substantial competition in all of our markets from international and domestic healthcare medical products and pharmaceutical companies and providers of all sizes, and these competitors often differ across our businesses. Competition is primarily focused on cost-effectiveness, price, service, product performance and technological innovation.  Competition may increase further as additional companies begin to enter our markets, launch new products or modify their existing products to compete directly with ours. If our competitors respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or we do not introduce new versions or upgrades to 16our product portfolio in response to those requirements, our products may be rendered obsolete or non-competitive. If our competitors develop more effective or affordable products or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than we do, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows will likely be negatively affected. For example, new developments such as pharmaceuticals that reduce the progression of chronic kidney disease into ESRD or reduce its incidence (including through weight loss), as well as innovations in technology and care delivery models, could materially adversely affect the demand for and future pricing and sale of our products and services. Furthermore, if we are forced to reduce our prices due to increased competition, our business could become less profitable. In addition, many healthcare industry companies, including healthcare systems, distributors, manufacturers, providers and insurers, are consolidating or have formed strategic alliances. As the healthcare industry consolidates and new entrants emerge, competition to provide goods and services to industry participants has become, and will continue to become, more intense. Further, this consolidation creates larger enterprises with greater negotiating power, which they can use to negotiate price concessions. If we face an increase in costs or are unable to achieve targeted price increases because of industry consolidation or otherwise, the long-term nature of our customer contracts or for other reasons, or if we lose customers as a result of consolidation, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected. Demand for our products and services depends in large part on overall demand in the healthcare market. With the healthcare market’s increased focus on asset and resource efficiency, as well as reimbursement constraints and competitive dynamics, we have seen margins for some of our products decline and they may continue to do so over time. Further, the competitive pressures in our industry could cause us to lose market share unless we increase our commercial investments or reduce our prices, which could adversely impact our operating results. These factors, along with possible legislative, regulatory and other developments, might result in significant shifts in market share among the industry’s major participants, which includes us. Accordingly, if we are unable to effectively differentiate ourselves from our competitors in terms of new products and diversification of our product portfolio, then our market share, sales and profitability could be adversely impacted through lower volume or decreased prices.Pandemics and other public health emergencies, or the fear thereof, have had, and may in the future have, a material adverse effect on our business. The nature and extent of future impacts are uncertain and unpredictable.Our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health emergencies, including epidemics and pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Pandemics or other public health emergencies have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our operations, supply chains and distribution systems, and have increased, and may continue to increase, our expenses, including due to preventive and precautionary measures that we, other businesses and governments have taken and may continue to take. A pandemic or other public health emergency has adversely affected, and many continue to adversely affect, our business in many ways, including, but not limited to, the following:•During the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced significant and unpredictable reductions and increases in demand for certain of our products as healthcare customers re-prioritized the treatment of patients. Some of our products are particularly sensitive to reductions in elective medical procedures. For example, many elective procedures were suspended or postponed in our principal markets as hospital systems prioritized treatment of COVID-19 patients or otherwise were required to comply with changing government guidelines. If patients and hospital systems de-prioritize, delay or cancel elective procedures in the future, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected.  Additionally, through the pandemic, certain portions of our patient populations (including End Stage Renal Disease patients) have experienced heightened mortality levels. Demand for related products and services may not rebound to pre-pandemic levels in light of these increased mortality rates.•A significant number of our customers, suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and vendors were adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, including obstacles relating to their ability to maintain the continuity of their on-site operations, which impacted demand for certain of our products and services. These impacts caused interruptions and delays in our supply chain, and may do so in the future, resulting in more expensive alternative sources of labor and materials and heightened supply chain costs. Any delay or shortage in the supply of components or materials or other operational or logistical challenges may impact our ability to satisfy consumer demand for our products in a timely manner or at all, which could harm our reputation, future sales and profitability. For example, we have experienced supply constraints for amino acid raw materials used in our parenteral nutrition products, as such materials are being used to produce 17COVID-19 vaccines. These constraints have resulted in certain product backorders and may do so in the future.•We have experienced, and may continue to experience, a loss of sales or profitability due to delayed payments, reduced demand or capital constraints (including potential insolvency) of healthcare professionals, hospitals and other customers, as well as suppliers and vendors facing liquidity or other financial issues. These liquidity issues, as well as other financial issues, could be exacerbated if prolonged high levels of unemployment or loss of insurance coverage impact patients’ ability to access treatments that use our products and services. •COVID-19 adversely impacted the continued service and availability of skilled personnel necessary to run our operations (and those of our customers). Any of these and other impacts have had, and could in the future have, a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The scope and duration of any future public health emergency will depend on a number of factors, including the potential emergence of a new pandemic, new variants of COVID-19, the pace at which government restrictions are imposed and lifted and the extent of such restrictions, the scope of additional actions taken to mitigate the spread of disease and the availability and effectiveness and acceptance of vaccines. The effect of such a health emergency on our business will also vary based on the speed with and extent to which global markets and utilization rates for our products fully recover from the disruptions caused by such a public health emergency. The impact of these and other factors on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. Finally, to the extent COVID-19 or any future public health emergency adversely affects our operations and global economic conditions more generally, many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors
” section may be heightened.If we fail to attract, develop, retain and engage key employees, our business may suffer.Our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract, develop, retain and engage key employees, including people in senior management, sales, marketing, information technology and R&D positions, as well as our ability to transfer the knowledge and expertise of our workforce to new employees as our employees retire or we otherwise experience employee turnover (including in connection with the completion of acquisitions or divestitures or the proposed spinoff). Competition for top talent in the healthcare industry can be intense, especially for experienced management and technical and professional employees, which could increase costs associated with identifying, attracting and retaining such individuals. Our ability to recruit, develop, retain and engage such talent will depend on a number of factors, including hiring practices of our competitors, compensation and benefits (as may be impacted by any financial performance challenges), work location, work environment (including our competitors’ policies regarding remote or hybrid work arrangements), the market’s perception of our ongoing strategic initiatives, including the proposed spinoff, and industry economic conditions. Further, a lack of employee engagement could lead to loss of productivity and increased employee burnout, turnover, absenteeism, product quality incidents and decreased customer and patient satisfaction. If we cannot effectively recruit, develop, retain and engage qualified employees, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted.Risks Relating to Our Business Operations Segments of our business are significantly dependent on major contracts with GPOs, IDNs, and certain other distributors and purchasers.A portion of our U.S. hospital sales and rentals are made pursuant to contracts with hospital GPOs. At any given time, we are typically at various stages of responding to bids, negotiating and renewing expiring GPO agreements. Failure to be awarded certain of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business, including product sales and service and rental revenue. In addition, we have faced and continue to face challenges related to increasing costs associated with these agreements (associated with ongoing supply chain challenges and inflation), which have negatively impacted our revenues and may continue to do so in the future.Our participation in these agreements often requires increased discounting or restrictions on our ability to raise prices, and failure to participate or to be awarded these agreements might result in a reduction of sales to the member hospitals. In addition, in recent years, select market participants have shown an increased focus on individual GPO members negotiating directly with manufacturers on committed contracts. IDNs and health systems, when negotiating directly with manufacturers, often request additional discounts or other enhancements. Further, certain other distributors and purchasers have similar processes to the GPOs and IDNs and failure to be included in agreements with these other purchasers could have a material adverse effect on our business.18We may not be successful in achieving expected operating efficiencies and sustaining or improving operating expense reductions, and might experience business disruptions and adverse tax consequences associated with restructuring, realignment and cost reduction activities.Portions of our business have been, and may in the future be, the subject of restructuring, realignment and cost reduction initiatives. For example, we recently divested our BPS business and have implemented a simplified operating model and we continue to work toward simplifying our manufacturing footprint and completing the proposed spinoff. While we are undertaking these actions, as well as any future initiatives, with the goal of realizing potential efficiencies, we may not be successful in achieving efficiencies and cost reduction benefits we expect in full or at all. Further, such benefits might be realized later than expected, and the ongoing costs of implementing these measures might be greater than anticipated. If these measures are not successful or sustainable, we might undertake additional realignment and cost reduction efforts, which could result in future charges. Moreover, our ability to achieve our other strategic goals and business plans might be adversely affected, and we could experience business disruptions, if our restructuring and realignment efforts and our cost reduction activities prove ineffective. These actions, the resulting costs, and potential delays or potential lower than anticipated benefits might also impact our foreign tax positions and might require us to record tax reserves against certain deferred tax assets in our international business.If we are unable to obtain sufficient components or raw materials on a timely basis or for a cost-effective price or if we experience other manufacturing, sterilization, supply or distribution difficulties, our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows may be adversely affected.The manufacture of our products requires, among other things, the timely supply or delivery of sufficient amounts of quality components and raw materials. We manufacture our products in approximately 60 principal manufacturing locations. We acquire our components, raw materials and other requirements for manufacturing from many suppliers and vendors in various countries, including sometimes from ourselves for self-supplied requirements. We endeavor, either alone or working closely with our suppliers, to ensure the continuity of our inputs and supplies, but we cannot guarantee these efforts will always be successful. Further, while efforts are made to diversify certain of our sources of components and raw materials, in certain instances there is only a sole source or supplier with no acceptable alternatives yet identified and, as applicable, qualified. Additionally, we obtain certain components and materials on a spot basis from third party suppliers with whom we do not have contractual arrangements. For most of our components and raw materials for which a single source or supplier is used, alternative sources or suppliers may exist, but we have made a strategic determination to use the single source or supplier. Although we carry strategic inventory and maintain insurance to help mitigate the potential risk related to supply disruption, such measures may not be sufficient or effective. A reduction, interruption or suspension in supply, other supply chain issues, including those due to the revocation of distribution facilities’ licenses or as a result of our ongoing strategic initiatives, and our inability to quickly develop acceptable alternative sources for such supply could adversely affect our ability to manufacture, distribute and sell our products in a timely or cost-effective manner and could prevent us from satisfying obligations under one or more of our customer contracts or arrangements, which could result in significant failure to supply penalties. We have faced, and may in the future face, difficulties obtaining supplies of key materials, such as electromechanical components, active ingredients for pharmaceuticals and resins, due to supply chain disruptions and global pandemics. Moreover, changes in regulation, world trade policies, international taxes and government-to-government relations and issues with export and import activities could negatively impact our ability to distribute products within a country and across countries. See “—Risks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters.” Additionally, our success depends upon the availability and quality of our products and the underlying raw materials and component parts. The medical products and pharmaceutical industries are competitive and subject to complex market dynamics and varying demand levels. These levels vary in response to economic conditions, regulatory requirements, seasonality, natural disasters, wars, acts of terrorism, pandemics, epidemics and other matters. Significant increases in the cost of raw materials, sub-assemblies or materials used in the production of our products that cannot be recovered through increased prices of our products (or the unavailability of those raw materials, sub-assemblies or production materials) have adversely affected our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and may continue to do so in the future. There can be no assurance that the marketplace will support higher prices or that such prices and productivity gains will fully offset any commodity cost increases in the future. From time to time, we enter into fixed price supply contracts with respect to raw material purchases. Future decisions not to enter into fixed price supply contracts may result in increased cost volatility, potentially adversely impacting our profitability. Volatility in the demand for our products or our costs of energy, transportation, freight, raw materials and component parts and other supply, manufacturing, distribution and warehousing or storage costs have adversely affected, and could in the future adversely affect, our business, results 19of operations, financial condition and cash flows and have prevented, and may continue to prevent, suppliers from providing goods and services to us on reasonable terms or at all. See also “Risks Relating to Our Financial Performance and Our Common Stock—Global economic conditions, including inflation and supply chain disruptions, have adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, our operations.” Many of our products are difficult to manufacture. This is due to the complex nature of manufacturing devices and pharmaceuticals, including biologics, as well as the strict regulatory regime governing our manufacturing operations. Variations in the manufacturing process may result in production failures which could lead to launch delays, product shortage, unanticipated costs, lost revenues and damage to our reputation. A failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers may also result in a quality or safety issue of the type discussed in the “Risk Factors
” section.We rely heavily on a limited number of providers of transport services for reliable and secure point-to-point transport of our products to our customers and patients and for tracking of these shipments, and from time to time we require warehousing for our products. If any of these providers were to encounter delivery performance issues such as loss, damage or destruction of any systems or machines, it would be costly to replace such systems or machines in a timely manner and such occurrences may damage our reputation and lead to decreased demand for our products and increased cost and expense to our business.  Some of our products are manufactured at a single manufacturing facility or stored at a single storage site. Additionally, some of our manufacturing facilities are located in the same geographic area. Loss or damage to, or closure of, a manufacturing facility or storage site due to a natural disaster, such as we experienced as a result of Hurricane Maria, a pandemic, such as COVID-19, war or acts of terrorism or otherwise could adversely affect our ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of key products or deliver products to meet customer demand or contractual requirements, which may result in a loss of revenue and other adverse business consequences, including those identified in the paragraphs above. We may be unable to transfer manufacturing of the relevant products to another facility or location in a cost-effective or timely manner, if at all. This potential inability to transfer production could occur for several reasons, including, but not limited to, a lack of necessary relevant manufacturing capability at another facility, or the regulatory requirements of FDA or other governmental regulatory bodies. Such an event could materially negatively impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, several of our manufacturing facilities are leased and we may not be able to renew leases on favorable terms or at all. Because of the time required to approve and license a manufacturing facility, a third-party manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis (if at all) to replace production capacity in the event we lose manufacturing capacity or products are otherwise unavailable. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Some of our products require sterilization prior to sale or distribution, and we utilize both Baxter-owned and third-party facilities for this process. If an event occurs that results in damage to or closure, whether temporarily or permanent, of one or more of these facilities, we may be unable to manufacture or sterilize the relevant products at prior levels or at all, and a third party may not be available on a timely basis (if at all) to replace sterilization capacity. For example, in 2021, our facility in Mountain Home, Arkansas entered into a Consent Administrative Order with the Arkansas Division of Environmental Quality relating to certain air emissions control technology used to reduce ethylene oxide emissions from sterilization equipment. Although the events giving rise to the Consent Administrative Order only caused a temporary pause in operations, these events or other disruptions of manufacturing or sterilization processes that we or third parties may experience, whether due to a lack of capacity, environmental, regulatory or compliance issues (including evolving regulatory requirements) or otherwise, could result in product shortage, unanticipated costs, loss of revenues, operational restrictions, additional capital expenditure requirements, litigation and damage to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Climate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change, could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.The long-term effects of climate change are difficult to predict and may be widespread. The impacts of climate change may include physical risks (such as water scarcity, rising sea levels or frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions, including natural disasters such as hurricanes, cyclones and typhoons), social and human effects (such as population dislocations or harm to health and well-being), compliance costs and transition risks (including due to regulatory or technology changes), shifts in market trends (for example if customers increasingly prioritize purchasing products that are sustainably made and that can be reused or recycled) and other adverse effects. Such impacts, such as damage to manufacturing facilities, local infrastructure and utilities (including as a 20result of Hurricane Maria) have disrupted, and may in the future disrupt, our supply chain and manufacturing operations by adversely affecting our ability to procure goods or services required for the operation of our business at the quantities and levels we require due to impairment of the availability and increases in the cost of certain products, materials, commodities and energy. For example, material or sustained increases in the price of oil have had an adverse impact on the cost of many of the plastic materials or resins we use to make and package our products, as well as our transportation/freight costs. Further, the impacts of climate change, particularly severe weather events and droughts, have negatively impacted, and may in the future negatively impact, our ability to obtain material energy and water sources and other resources, including employee availability and access to shipping routes. Any of these outcomes may, in turn, result in customers transitioning to available competitive products, loss of market share, negative publicity, reputational damage, loss of customer confidence or other negative consequences, such as a decline in stock price. Further, any perceived increase in the potential of severe weather events and business interruption may put an upward pressure on the cost of our risk insurance premiums, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.In addition, the increasing concern over climate change has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, more local, state, regional, federal and global legal and regulatory requirements relating to climate change, including regulating greenhouse gas emissions and related reporting requirements (and the establishment of enhanced internal processes or systems to track them), alternative energy policies and sustainability initiatives. Legislation and regulations have been, and are expected to continue to be, enacted and promulgated in the United States, United Kingdom, EU or in any other jurisdictions in which we do business that impose more stringent restrictions and requirements than our current legal or regulatory obligations (as a result of our publicly disclosed corporate responsibility goals or otherwise), we may experience disruptions in, or increases in the costs associated with research, development, sourcing, manufacturing and distributing our products. Additionally, rising climate change concerns have led to and could continue to lead to additional regulation that could increase our compliance costs. As a result, any such regulatory changes could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition, result of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, companies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny from investors, regulators, and other stakeholders related to their ESG commitments, performance, and disclosures, including related to climate change, diversity and inclusion, and governance standards. Investor advocacy groups, certain institutional investors, lenders, investment funds, and other influential investors are increasingly focused on companies’ ESG commitments (including our corporate responsibility goals), performance, and disclosures, and in recent years have placed increasing importance on social costs and related implications of their investments. Additionally, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their respective approaches to ESG matters, which are increasingly being employed by investors, lenders, and customers to inform their investment, financing, or purchasing decisions. A failure to adequately meet stakeholder expectations, which may differ or conflict, may result in the loss of business, reputational impacts, diluted market valuation, an inability to attract customers, and an inability to attract and retain top talent.Breaches and breakdowns affecting our information technology systems or protected information, including from cyber security breaches and data leakage, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, reputation and competitive position.We rely upon information technology systems and infrastructure, including services provided by our partners and third parties, to support our business, products and customers. For example, we routinely rely on technology systems and infrastructure in the collection, use, storage and transfer, disclosure and other processing of voluminous amounts of protected information, including personal data, protected health information, and sensitive data (of patients, employees, customers and third parties) as well as confidential, business, financial, and other sensitive information (collectively, “Protected Information”). We also rely on systems for manufacturing, customer orders, shipping, regulatory compliance and various other matters. Certain of our products and systems collect Protected Information regarding patients and their therapies and some are internet enabled or connect to our systems for maintenance and other purposes. The acquisition of Hillrom in December 2021 increased the number of these products and systems within our portfolio. Some of our products connect to the internet, hospital networks, electronic medical record systems or electronic health record systems. Further, we expect that the breadth and complexity of our information and technology systems and infrastructure will increase as we expand our product offerings to utilize and generate data analytics and potentially artificial intelligence (which create emerging enterprise risks, including but not limited to cybersecurity, monitoring, and oversight). The continuing evolution of technology we use, including cloud-based computing and data hosting as well as artificial intelligence, and reliance on third parties, whom may also use cloud-based computing and data hosting or artificial intelligence tools, create 21additional opportunities for the unintentional, intentional, unauthorized or unlawful disclosure, exposure, dissemination, loss, alteration, access or destruction of Protected Information stored or processed in our devices, systems, servers, infrastructure and products (collectively, “Technology”). Security threats, including cyber and other attacks, have become very sophisticated, frequent and adaptive.Our Technology is vulnerable to breakdown, interruption, cyber and other security attacks, system malfunction, unauthorized access, inadvertent exposure or disclosure of information, theft and other events. Third-party systems that we rely upon are also vulnerable to the same risks and may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could result in system disruption or compromise the information security of our own systems. Any such vulnerability could compromise our Technology and could expose Protected Information to unauthorized third parties and/or cause temporary or permanent loss or unavailability of such Protected Information. In addition, our Technology may cause product functionality issues that could result in risk to patient safety, field actions or product recalls. We, like other large multi-national companies, have experienced cyber incidents in the past and may experience them in the future which have exposed and may continue to expose vulnerabilities in our information technology systems. Although the prior incidents have not had a material effect on our business and we have invested and continue to invest in the protection of data and Technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts (i) have prevented or will prevent future breakdowns, attacks, breaches in our Technology, cyber incidents or other incidents or (ii) ensure compliance with all applicable cybersecurity and privacy laws, regulations and standards, including with respect to third-party service providers that host or process Protected Information on our behalf. Any failure to protect against such incidents or non-compliance with applicable security and privacy laws, regulations and standards could lead to substantial and material regulatory fines and penalties, business disruption, reputational harm, financial loss or litigation, as well as other damages. Misappropriation or other loss of our intellectual property from any of the foregoing may have an adverse effect on our competitive position and may cause us to incur substantial litigation costs. See “Risks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters.” As our customers and FDA and other global regulators, including data protection authorities or supervisory bodies, become more sensitive to risks related to cybersecurity, our ability to meet certain information technology safety standards could affect our products’ marketability and competitiveness. We could also suffer strained relationships with customers, business partners, physicians and other healthcare professionals, increased costs (for security measures, remediation or otherwise), litigation (including class actions and stockholder derivative actions) or other negative consequences (including a decline in stock price) as a result of breaches, cyber and other security attacks, industrial espionage, ransomware, phishing scams, malware or other cyber incidents, which could compromise our system infrastructure and/or lead to data leakage, including at our third-party providers or other business partners. Although we maintain insurance related to cybersecurity risks, there can be no assurance that our insurance will cover a particular cyber incident at issue or that such coverage will be sufficient.In addition, significant implementation issues may arise as we continue to consolidate and outsource certain computer operations and application support activities, including as a result of our ongoing business transformation activities and in connection with the ongoing Hillrom integration and our other ongoing strategic initiatives, including the proposed spinoff). Further, a number of our employees have fully remote or hybrid work arrangements, which, among other things, expose us to heightened risks related to our information technology systems and networks, including cyber attacks, computer viruses, malicious software, security breaches and telecommunication failures, both for systems and networks we control directly and for those that employees and third-party developers rely on to work remotely. We also face all of the same risks listed above and other heightened risks when acquiring a company, in particular if we need to transition or implement certain processes or controls with the acquired company. For example, as we continue to integrate Hillrom into our business, we have identified certain potential areas of vulnerability as we transition its information technology systems, products and processes to our processes and controls, including with respect to cybersecurity and privacy matters. While we are working to fully address those vulnerabilities (consistent with our processes and controls) we do not believe any of them present any material risks to our business or operations (including with respect to our Technology). Any such vulnerabilities (or any others) if unidentified or unremediated could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We are subject to risks associated with doing business globally.Our operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business globally and under the laws, regulations and customs of various jurisdictions and geographies. These risks include changes in exchange controls and other governmental actions, loss of business in government and public tenders that are held annually in many cases, increasingly complex labor environments, availability of raw materials and component parts, changes in taxation, tariffs, export control restrictions, changes in or violations of U.S. or local laws, dependence on a few government entities as customers, pricing restrictions, economic and political instability, monetary or currency volatility or 22instability (including as it relates to the U.S. Dollar, the Euro, the Renminbi and currencies in emerging market countries), disputes between countries, trade relationships and conflicts, diminished or insufficient protection of intellectual property, and disruption or destruction of operations in a significant geographic region regardless of cause, including natural disaster, pandemic, power loss, cyber attack, data breach, war, terrorism, riot, labor disruption, civil insurrection or social unrest. Failure to comply with, or material changes to, the laws and regulations that affect our global operations could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.The escalating global economic competition and trade tensions among the United States, China and Russia could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Although we have been able to mitigate some of the impact from increased duties imposed by these countries (through petitioning the governments for tariff exclusions and other mitigations), the risk remains of additional tariffs and other kinds of restrictions. Tariff exclusions awarded to us by the United States Government require annual renewal, and policies for granting exclusions could shift. The United States, China and Russia could impose other types of restrictions such as limitations on government procurement or technology export restrictions, which could affect our access to the markets. See also “Risks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters—We are subject to a number of laws and regulations, non-compliance with which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and we are susceptible to a changing regulatory environment.”More generally, several governments have raised the possibility of policies to induce “re-shoring” of supply chains, less reliance on imported supplies and greater national production. For example, the Chinese government has issued a series of policies in the past several years to promote local medical devices or suggest government procurement budgets for local products. Another example is the stronger “Buy American” requirements in the U.S. (pursuant to a U.S. executive order on January 25, 2021). If such steps triggered retaliation in other markets, such as by restricting access to foreign products by their government-owned healthcare systems the outcomes could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.A portion of our workforce is unionized, and we could face labor disruptions that would interfere with our operations.Some of our employees both in and outside of the United States work under collective bargaining agreements or national trade union agreements or are subject to works councils. Although we have not recently experienced any significant work stoppages as a result of labor disagreements, we cannot ensure that such a stoppage will not occur in the future. For example, a collective bargaining agreement for one of our U.S. manufacturing facilities is scheduled to expire in January 2025. Our inability to negotiate satisfactory new agreements or a labor disturbance at any of our manufacturing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our operations.Risks Relating to Legal and Regulatory MattersWe are subject to a number of laws and regulations, non-compliance with which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and we are susceptible to a changing regulatory environment.As a participant in the healthcare industry, our operations and products, and those of our customers, are regulated by numerous government agencies, both inside and outside the United States. Laws and regulations, such as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the Healthcare Reform Act), which aim to decrease costs through comparative effectiveness research and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies. Compliance with these and similar regulations could result in pricing pressure or negatively impact the demand for our products. In a number of situations, even though specific laws and regulations may not directly apply to us, our products must be capable of being used by our customers in a manner that complies with those laws and regulations.The manufacture, distribution, marketing and use of our products are subject to extensive regulation and scrutiny by FDA and other regulatory authorities globally. Any new product must undergo lengthy and rigorous testing and other extensive, costly, and time-consuming procedures mandated by FDA and foreign regulatory authorities. The same testing and procedures sometimes apply to our products that are up for authorization or renewal or are subject to changes in laws or regulations. For example, our medical devices that are sold or distributed in the EU have to comply with the EU Medical Device Regulation that entered into force in May 2021. This Medical Device Regulation currently provides a staggered phase-in period for manufacturers to comply with related regulations through December 2028. These regulations require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in EU member states to meet certain quality system and safety requirements and ongoing product monitoring 23responsibilities and obtain a “CE” marking (i.e., a mandatory conformity marking for certain products sold within the European Economic Area) for their products. Various penalties exist for non-compliance with the laws implementing the European Medical Device Regulations which, if incurred, could have a material adverse impact on portions of our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Changes to current products may be subject to vigorous review, including additional FDA 510(k) and other regulatory submissions, and approvals or the time needed to secure approvals are not certain. We may not be able to obtain such approvals on the timing or conditions we expect, or at all. Our facilities must be approved and licensed prior to production and remain subject to inspection from time to time thereafter. Failure to comply with the requirements of FDA or other regulatory authorities, including a failed inspection or a failure in our adverse event reporting system, has resulted in, and could in the future result in, adverse inspection reports, voluntary or official action indicated, warning letters, import bans, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, reputational damage, injunctions to halt the manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a government to grant approvals or licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. The failure of our suppliers to comply with regulations could also adversely affect segments of our business as regulatory actions taken by FDA against those manufacturers can result in product shortages, recalls or modifications. Any of these actions could cause a loss of customer confidence in us and our products, which could adversely affect our sales. Our business is also subject to risks associated with U.S. and foreign legislation, regulations and trade agreements relating to the materials we import, including quotas, duties, tariffs or taxes, other charges or restrictions on imports and the nature of materials that can be used in our products, which could adversely affect our operations and our ability to import materials used in our products at current or increased levels. We cannot predict whether additional U.S. and foreign customs quotas, duties (including antidumping or countervailing duties), tariffs, taxes or other charges or restrictions, requirements as to where raw materials and component parts must be purchased, additional workplace regulations or other restrictions on our imports will be imposed in the future or adversely modified, or what effect such actions would have on our costs of operations. Future quotas, duties or tariffs may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Future trade agreements could also provide our competitors with an advantage over us, or increase our costs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. See also “Risks Relating to Our Business Operations—We are subject to risks associated with doing business globally.”The sales, marketing and pricing of products and relationships that medical device and pharmaceutical companies have with healthcare providers are under increased scrutiny by federal, state and foreign government agencies. Compliance with the Anti-Kickback Statute, False Claims Act, Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (including as these laws relate to off-label promotion of products) and other healthcare-related laws, as well as competition and export and import laws, is under increased focus by the agencies charged with overseeing such activities. The Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and the SEC are focused on the enforcement of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”), particularly as it relates to the conduct of medical product and pharmaceutical companies. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their employees, contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Healthcare professionals in many countries are employed by the government and consequently may be considered government officials. Foreign governments are also focused on examining medical product and pharmaceutical companies’ sales and marketing activities and relationships with healthcare providers and competitive practices generally. The laws and standards governing the promotion, pricing, sale and reimbursement of our products and those governing our relationships with healthcare providers and governments, including the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, are complicated, subject to frequent change and may be violated unknowingly. Compliance with these and similar laws (or failure to comply with these laws) could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  Additionally, failure to comply with applicable laws or our internal policies has resulted, and may result in the future, in the departure or termination of key personnel, which has the potential of disrupting our operations or future performance. Furthermore, governments have chosen (as in the case of the Chinese government) or may choose to prioritize anti-corruption efforts in the healthcare sector as part of their law enforcement activities.We are also subject to environmental laws, which are becoming more stringent throughout the world. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) regulates the use of ethylene oxide for sterilization of medical devices and is increasingly focused on reducing emissions from the ethylene oxide sterilization process, which has increased our costs of operations and necessitated changes to our manufacturing plants and processes. Additionally, the European Economic Area (the “EEA”) is phasing out the use of Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate in the immediate packaging of medicinal products and in medical devices, and the EEA is also considering regulations on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, fluorinated gases and Polyvinyl Chloride. Other governments globally have, or are considering, limiting or prohibiting the use of certain chemicals, including Polyvinyl Chloride and Diethyl 24Phthalate. These regulatory changes could adversely impact our ability to manufacture or supply certain products in the EEA. Other environmental laws may have similar consequences for us or our suppliers, or result in liability to us. Additionally, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control and the Bureau of Industry and Security at the U.S. Department of Commerce administer laws and regulations that restrict U.S. persons and, in some instances, non- U.S. persons, in conducting activities, transacting business or making investments in certain countries, or with governments, entities and individuals subject to U.S. economic sanctions. From time to time, certain of our subsidiaries have limited business dealings with and/or provide humanitarian donations to countries subject to comprehensive sanctions and/or embargoes, including Afghanistan, Belarus, Cuba, Russia, Syria and Venezuela. These dealings represent an insignificant amount of our combined net sales and income but expose us to an increased risk of operating in these countries, including foreign exchange risks or restrictions or limitations on our ability to access funds generated in these jurisdictions or the risk of violating applicable sanctions or regulations, which are complex and subject to frequent change. Our ethics and compliance programs, training, monitoring and policies may not always protect us from conduct by individual employees that violate these laws. Violations or allegations of violations of these laws may result in large civil and criminal penalties, debarment or exclusion from participating in government programs, diversion of management time, attention and resources and may otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The laws and regulations discussed above are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations and changes, which may be violated unknowingly, could require us to incur substantial costs regarding compliance or to alter our sales and marketing practices and may subject us to enforcement actions or litigation, and of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We cannot predict with certainty what laws, regulations and healthcare initiatives, if any, will be implemented, or what the ultimate effect of healthcare reform or any future legislation or regulation will have on us. For more information related to ongoing government investigations, see Note 8 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For more information on regulatory matters currently affecting us, including quality-related matters, see “Certain Regulatory Matters” in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Increasing regulatory focus on privacy and cybersecurity issues and expanding laws could impact our business and expose us to increased liability.As a global company, we are subject to global data privacy and cybersecurity laws, regulations and codes of conduct that apply to our businesses. We are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing legal and regulatory requirements and frameworks in the United States and in other countries that govern not only the collection, use, storage, security, transfer, disclosure and other processing of protected health information and personal and sensitive data, but also the timely disclosure of cybersecurity incidents. Further, new and emerging digital and technology laws are gradually being implemented globally and have a strong interplay with privacy and cybersecurity rules, which contributes to the complexity of the regulatory landscape. In the United States, we are subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as amended (HIPAA), the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and the California Consumer Privacy Act (the CCPA) and California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) as well as other new and emerging state laws. HIPAA imposes stringent data privacy and security requirements, and the regulatory authority has imposed significant fines and penalties on organizations found to be out of compliance. The CCPA provides consumers with a private right of action against companies that have a security breach due to a lack of appropriate security measures. In addition, to the HHS and the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) enforcement activity has become more intense, with higher fines, in areas related to heath data that are out of scope of HIPAA. Further, we are subject to the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (the GDPR) and the NIS2 Directive, an EU wide cybersecurity legislation, which will be fully in force in 2024. The GDPR imposes stringent EU data protection requirements and provides for significant penalties for noncompliance, including heightened fines as compared to prior years. Governmental bodies are increasingly imposing cyber-incident disclosure regulations with differing criteria for what incidents must be reported as well as the timelines in which to report them. We or our third-party providers and business partners may also be subjected to audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to compliance with information security and privacy laws and regulations, and noncompliance with such laws and regulations could result in substantial and material fines or class action litigation. If reimbursement or other payment for our current or future products is reduced or modified in the United States or in foreign countries, including through the implementation or repeal of government-sponsored 25healthcare reform or other similar actions, cost containment measures, or there are changes to policies with respect to pricing, taxation or rebates, our business could suffer.Sales of our products depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our products are paid by both public and private payers. These payers include Medicare, Medicaid, private healthcare insurers in the United States and foreign governments and third-party payers outside the United States. Our work with government payers carries various risks inherent in working with government entities and agencies, including government reporting and auditing, additional regulatory oversight, mandated contractual terms, failure of government appropriations and other complex procedural requirements.Public and private payers have challenged, and are expected to continue to challenge, prices charged for medical products and services. Such downward pricing pressures from any or all of these payers may result in an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Global efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing. Governments around the world continue to use various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures, such as price controls, the formation of public contracting authorities, product formularies, which are lists of recommended or approved products, and competitive tenders, which require the submission of a bid to sell products. Sales of our products are dependent, in part, on the availability of reimbursement by government agencies and healthcare programs, as well as insurance companies and other private payers. In much of Europe, Latin America, Asia and Australia, governments provide healthcare at low cost to patients and control their expenditures by various means, such as purchasing products through public tenders, collective purchasing, regulating prices, setting reference prices in public tenders and limiting reimbursement or patient access to certain products. For example, China has been implementing volume-based procurement policies, a series of centralized reforms being instituted in China on both a national and regional basis that has resulted in significant price cuts for pharmaceuticals and medical consumables. Additionally, austerity measures or other reforms by foreign governments may limit, reduce or eliminate payments for our products and adversely affect both pricing flexibility and demand for our products. In addition, operations within our Healthcare Systems and Technologies segment increase our exposure to risks related to reimbursement as certain portions of that business directly bill various government agencies.The Healthcare Reform Act includes several provisions which impact our businesses in the United States, including increased Medicaid rebates and an expansion of the 340B Drug Pricing Program, which provides certain qualified entities with discounts on the purchase of drugs for outpatient use and an excise tax on the sale of certain drugs. The Healthcare Reform Act reduces Medicare and Medicaid payments to hospitals and other providers, which may cause us to experience downward pricing pressure. Certain portions of the Healthcare Reform Act could negatively impact the demand for our products, and therefore our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.   In 2019, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services launched a new kidney health initiative. The CMS published the final ESRD Treatment Choices (ETC) mandatory payment model in 2020. The ETC launched in 30% of dialysis clinics across the country on January 1, 2021 and creates payment incentives for the greater use of home dialysis and kidney transplants for those new to and already on dialysis. CMS also announced the implementation of four voluntary payment models with the stated goal of helping healthcare providers reduce the cost and improve the quality of care for patients with late-stage chronic kidney disease and ESRD. In addition, the 2022 Physician Fee Schedule issued by CMS has extended coverage of certain Medicare telehealth services through December 31, 2023 and the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2023 further extended such coverage through December 31, 2024. While the availability of telehealth services can improve access to medical care, increased reliance on, and utilization of, telemedicine for delivery of healthcare services increases the risk of privacy and data breaches and cyberattacks. These proposed regulatory changes in kidney health policy and reimbursement may substantially change the U.S. end stage renal disease market and could increase demand for our peritoneal dialysis products, necessitating significant multi-year capital expenditures in order to meet that demand. However, the impact of such changes and related expenses are difficult to estimate in advance.In addition, a substantial portion of our revenues is dependent on federal healthcare program reimbursement, and any disruptions in federal government operations, including a federal government shutdown or failure of the U.S. government to enact annual appropriations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Additionally, disruptions in federal government operations may negatively impact regulatory approvals and guidance that are important to our operations and create uncertainty about the pace of upcoming healthcare regulatory developments or approvals.As a result of these and other measures, including future measures or reforms that cannot be predicted, reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive basis. Legislation and regulations affecting reimbursement for our products may change at any time and in ways that may be adverse 26to us. We cannot predict the impact of these pressures and initiatives, or any negative effects of any additional regulations that may affect our business. We could be subject to fines or damages and possible exclusion from participation in federal or state healthcare programs if we fail to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our business.Portions of our business are subject to stringent laws and regulations at the federal or state levels governing the participation of durable medical equipment suppliers and independent diagnostic testing facilities in federal and state healthcare programs. From time to time, the U.S. government seeks additional information related to our claims submissions, and in some instances government contractors perform audits of payments made to us under Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal healthcare programs. On occasion, these reviews identify overpayments for which we submit refunds. At other times, our own internal audits identify the need to refund payments. We believe the frequency and intensity of government audits and review processes has grown, and we expect this will continue, due to increased resources allocated to these activities at both the federal and state Medicaid level, and greater sophistication in data review techniques.In addition, our business contracts with foreign and U.S. federal, state and local government entities are subject to specific rules, regulations and approvals applicable to government contractors. Our failure to comply with these could result in contract terminations, suspension or debarment from contracting with these entities, civil fines and damages, criminal prosecution and possible exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, as well as possible recoupment of any overpayments related to such violations. While we believe that our practices materially comply with applicable state, federal and foreign requirements, the requirements might be interpreted in a manner inconsistent with our interpretation. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, even if inadvertent, could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.If we are unable to protect or enforce our patents or other proprietary rights, or if we become subject to claims or litigation alleging infringement of the patents or other proprietary rights of others, our competitiveness and business prospects may be materially damaged.Patent and other proprietary rights are essential to our business. Our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain and enforce patents and licenses to patent rights, both in the United States and in other countries. We cannot guarantee that our pending patent applications, or any future patent applications, will result in issued patents, our patents issued or licensed will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, our patents will not be found to be invalid or the intellectual property rights of others will not prevent us from selling certain products or including key features in our products.The patent position of a healthcare company is often uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. Significant litigation concerning patents and products is pervasive in our industry. Patent claims include challenges to the coverage and validity of our patents on products or processes as well as allegations that our products infringe patents held by competitors or other third parties. An unfavorable litigation outcome in any of these types of cases could result in a loss of patent protection or the ability to market products, which could lead to a significant loss of sales, or otherwise materially affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We also rely on trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and know-how to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive positions. Third parties may know, discover or independently develop equivalent proprietary information or techniques, or they may gain access to our trade secrets or publicly disclose our trade secrets.Although our employees, consultants, parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners are generally subject to confidentiality or similar agreements to protect our confidential and proprietary information, these agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. To the extent that our employees, consultants, parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.Furthermore, our intellectual property, proprietary technology and sensitive company data is potentially vulnerable to loss, damage and misappropriation from system malfunction, computer viruses and unauthorized access to our data or misappropriation or misuse thereof by those with permitted access and other events. While we have invested to protect our intellectual property, confidential information and other data, and continue to work diligently in this area, there can be no assurance that our precautionary measures have prevented or will prevent future breakdowns, breaches, cyber incidents or other events. See also “Risks Relating to Our Business Operations—Breaches and breakdowns affecting our information technology systems or protected information, including from cyber security breaches and data leakage, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial 27condition, cash flows, reputation and competitive position.” Any of the events referenced above could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities may have a negative impact on our operating results.Changes to the tax laws in the United States or other countries in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our operating results. For example, the Organization of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (the Inclusive Framework) has put forth two proposals—Pillar One and Pillar Two—that revise the existing profit allocation and nexus rules and ensure a minimal level of taxation, respectively. On December 12, 2022, the EU member states agreed to implement the Inclusive Framework’s global corporate minimum tax rate of 15%, and various countries both within and outside the EU have enacted new laws implementing Pillar Two or have draft legislation proposed for adoption. The OECD continues to release additional guidance on the two-pillar framework, with widespread implementation in 2024. We are continuing to evaluate the potential impact of the Inclusive Framework on future periods, pending legislative adoption by individual countries, which could have an adverse impact on our effective tax rate, income tax expense and cash flows.Taxing authorities audit us from time to time and may disagree with certain positions we have taken in respect of our tax liabilities. Our tax liabilities are affected by many factors, including the amounts we charge in intra-company transactions for inventory, services, licenses, funding and other items, which are subject to the use of assumptions and judgment. Because we operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States, cross border transactions among our affiliates are a significant part of the manner in which we operate. Although we believe that we transact intra-company business in accordance with arm’s-length principles, tax authorities may disagree with our intra-company charges, cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters, and may assess additional taxes as a result, including in connection with their review of the restated financial statements we have filed as part of our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. However, we may not accurately predict the outcome of these audits and, as a result, the actual outcome of these audits may have an adverse impact on our financial results. For more information on ongoing audits, see Note 14 in Item 8 of this Annual Report.We are party to a number of pending lawsuits and other disputes which may have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We are party to a number of pending lawsuits, settlement discussions, mediations, arbitrations and other disputes, some of which are set forth in Note 8 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, in the future we may be party to additional lawsuits, disputes or other matters, including patent, product liability or other lawsuits. These current and future matters may result in a loss of patent protection, reduced net sales, incurrence of significant liabilities and diversion of our management’s time, attention and resources. Given the uncertain nature of litigation and other disputes generally, we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in our current matters. In view of these uncertainties, the outcome of these current matters may result in charges in excess of any established reserves, and, to the extent available, liability insurance. We also continue to be self-insured with respect to product liability claims. The unavailability or inadequacy of third-party insurance coverage for current or future liability claims could increase our potential exposure to unanticipated claims and adverse decisions. Protracted litigation and other disputes, including any adverse outcomes, may have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Even claims without merit could subject us to adverse publicity and require us to incur significant legal fees.Our Amended and Restated Bylaws designate certain courts in the State of Delaware or the federal district courts of the United States will be the sole and exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees. Our Amended and Restated Bylaws (Bylaws) provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware (or, if no state court located in the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware) is the sole and exclusive forum, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to bring (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim for or based on a breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director or officer or other employee of the company to the company or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or our Certificate of Incorporation or these 28Bylaws, as either may be amended from time to time, or (iv) any action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws or (v) any other action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine or that is otherwise an “internal corporate claim” as defined in Section 115 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. The exclusive forum provisions of our Bylaws are not a waiver of, and do not relieve person or entity of duties to comply with, federal securities laws including those specifying the exclusive jurisdiction of federal courts under the Exchange Act and concurrent jurisdiction of federal and state courts under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our common stock is deemed to have received notice of and consented to the foregoing provisions of our Bylaws described above. The choice of forum provision may result in increased costs for investors to bring a claim. Further, the choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, other employees, or stockholders, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, other employees, or stockholders. However, the enforceability of similar forum provisions in other companies’ certificates of incorporation or bylaws have been challenged in legal proceedings. If a court were to find the exclusive choice of forum provision contained in our Bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions"
8,BAX,BAXTER INTERNATIONAL INC,2023-02-09,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
.  In addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, stockholders or prospective investors should carefully consider the following risk factors. If any of the events described below occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, future growth prospects and stock price could suffer.Risk Factors

our business are significantly dependent on major contracts with GPOs, IDNs, and certain other distributors and purchasers.•We may not be successful in achieving expected operating efficiencies and sustaining or improving operating expense reductions, and might experience business disruptions and adverse tax consequences associated with restructuring, realignment and cost reduction activities.9•If we are unable to obtain sufficient components or raw materials on a timely basis or for a cost-effective price or if we experience other manufacturing, sterilization, supply or distribution difficulties, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.•Climate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.•Breaches and breakdowns affecting our information technology systems or protected information could have a material adverse effect on

rights, or if we infringe the patents or other proprietary rights of others, our competitiveness and business prospects may be materially damaged.•Changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities may have a negative impact on our operating results.•We are party to a number of pending lawsuits and other disputes which may have an adverse impact on our business, operations or financial condition.Strategic RisksThe proposed spinoff of our Renal Care and Acute Therapies product categories may not be completed on the terms or timeline currently contemplated, if at all.We recently announced a series of strategic actions, including the proposed spinoff of our Renal Care and Acute Therapies product categories, a review of strategic alternatives for our BPS product category and plans to implement a simplified operating model and manufacturing footprint. We may encounter challenges to executing the proposed spinoff of our Renal Care and Acute Therapies product categories on the terms and within the timeframe we announced, or at all. The spinoff will be subject to the satisfaction of a number of customary conditions, including final approval from the Baxter Board of Directors, the filing and effectiveness of a registration statement on Form 10, receipt of a favorable Internal Revenue Service ruling or tax opinion from counsel with respect to the tax-free nature of the spin, satisfactory completion of financing arrangements and receipt of any necessary regulatory approvals. The failure to satisfy any of the required conditions could delay the completion of the proposed spinoff for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring at all. Additionally, it is complex in nature, and unanticipated developments or changes, including disruptions in general market conditions, changes in law or challenges in executing the separation of the two businesses, may affect our ability to complete the spinoff on the terms or on the timeline we announced, or at all. The terms and conditions of the required regulatory authorizations and consents that are granted, if any, may also impose requirements, limitations or costs, or place restrictions on the conduct of the independent companies or impact our ability to complete the spinoff on the terms or timeline we announced, or at all. Although we intend for the proposed spinoff to be tax-free to the company’s stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we expect to incur non-U.S. cash taxes on the preparatory restructuring and may also incur non-cash tax expense including potential impairments of deferred tax assets. Moreover, there can be no assurance that the proposed spinoff will qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The IRS ruling or opinion from counsel 10mentioned above will be based upon various factual representations and assumptions, as well as certain undertakings made by the Company and the new independent company. If any of these factual representations or assumptions are, or become, untrue or incomplete in any material respect, an undertaking is not complied with, or the facts upon which the opinion or ruling are based are materially different from the actual facts relating to the spinoff, reliance on the opinion or ruling may be jeopardized. If the spinoff were ultimately determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we would incur a significant tax liability, while the distributions to the company’s stockholders would become taxable and the new independent company could incur income tax liabilities as well.We will be exposed to new risks as a result of the proposed spinoff and other strategic actions we are undertaking. Our strategic actions may not achieve their anticipated benefits, or our costs may exceed our estimates.Our businesses will face material challenges in connection with the proposed spinoff and the other strategic actions we are undertaking (including a review of strategic alternatives for our BPS product category and plans to implement a simplified operating model and manufacturing footprint). These challenges include, without limitation, the diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business concerns; appropriately allocating assets and liabilities among the companies to be separated in the proposed spinoff, particularly given the complex nature of the spinoff; attracting, retaining and motivating key management and other employees; retaining existing, or attracting new, business and operational relationships, including with customers, suppliers, employees and other counterparties; maintaining our relationships with regulators; assigning customer contracts and intellectual property to each of the businesses; and potential negative reactions from the financial markets. In particular, in the last few years, the company has undertaken other strategic and business transformation actions (including the acquisition of Hillrom and cost reduction initiatives) that have entailed changes across our organizational structure, senior leadership, culture, functional alignment, outsourcing and other areas. This poses risks in the form of personnel capacity constraints and institutional knowledge loss that has led to and could in the future lead to missed performance or financial targets and harm to our reputation, and these risks are heightened with the additional interdependent actions that will be needed to complete the proposed spinoff and other strategic actions we are pursuing. We have begun and will continue to incur significant expenses in connection with the proposed spinoff and other strategic actions we have announced. These expenses may be higher than currently anticipated or may not yield a discernible benefit if the actions are not completed on schedule or at all. In addition, the anticipated benefits of these actions are based on a number of assumptions, some of which may prove incorrect, and we cannot predict with certainty when the expected benefits will occur, or the extent to which they will be achieved. As a result, even if the proposed spinoff or other strategic actions are completed, they may not achieve some or all of the anticipated strategic, financial, operational or other benefits in the expected timeframe, or at all, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations or financial condition. Further, even if the proposed spinoff is completed, we cannot assure you that each separate company will be successful. Completion of the spinoff will result in independent public companies that are smaller, less diversified companies, with more limited businesses concentrated in their respective industries than Baxter is today. As a result, each company will be more vulnerable to changing market conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the diversification of revenues, costs and cash flows will diminish, such that each company’s results of operations, cash flows, working capital, effective tax rate and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility, and each company’s ability to fund capital expenditures and investments, pay dividends and meet debt obligations and other liabilities may be diminished. Each company will also incur one-time and ongoing costs, including costs of operating as independent companies, that the separated businesses will no longer be able to share. In addition, until the market has fully analyzed the values of the separate companies, the price of our common stock and common stock of the new company may experience volatility. Our common stock or the common stock of the new company may not match some holders’ investment strategies or meet minimum criteria for inclusion in stock market indices or portfolios, which could cause certain investors to sell their shares, which could in turn lead to declines in the trading price of such stock. As a result of any of the foregoing or other risks, the combined value of the common stock of the two publicly traded companies may be less than what the value of our common stock would have been absent the spinoff. We may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the Hillrom acquisition.During 2021, we completed the acquisition of Hillrom. The success of this acquisition depends on, among other things, our ability to integrate Hillrom in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities, realizes anticipated cost and revenue synergies (some of which are still being identified) and achieves certain previously communicated net 11leverage targets without adversely affecting current revenues and investments in future growth. If we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the Hillrom acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.There is a significant degree of difficulty and management distraction inherent in the process of integrating an acquisition. These difficulties include challenges consolidating certain operations and functions (including regulatory and other corporate functions), integrating technologies (including differing IT systems and processes), organizations, procedures, policies and operations, addressing differences in the business cultures of the two companies and retaining key personnel. The integration is complex and time consuming and aspects of it may be delayed, or additional and unforeseen expenses may result, in light of our recently announced strategic initiatives. The integration process and other disruptions resulting from the Hillrom acquisition may also disrupt our ongoing businesses or cause inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our relationships with market participants, employees, regulators and others with whom we have business or other dealings. Any failure to successfully or cost-effectively integrate Hillrom could have a material adverse effect on our business and cause reputational harm. Challenges associated with our integration efforts are heightened due to the other strategic actions we are pursuing.If our business strategy and development activities are unsuccessful, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.While we remain committed to deleveraging, we expect to engage in significant business development activities over the longer term (once we have satisfied our net leverage targets), including evaluating acquisitions, joint development opportunities, technology licensing arrangements and other opportunities. These activities may result in substantial investment of our resources (including resources currently focused on the recently announced strategic initiatives discussed above). Our success developing products or expanding into new markets from such activities will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to find suitable opportunities for acquisition, investment or alliance; competition from other companies in the industries in which we operate that are seeking similar opportunities; whether we are able to complete an acquisition, investment or alliance on terms that are satisfactory to us; the strength of the other company’s underlying technology, products and ability to execute its business strategies; any intellectual property and litigation related to the other company’s products or technology; and our ability to successfully integrate the acquired company, business, product, technology or research into our existing operations, including the ability to adequately fund acquired in-process R&D projects and to maintain adequate controls over the combined operations. Certain of these activities are subject to antitrust and competition laws, which laws could impact our ability to pursue strategic transactions and could result in mandated divestitures in the context of proposed acquisitions. If we are unsuccessful in our business development activities, we may not realize the intended benefits of such activities, including that acquisition and integration costs may be greater than expected or the possibility that expected return on investment, synergies and accretion will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected timeframes. For more information, see Note 2 in Item 8 of this Annual Report.Risks Related to Our Financial Performance and Our Common StockGlobal economic conditions, including inflation and supply chain disruptions, have adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, our operations.General global economic downturns and macroeconomic trends, including heightened inflation, capital markets volatility, interest rate and currency rate fluctuations, and economic slowdown or recession, have resulted and may continue to result in unfavorable conditions that negatively affect demand for our products and exacerbate some of the other risks that affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Both domestic and international markets experienced significant inflationary pressures in fiscal year 2022 and inflation rates in the U.S., as well as in other countries in which we operate, are currently expected to continue at elevated levels for the near-term. In addition, the Federal Reserve in the U.S. and other central banks in various countries have raised, and may again raise, interest rates in response to concerns about inflation, which, coupled with reduced government spending and volatility in financial markets, has had and may continue to have the effect of further increasing economic uncertainty and heightening these risks. Interest rate increases or other government actions taken to reduce inflation have resulted in recessionary pressures in many parts of the world. Furthermore, currency exchange rates have been especially volatile in the recent past, and these currency fluctuations have affected, and may continue to affect, the reported value of our assets and liabilities, as well as our cash flows.We have experienced significant challenges to our global supply chain in recent periods, including production delays and interruptions, increased costs and shortages of raw materials and component parts (including resins and electromechanical devices) and higher transportation and labor costs, resulting from COVID-19 and other 12exogenous factors including significant weather events, elevated inflation levels, disruptions to certain ports of call around the world, the war in Ukraine and other geopolitical events. Due to the nature of our products, which include dense consumable medical products such as IV fluids, and the geographic locations of our manufacturing facilities, which often require us to transport our products long distances, we may be more susceptible to increases in freight costs and other supply chain challenges than certain of our industry peers. We expect to experience some of these and other challenges related to our supply chain in future periods. These challenges, including the unavailability of certain raw materials and component parts, have also had a negative impact on our sales for certain product categories due to our inability to fully satisfy demand and may continue to have a negative impact on our sales in the future.  They have also made it increasingly difficult to model accurately our short-term and long-term financial objectives and may continue to do so in the futureOur ability to generate cash flows from operations has been affected, and could continue to be affected, if there is a material decline in the demand for our products or, in the solvency or planned capital expenditures of our customers or suppliers, or if there is deterioration in our key financial ratios or credit ratings. Current or worsening economic conditions may impact the ability of our customers (including governments) to pay for our products and services and the amount spent on healthcare generally, which could result in decreased demand for our products and services, declining cash flows, longer sales cycles, increased inventory levels, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. These conditions may also adversely affect certain of our suppliers, which could disrupt our ability to produce products. We continue to do business with foreign governments in certain countries, including Greece and Italy, which have experienced deterioration in credit and economic conditions. While global economic conditions have not significantly impacted our ability to collect receivables, liquidity issues in certain countries have resulted, and may continue to result, in delays in the collection of receivables and credit losses, and may also impact the stability of the U.S. dollar, Euro or Yuan.Our operating results and financial condition may fluctuate.Our operating results and financial condition may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year for a number of reasons. Events, such as changes to our expectations, strategy or forecasts (including as a result of evolving global macroeconomic conditions and updated expectations regarding the timing of new regulatory approvals) or even a relatively small revenue shortfall or increase in supply chain or other costs which we are unable to offset may cause financial results for a period to be below our expectations or projections. As a result, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful, nor should they be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our operating results and financial condition are also subject to fluctuation from all of the risks described throughout this section. These fluctuations may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and our stock price.We may not achieve our financial goals.We continue to evaluate and refine both our short-term and long-term financial objectives, including our stated commitment to achieve certain net leverage targets. Our ability to achieve these targets depends, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition (and related cost and revenue synergy targets) while working to execute on our stated portfolio management and other recently announced strategic initiatives. We may fail to achieve our targeted financial results if we are unsuccessful in implementing our strategies, our estimates or assumptions change or for any other reason. Our failure to achieve our financial goals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We have incurred a substantial amount of debt in connection with the Hillrom acquisition, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.We incurred acquisition-related debt financing of approximately $11.8 billion to fund the cash consideration for the Hillrom acquisition, refinance certain indebtedness of Hillrom and pay related fees and expenses. Our substantially increased indebtedness and higher debt-to-equity ratio following the acquisition has the effect, among other things, of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and has increased our borrowing costs (including as a result of the downgrade in our senior debt credit ratings in 2021). The increased levels of indebtedness and our recent projected financial performance could also reduce funds available (under our credit facilities or otherwise) for investments in product development, capital expenditures, dividend payments, acquisitions, share repurchases and other activities and may create competitive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels. In addition, until we achieve our commitment to reduce our indebtedness following the Hillrom acquisition, our capital allocation activities and operational flexibility is limited. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in doing so on a timely basis or at all.13Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and liquidity.We generate the majority of our revenue and profit outside the United States. As a result, our financial results have been and may in the future be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or our ability to mitigate these risks. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, additional volatility as a result of inflation and other macroeconomic factors, including in emerging market countries. We are also exposed to changes in interest rates, and our ability to access the money markets and capital markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all, could be impeded if market conditions are not favorable. For more information see “Financial Instrument Market Risk” in Item 7 of this Annual Report.Our common stock price has fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future. The price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to:•market perceptions of any strategic actions or other developments related to our business we announce, including, for example, our announcement regarding the proposed spinoff of our Renal Care and Acute Therapies product categories;•variations in our net sales, earnings or other financial results from investors’ expectations or our previously issued guidance;•departure of key personnel;•fluctuations in the results of our operations and general conditions in the economy, our market, and the markets served by our customers; and•the operating and stock performance of comparable companies or related industries.In addition, prices in the stock market have generally been volatile over the past few years. In certain cases, the fluctuations have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies. As a result, the price of our common stock could also fluctuate in the future without regard to our operating performance.Future material impairments in the value of our long-lived assets, including goodwill, could negatively affect our operating results.We regularly review our long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets, goodwill (which results from our acquisition activity) and property, plant and equipment, for impairment. Goodwill and acquired indefinite life intangible assets are subject to impairment review on an annual basis and whenever potential impairment indicators are present. Other long-lived assets are reviewed when there is an indication that impairment may have occurred. Changes in market conditions or other changes in the future outlook of value may lead to impairment charges in the future. In addition, we may from time to time sell assets that we determine are not critical to our strategy, including in connection with strategic exits. Future events or decisions may lead to asset impairments and/or related charges. Certain non-cash impairments may result from a change in our strategic goals, business direction or other factors relating to the overall business environment. Material impairment charges could negatively affect our results of operations. For example, in the third quarter of 2022, we recorded a $2.8 billion goodwill impairment relating to our three Hillrom reporting units due to macroeconomic conditions, including the rising interest rate environment and broad declines in equity valuations, and reduced earnings forecasts for these units, driven primarily by shortages of certain component parts used in our products, raw materials inflation and increased supply chain costs. Further adverse changes to macroeconomic conditions or our earnings forecasts could lead to additional goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges in future periods and such charges could be material to our results of operations. For more information on the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, see “Critical Accounting Policies” in Item 7 of this Annual Report.Other Risks Relating to Our BusinessThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have had, and we expect will continue to have, a material adverse effect on our business. The nature and extent of future impacts are uncertain and unpredictable.Our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises, including epidemics and pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 has had, and we expect will continue to have, an adverse impact on 14our operations, supply chains and distribution systems and has increased and will continue to increase our expenses, including due to preventive and precautionary measures that we, other businesses and governments have taken and may continue to take. COVID-19 has adversely affected and many continue to adversely affect our business in many ways, including, but not limited to, the following:•We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, significant and unpredictable reductions or increases in demand for certain of our products as healthcare customers re-prioritize the treatment of patients. Some of our products are particularly sensitive to reductions in elective medical procedures. For example, due to the spread of the Omicron variant in 2022, many elective procedures were suspended or postponed in our principal markets as hospital systems prioritized treatment of COVID-19 patients again or otherwise comply with changing government guidelines. Further delays or cancellations may occur in the future. While we have started to see a resurgence in the scheduling of elective procedures in at least some of the markets in which we operate, if patients and hospital systems de-prioritize, delay or cancel elective procedures in the future, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be negatively affected.  Additionally, through the pandemic, certain portions of our patient populations (including End Stage Renal Disease patients) have experienced heightened mortality levels. Demand for related products and services may not rebound to pre-pandemic levels in light of these increased mortality rates.•A significant number of our suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and vendors have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, including obstacles relating to their ability to maintain the continuity of their on-site operations. These impacts have caused interruptions and delays in our supply chain, and may continue to do so, resulting in more expensive alternative sources of labor and materials and heightened supply chain costs. Any delay or shortage in the supply of components or materials or other operational or logistical challenges impacts our ability to satisfy consumer demand for our products in a timely manner or at all, which could harm our reputation, future sales and profitability. For example, we have experienced supply constraints for amino acid raw materials used in our parenteral nutrition products, as such materials are being used to produce COVID-19 vaccines. These constraints have resulted in certain product backorders and may do so in the future.•We could experience a loss of sales and profitability due to delayed payments, reduced demand or capital constraints of healthcare professionals, hospitals and other customers (including potential insolvency) and suppliers and vendors facing liquidity or other financial issues. These liquidity or other financial issues could be exacerbated if prolonged high levels of unemployment or loss of insurance coverage impact patients’ ability to access treatments that use our products and services. •COVID-19 has adversely impacted the continued service and availability of skilled personnel necessary to run our operations. For example, we have faced increased absenteeism in connection with the rise of various COVID-19 variants. Although we have sought to mitigate these staffing challenges through overtime and enlisting contingent labor, staffing shortages have strained our operations and increased our expenses. •We face increased operational challenges as we continue to take measures to support and protect employee health and safety, including through work from home policies. While many of our employees have returned to work, remote or hybrid working arrangements heighten our risks associated with information technology systems and networks, including cyber-attacks, computer viruses, malicious software, security breaches, and telecommunication failures, both for systems and networks we control directly and for those that employees and third-party developers rely on to work remotely. Any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches or cyber risks or detect, or respond adequately to, a security breach or cyber risk, or any other disruptions to our information technology systems and networks (as a result of remote working arrangements or otherwise), can have adverse effects on our business and cause reputational and financial harm. Any of these and other impacts of the pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the scope and duration of any future public health crisis will depend on a number of factors, including the potential emergence of new variants, the pace at which government restrictions are imposed and lifted and the extent of such restrictions, the scope of additional actions taken to mitigate the spread of disease, the availability, effectiveness and acceptance of vaccines and the speed and extent to which global markets and utilization rates for our products fully recover from the disruptions caused by such a public health crisis. The impact of these and other factors on our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. Finally, to the extent COVID-19 or any future public health 15crisis adversely affects our operations and global economic conditions more generally, many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors
” section may be heightened.If we are unable to successfully introduce new products or fail to keep pace with changing consumer preferences and needs and advances in technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.We need to successfully introduce new products to achieve our strategic business objectives. We can provide no assurances that our new products will achieve commercial acceptance in the marketplace. In addition, difficulties in manufacturing or in obtaining regulatory approvals, have delayed and may in the future delay or prohibit introduction of new products into the marketplace. We may not be able to obtain patent protection on our new products or be able to defend our intellectual property rights globally. Warranty claims and service costs relating to our new products might be greater than anticipated, and we might be required to devote significant resources to address any quality issues associated with our new products, which could reduce the resources available for further new product development and other matters. In addition, the introduction of new products might also cause customers to defer purchases of existing products. Our future financial performance will also depend in part on our ability to influence, anticipate, identify and respond to changing consumer preferences and needs. We might not correctly anticipate or identify trends in customer preferences or needs or might identify them later than competitors do.Failure to successfully introduce new products in a cost-effective manner, or delays in customer purchasing decisions related to the evaluation of new products, could cause us to lose market share and could materially adversely affect our business. Furthermore, product development requires substantial investment and there is inherent risk in the R&D process. A successful product development process further depends on many other factors, including our ability to adapt to new technologies, demonstrate satisfactory clinical results and differentiate our products from those of our competitors. If we cannot successfully introduce new competitive products or adapt to changing technologies, our products may become obsolete and our revenue and profitability could suffer. Issues with product supply or quality could have an adverse effect on our business or cause a loss of customer confidence in us or our products, among other negative consequences.Our success depends upon the availability and quality of our products and the underlying raw materials and component parts. The medical products and pharmaceutical industries are competitive and subject to complex market dynamics and varying demand levels. These levels vary in response to economic conditions, regulatory requirements, seasonality, natural disasters, pandemics, epidemics and other matters. For example, for many of our suppliers, the COVID-19 pandemic created obstacles relating to their ability to maintain the continuity of their on-site operations. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, increases in the cost of certain raw materials and component parts and have incurred, and may continue to incur, increased freight costs as a result of, among other things, rising and high levels of inflation, increased energy and transportation prices as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict and other obstacles due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These obstacles may prevent suppliers from providing goods and services to us on reasonable terms or at all.Additionally, the development of new or enhanced products involves a lengthy regulatory process and is capital intensive. As a result, our ability to match our production levels and capacity to market demand is imprecise and may result in a failure to meet market demand or satisfy customer requirements for our products or, alternatively, an oversupply of inventory. Increased costs relating to freight, raw materials or component parts and difficulties hiring and retaining staff have had and may continue to have a negative impact on product supply. Failure to meet market demand may result in customers transitioning to available competitive products, loss of market share, negative publicity, reputational damage, loss of customer confidence or other negative consequences (including a decline in stock price). Our success also depends on our ability to maintain and routinely improve product quality and our quality management program. Quality management plays an essential role in meeting customer requirements, preventing defects, improving our products and services and assuring the safety and efficacy of our products. While we have a quality system that covers the lifecycle of our products, quality and safety issues have and may in the future occur with respect to our products. New or unintended uses of our products (for example, in response to changing clinical practice) may also raise quality or safety issues. A quality or safety issue may result in adverse inspection reports, voluntary or official action indicated, warning letters, import bans, product recalls (either voluntary or required by FDA or similar governmental authorities in other countries) or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions (which may include corporate integrity agreements), costly litigation, refusal of a government to grant approvals and licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. See “-Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters.” An inability to 16address a quality or safety issue in an effective and timely manner may also cause negative publicity, a loss of customer confidence in us or our current or future products, which may result in the loss of sales and difficulty in successfully launching new products. Additionally, we have made and continue to make significant investments in assets, including inventory and property, plant and equipment, which relate to potential new products or modifications to existing products. Product quality or safety issues may restrict us from being able to realize the expected returns from these investments, potentially resulting in asset impairments in the future.Unaffiliated third-party suppliers provide a number of goods and services to our R&D, clinical and manufacturing organizations, many of whom do so on a spot basis and not pursuant to a contractual arrangement. Our ability to receive goods or services at all or on reasonable financial terms from these third parties will be impacted if they are unable or refuse to supply or service us. Moreover, we may have limited or no recourse if the goods or services are not subject to contractual terms. If we are unable to identify or secure regulatory approval for an alternative provider on reasonable terms, our ability to meet our obligations to our customers could be negatively impacted, which could adversely affect our financial results and our reputation. Additionally, third party suppliers are required to comply with our quality standards (and those of applicable regulatory bodies). Failure of a third-party supplier to provide compliant raw materials, component parts or supplies (or to help us secure all required regulatory approvals for the use of their products or services) has resulted in delays and service interruptions and may do so in the future or cause quality related issues that may negatively impact our business results.There is substantial competition in the product markets in which we operate and the risk of declining demand and pricing pressures could adversely affect our operating results.Although no single company competes with us in all of our businesses, we face substantial competition in all of our markets from international and domestic healthcare medical products and pharmaceutical companies and providers of all sizes, and these competitors often differ across our businesses. Competition is primarily focused on cost-effectiveness, price, service, product performance and technological innovation.Competition may increase further as additional companies begin to enter our markets or modify their existing products to compete directly with ours. If our competitors respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or we do not introduce new versions or upgrades to our product portfolio in response to those requirements, our products may be rendered obsolete or non-competitive. If our competitors develop more effective or affordable products or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than we do, our business, financial condition and operations will likely be negatively affected. If we are forced to reduce our prices due to increased competition, our business could become less profitable. In addition, many healthcare industry companies, including healthcare systems, distributors, manufacturers, providers, and insurers, are consolidating or have formed strategic alliances. As the healthcare industry consolidates, competition to provide goods and services to industry participants will become more intense. Further, this consolidation creates larger enterprises with greater negotiating power, which they can use to negotiate price concessions. If we face an increase in costs or must reduce (or are unable to successfully increase) our prices because of industry consolidation. the long-term nature of our customer contracts or for other reasons, or if we lose customers as a result of consolidation, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Demand for our products and services depends in large part on overall demand in the healthcare market. With the healthcare market’s increased focus on hospital asset and resource efficiency as well as reimbursement constraints, we have seen spending for some of our products decline recently and it may continue to do so over time. Further, the competitive pressures in our industry could cause us to lose market share unless we increase our commercial investments or reduce our prices, which could adversely impact our operating results. These factors, along with possible legislative, regulatory and other developments, might result in significant shifts in market share among the industry’s major participants, which includes us. Accordingly, if we are unable to effectively differentiate ourselves from our competitors in terms of new products and diversification of our product portfolio, then our market share, sales and profitability could be adversely impacted through lower volume or decreased prices.If we fail to attract and retain key employees our business may suffer.Our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees, including people in senior management, sales, marketing, information technology and R&D positions and from the recently acquired Hillrom business. Competition for top talent in the healthcare industry can be intense. Our ability to recruit and retain such talent will depend on a number of factors, including hiring practices of our competitors, compensation and benefits (as may be impacted by any financial performance challenges), work location, work environment (including our competitors’ policies regarding remote or hybrid work arrangements, the market’s perception of our recently 17announced strategic initiatives and industry economic conditions. If we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified employees, our business could suffer.Risks Related to Our Business Operations Segments of our business are significantly dependent on major contracts with GPOs, IDNs, and certain other distributors and purchasers.A portion of our U.S. hospital sales and rentals are made pursuant to contracts with hospital GPOs. At any given time, we are typically at various stages of responding to bids, negotiating and renewing expiring GPO agreements. Failure to be included in certain of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business, including product sales and service and rental revenue. In addition, we have faced and continue to face challenges related to increasing costs associated with these agreements (associated with ongoing supply chain challenges and inflation), which have negatively impacted our revenues and may continue to do so in the future.Our participation in such programs often requires increased discounting or restrictions on our ability to raise prices, and failure to participate or to be selected for participation in such programs might result in a reduction of sales to the member hospitals. In addition, the industry is showing an increased focus on contracting directly with health systems or IDNs (which typically represent influential members and owners of GPOs). IDNs and health systems often make key purchasing decisions and have influence over the GPO’s contract decisions, and often request additional discounts or other enhancements. Further, certain other distributors and purchasers have similar processes to the GPOs and IDNs and failure to be included in agreements with these other purchasers could have a material adverse effect on our business.We may not be successful in achieving expected operating efficiencies and sustaining or improving operating expense reductions, and might experience business disruptions and adverse tax consequences associated with restructuring, realignment and cost reduction activities.Portions of our business have been, and may in the future be, the subject of restructuring, realignment and cost reduction initiatives. For example, we continue to work to successfully integrate Hillrom into our operations and we recently announced our plans to implement a simplified operating model and manufacturing footprint. While we initiate these actions with the goal of realizing efficiencies, we may not be successful in achieving the full efficiencies and cost reduction benefits we expect. Further, such benefits might be realized later than expected, and the ongoing costs of implementing these measures might be greater than anticipated. If these measures are not successful or sustainable, we might undertake additional realignment and cost reduction efforts, which could result in future charges. Moreover, our ability to achieve our other strategic goals and business plans might be adversely affected, and we could experience business disruptions, if our restructuring and realignment efforts and our cost reduction activities prove ineffective. These actions, the resulting costs, and potential delays or potential lower than anticipated benefits might also impact our foreign tax positions and might require us to record tax reserves against certain deferred tax assets in our international business.If we are unable to obtain sufficient components or raw materials on a timely basis or for a cost-effective price or if we experience other manufacturing, sterilization, supply or distribution difficulties, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.The manufacture of our products requires, among other things, the timely supply or delivery of sufficient amounts of quality components and materials. We manufacture our products in approximately 60 principal manufacturing locations. We acquire our components, materials and other requirements for manufacturing from many suppliers and vendors in various countries, including sometimes from ourselves for self-supplied requirements. We endeavor, either alone or working closely with our suppliers, to ensure the continuity of our inputs and supplies but we cannot guarantee these efforts will always be successful. Further, while efforts are made to diversify certain of our sources of components and materials, in certain instances there is only a sole source or supplier with no alternatives yet identified. Additionally, we obtain certain components and materials on a spot basis from third party suppliers with whom we do not have a contractual arrangement. For most of our components and materials for which a single source or supplier is used, alternative sources or suppliers may exist, but we have made a strategic determination to use the single source or supplier. Although we do carry strategic inventory and maintain insurance to help mitigate the potential risk related to supply disruption, such measures may not be sufficient or effective. A reduction, interruption or suspension in supply, other supply chain issues, including those due to the revocation of distribution facilities’ licenses or as a result of our recently announced strategic initiatives, and our inability to quickly develop acceptable alternative sources for such supply could adversely affect our ability to manufacture, distribute and sell our products in a timely or cost-effective manner. We have faced difficulties obtaining supplies of key materials such 18as electromechanical components, active ingredients for pharmaceuticals and resins due to supply chain disruptions and the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, changes in regulation, world trade policies, international taxes and government-to-government relations and issues with export and import activities could negatively impact our ability to distribute products within a country and across countries. See “-Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters.” Additionally, volatility in our costs of energy, transportation/freight, components, raw materials and other supply, manufacturing and distribution costs have had and could in the future adversely affect our results of operations. These prices might continue to fluctuate based on many factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to, changes in general economic conditions (including inflation), political unrest, labor costs, delivery costs, competition and currency exchange rates.Significant increases in the cost of raw materials, sub-assemblies or materials used in the production of our products that cannot be recovered through increased prices of our products (or the unavailability of those raw materials, sub-assemblies or production materials) have adversely affect our results of operations and may continue to do so in the future. There can be no assurance that the marketplace will support higher prices or that such prices and productivity gains will fully offset any commodity cost increases in the future. We may from time to time engage in hedging transactions with respect to raw material purchases but do enter into fixed price supply contracts at times. Future decisions not to engage in hedging transactions or ineffective hedging transactions might result in increased cost volatility, potentially adversely impacting our profitability.Many of our products are difficult to manufacture. This is due to the complex nature of manufacturing devices and pharmaceuticals, including biologics, as well as the strict regulatory regime governing our manufacturing operations. Variations in the manufacturing process may result in production failures which could lead to launch delays, product shortage, unanticipated costs, lost revenues and damage to our reputation. A failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers may also result in a quality or safety issue of the type discussed above.Some of our products are manufactured at a single manufacturing facility or stored at a single storage site. Additionally, some of our manufacturing facilities are located in the same geographic area. Loss or damage to, or closure of, a manufacturing facility or storage site due to a natural disaster, such as we experienced as a result of Hurricane Maria, a pandemic, such as COVID-19, or otherwise could adversely affect our ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of key products or deliver products to meet customer demand or contractual requirements, which may result in a loss of revenue and other adverse business consequences (including those identified in the paragraphs above). We might be unable to transfer manufacturing of the relevant products to another facility or location in a cost-effective or timely manner, if at all. This potential inability to transfer production could occur for several reasons, including but not limited to a lack of necessary relevant manufacturing capability at another facility, or the regulatory requirements of the FDA or other governmental regulatory bodies. Such an event could materially negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, several of our manufacturing facilities are leased and we may not be able to renew leases on favorable terms or at all. Because of the time required to approve and license a manufacturing facility, a third-party manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis (if at all) to replace production capacity in the event we lose manufacturing capacity or products are otherwise unavailable. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Some of our products require sterilization prior to sale or distribution, and we utilize both Baxter-owned and third-party facilities for this process. If an event occurs that results in damage to or closure, whether temporarily or permanent, of one or more of these facilities, we may be unable to manufacture or sterilize the relevant products at prior levels or at all, and a third party may not be available on a timely basis (if at all) to replace sterilization capacity. For example, in 2021, our facility in Mountain Home, Arkansas, entered into a Consent Administrative Order with the Arkansas Division of Environmental Quality relating to certain air emission control technology used to reduce ethylene oxide-emissions from sterilization equipment. Although the events giving rise to the Consent Administrative Order only caused a temporary pause in operations, these events or other disruptions of manufacturing or sterilization processes that we or third parties may experience, whether due to lack of capacity, environmental, regulatory or compliance issues or otherwise, could result in product shortage, unanticipated costs, loss of revenues, litigation and damage to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 19Climate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.The long-term effects of climate change are difficult to predict and may be widespread. The impacts of climate change may include physical risks (e.g., rising sea levels or frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions, including natural disasters), social and human effects (e.g., population dislocations or harm to health and well-being), compliance costs and transition risks (e.g., regulatory or technology changes), shifts in market trends (e.g., customers increasingly prioritize purchasing products that are sustainably made) and other adverse effects. Such impacts (including as a result of Hurricane Maria) have disrupted and may continue to disrupt our supply chain and operations by adversely affecting our ability to procure goods or services required for the operation of our business at the quantities and levels we require, due to impairment of the availability and cost of certain products, materials, commodities and energy. For example, material or sustained increases in the price of oil have had an adverse impact on the cost of many of the plastic materials or resins we use to make and package our products, as well as our transportation/freight costs. These outcomes may in turn result in customers transitioning to available competitive products, loss of market share, negative publicity, reputational damage, loss of customer confidence or other negative consequences (including a decline in stock price).In addition, the increasing concern over climate change has resulted and may continue to result in more regional, federal, and/or global legal and regulatory requirements relating to climate change, including regulating greenhouse gas emissions (and the establishment of enhanced internal processes or systems to track them), alternative energy policies and sustainability initiatives. If legislation or regulations are enacted or promulgated in the United States or in any other jurisdictions in which we do business that impose more stringent restrictions and requirements than our current legal or regulatory obligations, we may experience disruptions in, or increases in the costs associated with, sourcing, manufacturing and distributing our products. Additionally, rising climate change concerns have led to and could continue to lead to additional regulation that could increase our compliance costs. As a result, any such regulatory changes could have a significant effect on our business, financial condition or result of operations. Breaches and breakdowns affecting our information technology systems or protected information, including from cyber security breaches and data leakage, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, reputation and competitive position.We rely upon information technology systems and infrastructure, including services provided by our partners and third parties, to support our business, products and customers. For example, we routinely rely on technology systems and infrastructure in the collection, use, storage and transfer, disclosure and other processing of voluminous amounts of protected information including personal data (of patients, employees, customers, third parties), confidential, business, financial, personal and other sensitive information (collectively, Protected Information). We also rely on systems for manufacturing, customer orders, shipping, regulatory compliance and various other matters. Certain of our products and systems collect Protected Information regarding patients and their therapy and some are internet enabled or connect to our systems for maintenance and other purposes. The acquisition of Hillrom in December 2021 increased the number of these products and systems within our portfolio. Some of our products, even though not internet enabled nor connected to our systems, connect to hospital networks, electronic medical records or electronic health records. The continuing evolution of technology we use, including cloud-based computing and data hosting, and reliance on third parties creates additional opportunities for the unintentional, intentional, unauthorized or unlawful disclosure, exposure, dissemination, loss, alteration, access or destruction of Protected Information stored or processed in our devices, systems, servers, infrastructure and products (collectively, Technology). Security threats, including cyber and other attacks, have become very sophisticated, frequent and adaptive.Our Technology is vulnerable to breakdown, interruption, cyber and other security attacks, system malfunction, unauthorized access, inadvertent exposure or disclosure of information, theft and other events. Third-party systems that we rely upon could also become vulnerable to the same risks and may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could result in system disruption or compromise the information security of our own systems. Any such vulnerability could compromise our Technology and could expose Protected Information to unauthorized third parties and/or cause temporary or permanent loss or unavailability of such Protected Information. In addition, our Technology may cause product functionality issues that could result in risk to patient safety, field actions and/or product recalls. We have, like other large multi-national companies, experienced cyber incidents in the past and may experience them in the future, which have exposed and may continue to expose vulnerabilities in our information technology systems. Although the prior incidents have not had a material effect on our business and we have invested and continue to invest in the protection of data and Technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts have prevented or will prevent future breakdowns, attacks, breaches in our Technology, cyber incidents or other incidents or ensure compliance with all applicable security and privacy laws, regulations and standards, 20including with respect to third-party service providers that host or process Protected Information on our behalf. Any failure to protect against such incidents can lead to substantial and material regulatory fines and penalties, business disruption, reputational harm, financial loss, litigation as well as other damages. Misappropriation or other loss of our intellectual property from any of the foregoing may have an adverse effect on our competitive position and may cause us to incur substantial litigation costs. See “-Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters.” As the FDA, other regulators, including data protection authorities, and our customers become more sensitive to risks related to cybersecurity, our ability to meet certain information technology safety standards could affect our products’ marketability and competitiveness. We could also suffer strained relationships with customers, business partners, physicians and other healthcare professionals, increased costs (for security measures, remediation or otherwise), litigation (including class actions and stockholder derivative actions) or other negative consequences (including a decline in stock price) from breaches, cyber and other security attacks, industrial espionage, ransomware, email or phishing scams, malware or other cyber incidents, which may compromise our system infrastructure or lead to data leakage, either internally or at our third-party providers or other business partners.In addition, significant implementation issues may arise as we continue to consolidate and outsource certain computer operations and application support activities (including as a result of our ongoing business transformation activities and in connection with the Hillrom integration and our recently announced strategic initiatives). Further, a number of our employees have hybrid work arrangements, which (among other things) exposes us to heightened risks related to our information technology systems and networks, including cyber-attacks, computer viruses, malicious software, security breaches, and telecommunication failures, both for systems and networks we control directly and for those that employees and third-party developers rely on to work remotely. We also face all of the same risks listed above and other heightened risks when acquiring a company, in particular if we need to transition or implement certain processes or controls with the acquired company. For example, as we continue to integrate Hillrom into our business, we have identified certain potential areas of vulnerability as we transition its information technology systems, products and processes to our processes and controls, including with respect to cybersecurity and privacy matters. While we working to fully address those vulnerabilities (consistent with our processes and controls) we do not believe any of them present any material risks to our business or operations (including with respect to our Technology). Any such vulnerabilities (or any others) if unidentified or unremediated could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We are subject to risks associated with doing business globally.Our operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business globally and under the laws, regulations and customs of various jurisdictions and geographies. These risks include changes in exchange controls and other governmental actions, loss of business in government and public tenders that are held annually in many cases, increasingly complex labor environments, availability of raw materials and component parts, changes in taxation, tariffs, export control restrictions, changes in or violations of U.S. or local laws, dependence on a few government entities as customers, pricing restrictions, economic and political instability, monetary or currency volatility or instability (including as it relates to the U.S. dollar, the Euro, the Yuan and currencies in emerging market countries (including the Turkish Lira)), disputes between countries, trade relationships and conflicts, diminished or insufficient protection of intellectual property, and disruption or destruction of operations in a significant geographic region regardless of cause, including natural disaster, pandemic, power loss, cyber-attack, data breach, war, terrorism, riot, labor disruption, civil insurrection or social unrest. Failure to comply with, or material changes to, the laws and regulations that affect our global operations could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.The escalating global economic competition and trade tensions between the U.S., China and Russia could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Although we have been able to mitigate some of the impact from increased duties imposed by these countries (through petitioning the governments for tariff exclusions and other mitigations), the risk remains of additional tariffs and other kinds of restrictions. Tariff exclusions awarded to us by the U.S. Government require annual renewal, and policies for granting exclusions could shift. The U.S., China and Russia could impose other types of restrictions such as limitations on government procurement or technology export restrictions, which could affect our access to the markets. More generally, several governments have raised the possibility of policies to induce “re-shoring” of supply chains, less reliance on imported supplies and greater national production. For example, the Chinese government has issued a series of policies in the past several years to promote local medical devices or suggest government procurement budgets for local products. Another example would be the stronger “Buy American” requirements in the U.S. (pursuant to a U.S. executive order by the Administration on January 25, 2021) or the potential U.S. withdrawal from the World Trade Organization Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA). If such steps triggered retaliation in other markets, such as by restricting access to foreign products in purchases by their government-21owned healthcare systems the outcomes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.A portion of our workforce is unionized, and we could face labor disruptions that would interfere with our operations.Some of our employees both in and outside of the United States (including contingent workers) work under collective bargaining agreements or national trade union agreements or are subject to works councils. Although we have not recently experienced any significant work stoppages as a result of labor disagreements, we cannot ensure that such a stoppage will not occur in the future. Two collective bargaining agreements for one of our U.S. manufacturing facilities are scheduled to expire in January 2024 and January 2025, respectively. Our inability to negotiate satisfactory new agreements or a labor disturbance at any of our manufacturing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our operations.Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory MattersWe are subject to a number of laws and regulations, non-compliance with which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and we are susceptible to a changing regulatory environment.As a participant in the healthcare industry, our operations and products, and those of our customers, are regulated by numerous government agencies, both inside and outside the United States. Laws and regulations include the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act (H.R. 3590) and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (H.R. 4872) (collectively, the Healthcare Reform Act) which aim to decrease costs through comparative effectiveness research and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies. Compliance with these and similar regulations could result in pricing pressure or negatively impact the demand for our products. In a number of situations, even though specific laws and regulations may not directly apply to us, our products must be capable of being used by our customers in a manner that complies with those laws and regulations.The manufacture, distribution, marketing and use of our products are subject to extensive regulation and scrutiny by FDA and other regulatory authorities globally. Any new product must undergo lengthy and rigorous testing and other extensive, costly and time-consuming procedures mandated by FDA and foreign regulatory authorities. The same testing and procedures sometimes apply to current products that are up for authorization or renewal or are subject to changes in laws or regulations. For example, our medical devices that are being sold or distributed in the European Union have to comply with the European Union Medical Device Regulation that entered into force in May 2021. This Medical Device Regulation currently provides a phase in period for manufacturers to comply with related regulations through May 2024. These regulations require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in EU member states to meet certain quality system and safety requirements and ongoing product monitoring responsibilities, and obtain a “CE” marking (i.e., a mandatory conformity marking for certain products sold within the European Economic Area) for their products. Various penalties exist for non-compliance with the laws implementing the European Medical Device Regulations which, if incurred, could have a material adverse impact on portions of our business, results of operations and cash flows. Changes to current products may be subject to vigorous review, including additional FDA 510(k) and other regulatory submissions, and approvals or the time needed to secure approvals are not certain. Our facilities must be approved and licensed prior to production and remain subject to inspection from time to time thereafter. Failure to comply with the requirements of FDA or other regulatory authorities, including a failed inspection or a failure in our adverse event reporting system, has resulted and could result in adverse inspection reports, voluntary or official action indicated, warning letters, import bans, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, reputational damage, injunctions to halt the manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a government to grant approvals or licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. The failure of our suppliers to comply with regulations could also adversely affect segments of our business as regulatory actions taken by FDA against those manufacturers can result in product shortages, recalls or modifications. Any of these actions could cause a loss of customer confidence in us and our products, which could adversely affect our sales. Our business is also subject to risks associated with U.S. and foreign legislation, regulations and trade agreements relating to the materials we import, including quotas, duties, tariffs or taxes, other charges or restrictions on imports and the nature of materials that can be used in our products, which could adversely affect our operations and our ability to import materials used in our products at current or increased levels. We cannot predict whether additional U.S. and foreign customs quotas, duties (including antidumping or countervailing duties), tariffs, taxes or other charges or restrictions, requirements as to where raw materials and component parts must be purchased, additional 22workplace regulations or other restrictions on our imports will be imposed in the future or adversely modified, or what effect such actions would have on our costs of operations. Future quotas, duties or tariffs may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Future trade agreements could also provide our competitors with an advantage over us, or increase our costs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.The sales, marketing and pricing of products and relationships that medical device and pharmaceutical companies have with healthcare providers are under increased scrutiny by federal, state and foreign government agencies. Compliance with the Anti-Kickback Statute, False Claims Act, Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (including as these laws relate to off-label promotion of products) and other healthcare related laws, as well as competition and export and import laws, is under increased focus by the agencies charged with overseeing such activities. The DOJ and the SEC are focused on the enforcement of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), particularly as it relates to the conduct of medical product and pharmaceutical companies. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their employees, contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Healthcare professionals in many countries are employed by the government and consequently may be considered government officials. Foreign governments are also focused on examining medical product and pharmaceutical companies’ sales and marketing activities and relationships with healthcare providers and competitive practices generally. The laws and standards governing the promotion, pricing, sale and reimbursement of our products and those governing our relationships with healthcare providers and governments, including the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, are complicated, are subject to frequent change and may be violated unknowingly.We are also subject to environmental laws, which are becoming more stringent throughout the world. For example, the EPA regulates the use of ethylene oxide for sterilization of medical devices and is increasingly focused on reducing emissions from the ethylene oxide sterilization process, which has increased our costs of operations and necessitated changes to our manufacturing plants and processes. Additionally, the European Economic Area (EEA) has placed a sunset date for the use of Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP); and the EEA is considering regulations on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and fluorinated gases. These regulatory changes could adversely impact on our ability to manufacture or supply certain products in the EEA. Other environmental laws may have similar consequences to us or our suppliers, or result in liability to us. Additionally, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Control and the Bureau of Industry and Security at the U.S. Department of Commerce administer laws and regulations that restrict U.S. persons and, in some instances, non-U.S. persons, in conducting activities, transacting business or making investments in certain countries, or with governments, entities and individuals subject to U.S. economic sanctions. From time to time, certain of our subsidiaries have limited business dealings with countries subject to these sanctions, including Iran, Sudan, Syria, Russia and Cuba. These dealings represent an insignificant amount of our consolidated revenues and income but expose us to an increased risk of operating in these countries, including foreign exchange risks or restrictions or limitations on our ability to access funds generated in these jurisdictions, or the risk of violating applicable sanctions or regulations, which are complex and subject to frequent change. Our compliance programs, training, monitoring and policies may not always protect us from conduct by individual employees that violate these laws. Violations or allegations of violations of these laws may result in large civil and criminal penalties, debarment or exclusion from participating in government programs, diversion of management time, attention and resources and may otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The laws and regulations discussed above are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations and changes, which may be violated unknowingly, could require us to incur substantial costs regarding compliance or to alter our sales and marketing practices and may subject us to enforcement actions or litigation which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot predict with certainty what laws, regulations and healthcare initiatives, if any, will be implemented, or what the ultimate effect of healthcare reform or any future legislation or regulation will have on us. For more information related to ongoing government investigations, see Note 7 in Item 8 of this Annual Report. For more information on regulatory matters currently affecting us, including quality-related matters, see “Certain Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of this Annual Report.Increasing regulatory focus on privacy and security issues and expanding laws could impact our business and expose us to increased liability.As a global company, we are subject to global data privacy and security laws, regulations and codes of conduct that apply to our businesses. We are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing legal and regulatory requirements that govern the collection, use, storage, security, transfer, disclosure and other processing of personal 23data in the United States and in other countries, including, but not limited to, The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as amended (HIPAA), The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the newly revised NIS2 Directive, a European Union wide cybersecurity legislation (which will be fully in force in 2024). The GDPR imposes stringent European Union data protection requirements and provides for significant penalties for noncompliance (including heightened fines as compared to prior years). HIPAA also imposes stringent data privacy and security requirements and the regulatory authority has imposed significant fines and penalties on organizations found to be out of compliance. CCPA provides consumers with a private right of action against companies who have a security breach due to lack of appropriate security measures. More states (including Colorado, Connecticut, Utah and Virginia) plan to introduce similar legislation in 2023. We or our third-party providers and business partners may also be subjected to audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to compliance with information security and privacy laws and regulations, and noncompliance with the laws and regulations could result in substantial and material fines or class action litigation. If reimbursement or other payment for our current or future products is reduced or modified in the United States or in foreign countries, including through the implementation or repeal of government-sponsored healthcare reform or other similar actions, cost containment measures, or changes to policies with respect to pricing, taxation or rebates, our business could suffer.Sales of our products depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our products are paid by both public and private payers. These payers include Medicare, Medicaid, and private healthcare insurers in the United States and foreign governments and third-party payers outside the United States. Our work with government payers carries various risks inherent in working with government entities and agencies, including government reporting and auditing, additional regulatory oversight, mandated contractual terms, failure of government appropriations or other complex procedural requirements.Public and private payers are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. We may continue to experience downward pricing pressures from any or all of these payers which could result in an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operational results. Global efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing. Governments around the world use various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures, such as price controls, the formation of public contracting authorities, product formularies, which are lists of recommended or approved products, and competitive tenders which require the submission of a bid to sell products. Sales of our products are dependent, in part, on the availability of reimbursement by government agencies and healthcare programs, as well as insurance companies and other private payers. In much of Europe, Latin America, Asia and Australia, the government provides healthcare at low cost to patients, and controls its expenditures by purchasing products through public tenders, collective purchasing, regulating prices, setting reference prices in public tenders or limiting reimbursement or patient access to certain products. For example, China has been implementing volume-based procurement policies, a series of centralized reforms being instituted in China on both a national and regional basis that has resulted in significant price cuts for pharmaceuticals and medical consumables. Additionally, austerity measures or other reforms by foreign governments may limit, reduce or eliminate payments for our products and adversely affect both pricing flexibility and demand for our products. In addition, our recent acquisition of Hillrom has increased our exposure to risks related to reimbursement as certain portions of that business directly bill various government agencies.The Healthcare Reform Act includes several provisions which impact our businesses in the United States, including increased Medicaid rebates and an expansion of the 340B Drug Pricing Program which provides certain qualified entities with discounts on the purchase of drugs for outpatient use and an excise tax on the sale of certain drugs. The Healthcare Reform Act reduces Medicare and Medicaid payments to hospitals and other providers, which may cause us to experience downward pricing pressure. Certain portions of the Healthcare Reform Act could negatively impact the demand for our products, and therefore our results of operations and financial position. In 2019, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services launched a new kidney health initiative. The CMS published the final End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Treatment Choices (ETC) mandatory payment model in 2020. The ETC launched in 30% of dialysis clinics across the country on January 1, 2021 and creates payment incentives for the greater use of home dialysis and kidney transplants for those new to and already on dialysis. CMS also announced the implementation of four voluntary payment models with the stated goal of helping healthcare providers reduce the cost and improve the quality of care for patients with late-stage chronic kidney disease and ESRD. CMS has stated these payment models are aimed to prevent or delay the need for dialysis and encourage kidney transplantation. CMS launched the program on January 1, 2022, at which time 85 entities were enrolled as 24participants. These proposed regulatory changes in kidney health policy and reimbursement may substantially change the U.S. end stage renal disease market and could increase demand for our peritoneal dialysis products, necessitating significant multi-year capital expenditures in order to meet that demand. However, the impact of such changes and related expenses are difficult to estimate in advance.In addition, a substantial portion of our revenues is dependent on federal healthcare program reimbursement, and any disruptions in federal government operations, including a federal government shutdown or failure of the U.S. government to enact annual appropriations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, disruptions in federal government operations may negatively impact regulatory approvals and guidance that are important to our operations and create uncertainty about the pace of upcoming healthcare regulatory developments or approvals.As a result of these and other measures, including future measures or reforms that cannot be predicted, reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive basis. Legislation and regulations affecting reimbursement for our products may change at any time and in ways that may be adverse to us. We cannot predict the impact of these pressures and initiatives, or any negative effects of any additional regulations that may affect our business. We could be subject to fines or damages and possible exclusion from participation in federal or state healthcare programs if we fail to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our business.Portions of our business are subject to stringent laws and regulations at the federal or state levels governing the participation of durable medical equipment suppliers and independent diagnostic testing facilities in federal and state healthcare programs. From time to time, the government seeks additional information related to our claims submissions, and in some instances government contractors perform audits of payments made to us under Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal healthcare programs. On occasion, these reviews identify overpayments for which we submit refunds. At other times, our own internal audits identify the need to refund payments. We believe the frequency and intensity of government audits and review processes has grown and we expect this will continue in the future, due to increased resources allocated to these activities at both the federal and state Medicaid level, and greater sophistication in data review techniques.In addition, our business contracts with foreign and U.S. federal, state and local government entities and is subject to specific rules, regulations and approvals applicable to government contractors. Our failure to comply with these could result in contract terminations, suspension or debarment from contracting with these entities, civil fines and damages, criminal prosecution and possible exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, as well as possible recoupment of any overpayments related to such violations. While we believe that our practices materially comply with applicable state and federal requirements, the requirements might be interpreted in a manner inconsistent with our interpretation. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, even if inadvertent, could have a material adverse impact on our business.If we are unable to protect our patents or other proprietary rights, or if we infringe the patents or other proprietary rights of others, our competitiveness and business prospects may be materially damaged.Patent and other proprietary rights are essential to our business. Our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain and enforce patents and licenses to patent rights, both in the United States and in other countries. We cannot guarantee that pending patent applications will result in issued patents, that patents issued or licensed will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, that our patents will not be found to be invalid or that the intellectual property rights of others will not prevent us from selling certain products or including key features in our products.The patent position of a healthcare company is often uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. Significant litigation concerning patents and products is pervasive in our industry. Patent claims include challenges to the coverage and validity of our patents on products or processes as well as allegations that our products infringe patents held by competitors or other third parties. An unfavorable litigation outcome in any of these types of cases could result in a loss of patent protection or the ability to market products, which could lead to a significant loss of sales, or otherwise materially affect future results of operations. We also rely on trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and know-how to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive positions. Third parties may know, discover or independently develop equivalent proprietary information or techniques, or they may gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our trade secrets to the public.Although our employees, consultants, parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners are generally subject to confidentiality or similar agreements to protect our confidential and proprietary information, these 25agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. To the extent that our employees, consultants, parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.Furthermore, our intellectual property, proprietary technology and sensitive company data is potentially vulnerable to loss, damage or misappropriation from system malfunction, computer viruses and unauthorized access to our data or misappropriation or misuse thereof by those with permitted access and other events. While we have invested to protect our intellectual property, confidential information and other data, and continue to work diligently in this area, there can be no assurance that our precautionary measures have prevented or will prevent future breakdowns, breaches, cyber incidents or other events. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.Changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities may have a negative impact on our operating results.Changes to the tax laws in the United States or other countries in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our operating results. For example, the outcome of various initiatives currently being undertaken by the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, and the implementation of such initiatives by taxing authorities across the world, could significantly impact how we allocate profits across multiple jurisdictions, which could adversely impact our global tax obligations.Taxing authorities audit us from time to time and may disagree with certain positions we have taken in respect of our tax liabilities. Our tax liabilities are affected by many factors, including the amounts we charge in intra-company transactions for inventory, services, licenses, funding and other items, which are subject to the use of assumptions and judgment. Because we operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States, cross border transactions among our affiliates are a significant part of the manner in which we operate. Although we believe that we transact intra-company business in accordance with arm's-length principles, tax authorities may disagree with our intra-company charges, cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters, and may assess additional taxes as a result, including in connection with their review of the restated financial statements we have filed as part of our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. However, we may not accurately predict the outcome of these audits and, as a result, the actual outcome of these audits may have an adverse impact on our financial results. For more information on ongoing audits, see Note 13 in Item 8 of this Annual Report.We are party to a number of pending lawsuits and other disputes which may have an adverse impact on our business, operations or financial condition.We are party to a number of pending lawsuits, settlement discussions, mediations, arbitrations and other disputes, many of which are set forth in Note 7 in Item 8 of this Annual Report. In addition, in the future we may be party to additional lawsuits, disputes or other matters, including patent, product liability or other lawsuits. These current and future matters may result in a loss of patent protection, reduced revenue, incurrence of significant liabilities and diversion of our management’s time, attention and resources. Given the uncertain nature of litigation and other disputes generally, we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in our current matters. In view of these uncertainties, the outcome of these current matters may result in charges in excess of any established reserves, and, to the extent available, liability insurance. We also continue to be self-insured with respect to product liability claims. The absence of third-party insurance coverage for current or future claims increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims and adverse decisions. Protracted litigation and other disputes, including any adverse outcomes, may have an adverse impact on our business, operations or financial condition. Even claims without merit could subject us to adverse publicity and require us to incur significant legal fees"
5,BAX,BAXTER INTERNATIONAL INC,2022-02-23,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
.  In addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K (Annual Report), stockholders or prospective investors should carefully consider the following risk factors. If any of the events described below occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, future growth prospects and stock price could suffer.6Risks Relating to the COVID-19 PandemicThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have had, and we expect will continue to have, a material adverse effect on our business. The nature and extent of future impacts are uncertain and unpredictable.Our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises, including epidemics and pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 has had, and we expect will continue to have, an adverse impact on our operations, supply chains and distribution systems and has increased and will continue to increase our expenses, including due to preventive and precautionary measures that we, other businesses and governments have taken and may continue to take. These measures have led to unprecedented restrictions on, disruptions in, and other related impacts on businesses and personal activities. We expect that evolving restrictions and precautions, as well as the corresponding need to adapt to new methods of conducting business remotely, will continue to have an adverse effect on our business. Risks associated with COVID-19 include, but are not limited to, the following:•We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, significant and unpredictable reductions or increases in demand for certain of our products as healthcare customers re-prioritize the treatment of patients. Some of our products are particularly sensitive to reductions in elective medical procedures. For example, due to the recent spread of the Omicron variant, many elective procedures have been suspended or postponed in our principal markets as hospital systems prioritize treatment of COVID-19 patients again or otherwise comply with changing government guidelines. It is not possible to predict the timing of a broad resumption of elective medical procedures or whether, once resumed, further delays or cancellations may occur in the future in connection with the spread of new variants. If patients and hospital systems continue to de-prioritize, delay or cancel elective procedures, our business, financial condition and results of operations would continue to be negatively affected.•A significant number of our suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and vendors have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, including with respect to increased absenteeism among their employees and other obstacles relating to their ability to maintain the continuity of their on-site operations. These impacts have caused interruptions and delays in our supply chain, and may continue to do so, resulting in more expensive alternative sources of labor and materials and heightened supply chain costs. Any delay or shortage in the supply of components or materials or other operational or logistical challenges impacts our ability to satisfy consumer demand for our products in a timely manner or at all, which could harm our reputation, future sales and profitability. For example, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience supply constraints for amino acid raw materials used in our parenteral nutrition products, as such materials are being used to produce COVID-19 vaccines. These constraints have resulted in certain product backorders and may do so in the future.•We could experience a loss of sales and profitability due to delayed payments, reduced demand or insolvency of healthcare professionals, hospitals and other customers, and suppliers and vendors facing liquidity or other financial issues. These liquidity or other financial issues could be exacerbated if prolonged high levels of unemployment or loss of insurance coverage impact patients’ ability to access treatments that use our products and services. •COVID-19 has adversely impacted the continued service and availability of skilled personnel necessary to run our operations. For example, we have faced increased absenteeism in connection with the rise of recent COVID-19 variants. Although we have sought to mitigate these staffing challenges through overtime and enlisting contingent labor, staffing shortages have strained our operations and increased our expenses. In addition, we may be unable to retain employees who object to governmental vaccine mandates or heightened safety protocols. Vaccination is currently required for employees who are customer-facing and/or directly engaged with hospitals and medical care providers covered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). To the extent our management or other personnel are impacted in significant numbers by COVID-19 and are not available to perform their professional duties, we could experience further disruptions in our manufacturing operations or disruptions in other activities and other functions. •We face increased operational challenges as we continue to take measures to support and protect employee health and safety, including through office closures, vaccine mandates and work from home policies. For example, remote working arrangements heighten our risks associated with information technology systems and networks, including cyber-attacks, computer viruses, malicious software, security breaches, and telecommunication failures, both for systems and networks we control directly and for those 7that employees and third-party developers rely on to work remotely. Any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches or cyber risks or detect, or respond adequately to, a security breach or cyber risk, or any other disruptions to our information technology systems and networks (as a result of remote working arrangements or otherwise), can have adverse effects on our business and cause reputational and financial harm. These risks are particularly heightened due to COVID‑19 as cybercriminals attempt to profit from COVID-related disruptions. Any of these and other impacts of the pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Finally, to the extent COVID-19 adversely affects our operations and global economic conditions more generally, many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors
” section may be heightened. Risks Related to Our Ability to Grow Our BusinessIf we are unable to successfully introduce new products or fail to keep pace with changing consumer preferences and needs and advances in technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.We need to successfully introduce new products to achieve our strategic business objectives. We can provide no assurances that our new products will achieve commercial acceptance in the marketplace. In addition, difficulties in manufacturing or in obtaining regulatory approvals, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, might delay or prohibit introduction of new products into the marketplace. We may not be able to obtain patent protection on our new products or be able to defend our intellectual property rights globally. Warranty claims and service costs relating to our new products might be greater than anticipated, and we might be required to devote significant resources to address any quality issues associated with our new products, which could reduce the resources available for further new product development and other matters. In addition, the introduction of new products might also cause customers to defer purchases of existing products. Our future financial performance will also depend in part on our ability to influence, anticipate, identify and respond to changing consumer preferences and needs, including those impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. We might not correctly anticipate or identify trends in customer preferences or needs or might identify them later than competitors do.Failure to successfully introduce new products in a cost-effective manner, or delays in customer purchasing decisions related to the evaluation of new products, could cause us to lose market share and could materially adversely affect our business. Furthermore, product development requires substantial investment and there is inherent risk in the R&D process. A successful product development process further depends on many other factors, including our ability to adapt to new technologies, demonstrate satisfactory clinical results and differentiate our products from those of our competitors. If we cannot successfully introduce new products or adapt to changing technologies, our products may become obsolete and our revenue and profitability could suffer. Issues with product supply or quality could have an adverse effect on our business or cause a loss of customer confidence in us or our products, among other negative consequences.Our success depends upon the availability and quality of our products and the underlying raw materials and component parts. The medical products and pharmaceutical industries are competitive and subject to complex market dynamics and varying demand levels. These levels vary in response to economic conditions, regulatory requirements, seasonality, natural disasters, pandemics, epidemics and other matters. For example, for many of our suppliers, the COVID-19 pandemic has created increased employee absenteeism rates and other obstacles relating to their ability to maintain the continuity of their on-site operations. These increased rates and other obstacles have increased the cost of certain raw materials and component parts and caused us to incur increased freight costs. They may, in the future, prevent suppliers from providing good and services to us on reasonable terms or at all.Additionally, the development of new or enhanced products involves a lengthy regulatory process and is capital intensive. As a result, our ability to match our production levels and capacity to market demand is imprecise and may result in a failure to meet market demand or satisfy customer requirements for our products or, alternatively, an oversupply of inventory. Increased costs relating to freight, raw materials or component parts and difficulties hiring and retaining staff have had and may continue to have a negative impact on product supply. Failure to meet market demand may result in customers transitioning to available competitive products, loss of market share, negative publicity, reputational damage, loss of customer confidence or other negative consequences (including a decline in stock price). 8Our success also depends on our ability to maintain and routinely improve product quality and our quality management program. Quality management plays an essential role in meeting customer requirements, preventing defects, improving our products and services and assuring the safety and efficacy of our products. While we have a quality system that covers the lifecycle of our products, quality and safety issues have and may in the future occur with respect to our products. New or unintended uses of our products (for example, in response to COVID-19 or changing clinical practice) may also raise quality or safety issues. A quality or safety issue may result in adverse inspection reports, voluntary or official action indicated, warning letters, import bans, product recalls (either voluntary or required by FDA or similar governmental authorities in other countries) or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions (which may include corporate integrity agreements), costly litigation, refusal of a government to grant approvals and licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. See “—Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters.” An inability to address a quality or safety issue in an effective and timely manner may also cause negative publicity, a loss of customer confidence in us or our current or future products, which may result in the loss of sales and difficulty in successfully launching new products. Additionally, we have made and continue to make significant investments in assets, including inventory and property, plant and equipment, which relate to potential new products or modifications to existing products. Product quality or safety issues may restrict us from being able to realize the expected returns from these investments, potentially resulting in asset impairments in the future.Unaffiliated third-party suppliers provide a number of goods and services to our R&D, clinical and manufacturing organizations, many of whom do so on a spot basis and not pursuant to a contractual arrangement. Our ability to receive goods or services at all or on reasonable financial terms from these third parties will be impacted if they are unable or refuse to supply or service us. Moreover, we may have limited or no recourse if the goods or services are not subject to contractual terms. If we are unable to identify an alternative provider on reasonable terms, our ability to meet our obligations to our customers could be negatively impacted, which could adversely affect our financial results and our reputation. Additionally, third party suppliers are required to comply with our quality standards. Failure of a third-party supplier to provide compliant raw materials, component parts or supplies could result in delays, service interruptions or other quality related issues that may negatively impact our business results.There is substantial competition in the product markets in which we operate and the risk of declining demand and pricing pressures could adversely affect our operating results.Although no single company competes with us in all of our businesses, we face substantial competition in all of our markets from international and domestic healthcare medical products and pharmaceutical companies and providers of all sizes, and these competitors often differ across our businesses. Competition is primarily focused on cost-effectiveness, price, service, product performance, and technological innovation.Competition may increase further as additional companies begin to enter our markets or modify their existing products to compete directly with ours. If our competitors respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or we do not introduce new versions or upgrades to our product portfolio in response to those requirements, our products may be rendered obsolete or non-competitive. If our competitors develop more effective or affordable products or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than we do, our business, financial condition and operations will likely be negatively affected. If we are forced to reduce our prices due to increased competition, our business could become less profitable. In addition, many healthcare industry companies, including healthcare systems, distributors, manufacturers, providers, and insurers, are consolidating or have formed strategic alliances. As the healthcare industry consolidates, competition to provide goods and services to industry participants will become more intense. Further, this consolidation creates larger enterprises with greater negotiating power, which they can use to negotiate price concessions. If we face an increase in costs or must reduce our prices because of industry consolidation, or if we lose customers as a result of consolidation, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. Demand for our products and services depends in large part on overall demand in the healthcare market. With the healthcare market’s increased focus on hospital asset and resource efficiency as well as reimbursement constraints, spending for some of our products could decline over time. Further, the competitive pressures in our industry could cause us to lose market share unless we increase our commercial investments or reduce our prices, which could adversely impact our operating results. These factors, along with possible legislative developments and others, might result in significant shifts in market share among the industry’s major participants, which includes us. Accordingly, if we are unable to effectively differentiate ourselves from our competitors in terms of new products and 9diversification of our product portfolio through business acquisitions, then our market share, sales and profitability could be adversely impacted through lower volume or decreased prices.We may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the Hillrom acquisition.During 2021, we completed the acquisition of Hillrom. The success of this acquisition depends on, among other things, our ability to integrate Hillrom in a manner that facilitates growth opportunities, realizes anticipated cost and revenue synergies (some of which are still being identified) and achieves certain previously communicated net leverage targets without adversely affecting current revenues and investments in future growth. If we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the Hillrom acquisition may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.There is a significant degree of difficulty and management distraction inherent in the process of integrating an acquisition.  These difficulties include challenges consolidating certain operations and functions (including regulatory and other corporate functions), integrating technologies (including differing IT systems and processes), organizations, procedures, policies and operations, addressing differences in the business cultures of the two companies and retaining key personnel. The integration may be complex and time consuming and involve delays or additional and unforeseen expenses. The integration process and other disruptions resulting from the Hillrom acquisition may also disrupt our ongoing businesses or cause inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our relationships with market participants, employees, regulators and others with whom we and Hillrom have business or other dealings. Any failure to successfully or cost-effectively integrate Hillrom could have a material adverse effect on our business and cause reputational harm.If our business development activities are unsuccessful, we may not realize the intended benefits.We expect to continue to engage in business development activities, including evaluating acquisitions, joint development opportunities, technology licensing arrangements and other opportunities. These activities may result in substantial investment of our resources. Our success developing products or expanding into new markets from such activities will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to find suitable opportunities for acquisition, investment or alliance; competition from other companies in the industries in which we operate that are seeking similar opportunities; whether we are able to complete an acquisition, investment or alliance on terms that are satisfactory to us; the strength of the other company’s underlying technology, products and ability to execute its business strategies; any intellectual property and litigation related to the other company’s products or technology; and our ability to successfully integrate the acquired company, business, product, technology or research into our existing operations, including the ability to adequately fund acquired in-process R&D projects and to maintain adequate controls over the combined operations. Certain of these activities are subject to antitrust and competition laws, which laws could impact our ability to pursue strategic transactions and could result in mandated divestitures in the context of proposed acquisitions. If we are unsuccessful in our business development activities, we may not realize the intended benefits of such activities, including that acquisition and integration costs may be greater than expected or the possibility that expected return on investment, synergies and accretion will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected timeframes. For more information, see Note 2 in Item 8 of this Annual Report.If we fail to attract and retain key employees our business may suffer.Our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees, including people in senior management, sales, marketing, information technology and R&D positions and from the recently acquired Hillrom business. Competition for top talent in the healthcare industry can be intense. Our ability to recruit and retain such talent will depend on a number of factors, including hiring practices of our competitors, compensation and benefits, work location, work environment (including our competitors’ policies regarding remote work arrangements and COVID-19 protocols) and industry economic conditions. If we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified employees, our business could suffer.Risks Related to Our Business Operations Segments of our business are significantly dependent on major contracts with GPOs, IDNs, and certain other distributors and purchasers.A portion of our U.S. hospital sales and rentals are made pursuant to contracts with hospital GPOs. At any given time, we are typically at various stages of responding to bids, negotiating and renewing expiring GPO agreements. Failure to be included in certain of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business, 10including product sales and service and rental revenue. In addition, we have faced and continue to face challenges related to increasing costs associated with these agreements (associated with ongoing supply chain challenges), which negatively impact our revenues.Our participation in such programs often requires increased discounting or restrictions on our ability to raise prices, and failure to participate or to be selected for participation in such programs might result in a reduction of sales to the member hospitals. In addition, the industry is showing an increased focus on contracting directly with health systems or IDNs (which typically represent influential members and owners of GPOs). IDNs and health systems often make key purchasing decisions and have influence over the GPO’s contract decisions, and often request additional discounts or other enhancements. Further, certain other distributors and purchasers have similar processes to the GPOs and IDNs and failure to be included in agreements with these other purchasers could have a material adverse effect on our business.We may not be successful in achieving expected operating efficiencies and sustaining or improving operating expense reductions, and might experience business disruptions and adverse tax consequences associated with restructuring, realignment and cost reduction activities.Portions of our business have been, and following the Hillrom acquisition may be, the subject of restructuring, realignment and cost reduction initiatives. While we initiate these actions with the goal of  realizing efficiencies, we may not be successful in achieving the full efficiencies and cost reduction benefits we expect. Further, such benefits might be realized later than expected, and the ongoing costs of implementing these measures might be greater than anticipated. If these measures are not successful or sustainable, we might undertake additional realignment and cost reduction efforts, which could result in future charges. Moreover, our ability to achieve our other strategic goals and business plans might be adversely affected, and we could experience business disruptions, if our restructuring and realignment efforts and our cost reduction activities prove ineffective. These actions, the resulting costs, and potential delays or potential lower than anticipated benefits might also impact our foreign tax positions and might require us to record tax reserves against certain deferred tax assets in our international business.We have incurred a substantial amount of debt in connection with the Hillrom acquisition, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.We have incurred acquisition-related debt financing of approximately $11.8 billion to fund the cash consideration for the Hillrom acquisition, refinance certain indebtedness of Hillrom and pay related fees and expenses. Our substantially increased indebtedness and higher debt-to-equity ratio following the acquisition has the effect, among other things, of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and has increased our borrowing costs (including as a result of the downgrade in our senior debt credit ratings). The increased levels of indebtedness could also reduce funds available for investments in product development, capital expenditures, dividend payments, acquisitions, share repurchases and other activities and may create competitive disadvantages for us relative to other companies with lower debt levels. In addition, until we achieve our commitment to reduce our indebtedness following the Hillrom acquisition, our capital allocation activities and operational flexibility may be limited.  There can be no assurance that we will be successful in doing so on a timely basis or at all.If we are unable to obtain sufficient components or raw materials on a timely basis or for a cost-effective price or if we experience other manufacturing, sterilization, supply or distribution difficulties, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.The manufacture of our products requires, among other things, the timely supply or delivery of sufficient amounts of quality components and materials. We manufacture our products in approximately 50 manufacturing facilities around the world. We acquire our components, materials and other requirements for manufacturing from many suppliers and vendors in various countries, including sometimes from ourselves for self-supplied requirements. We endeavor, either alone or working closely with our suppliers, to ensure the continuity of our inputs and supplies but we cannot guarantee these efforts will always be successful. Further, while efforts are made to diversify certain of our sources of components and materials, in certain instances there is only a sole source or supplier with no alternatives yet identified. Additionally, we obtain certain components and materials on a spot basis from third party suppliers with whom we do not have a contractual arrangement. For most of our components and materials for which a single source or supplier is used, alternative sources or suppliers may exist, but we have made a strategic determination to use the single source or supplier. Although we do carry strategic inventory and maintain insurance to help mitigate the potential risk related to any supply disruption, such measures may not be sufficient or effective. A reduction,  interruption or suspension in supply, other supply chain issues, including those due to the revocation of distribution facilities’ licenses, and our inability to quickly develop acceptable alternative sources for such supply 11could adversely affect our ability to manufacture, distribute and sell our products in a timely or cost-effective manner. We have faced difficulties obtaining supplies of key materials such as electromechanical components, active ingredients for pharmaceuticals and resins due to the COVID-19 pandemic and related supply chain disruptions. Moreover, changes in regulation, world trade policies, international taxes and government-to-government relations and issues with export and import activities could negatively impact our ability to distribute products within a country and across countries. See “—Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters.” Additionally, volatility in our costs of energy, transportation/freight, components, raw materials and other supply, manufacturing and distribution costs have had and could in the future adversely affect our results of operations. These prices might continue to fluctuate based on many factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to, changes in general economic conditions, labor costs, delivery costs, competition and currency exchange rates.Significant increases in the cost of raw materials, sub-assemblies or materials used in the production of our products that cannot be recovered through increased prices of our products (or the unavailability of those raw materials, sub-assemblies or production materials) could adversely affect our results of operations. There can be no assurance that the marketplace will support higher prices or that such prices and productivity gains will fully offset any commodity cost increases in the future. We may from time to time engage in hedging transactions with respect to raw material purchases but do enter into fixed price supply contracts at times. Future decisions not to engage in hedging transactions or ineffective hedging transactions might result in increased cost volatility, potentially adversely impacting our profitability.Many of our products are difficult to manufacture. This is due to the complex nature of manufacturing devices and pharmaceuticals, including biologics, as well as the strict regulatory regime governing our manufacturing operations. Variations in the manufacturing process may result in production failures which could lead to launch delays, product shortage, unanticipated costs, lost revenues and damage to our reputation. A failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers may also result in a quality or safety issue of the type discussed above.Some of our products are manufactured at a single manufacturing facility or stored at a single storage site. Additionally, some of our manufacturing facilities are located in the same geographic area. Loss or damage to, or closure of, a manufacturing facility or storage site due to a natural disaster, such as we experienced as a result of Hurricane Maria, a pandemic, such as COVID-19, or otherwise could adversely affect our ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of key products or deliver products to meet customer demand or contractual requirements, which may result in a loss of revenue and other adverse business consequences (including those identified in the paragraphs above). We might be unable to transfer manufacturing of the relevant products to another facility or location in a cost-effective or timely manner, if at all. This potential inability to transfer production could occur for several reasons, including but not limited to a lack of necessary relevant manufacturing capability at another facility, or the regulatory requirements of the FDA or other governmental regulatory bodies. Such an event could materially negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, several of our manufacturing facilities are leased and we may not be able to renew leases on favorable terms or at all. Because of the time required to approve and license a manufacturing facility, a third-party manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis (if at all) to replace production capacity in the event we lose manufacturing capacity or products are otherwise unavailable. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Some of our products require sterilization prior to sale or distribution, and we utilize both Baxter-owned and third-party facilities for this process. If an event occurs that results in damage to or closure, whether temporarily or permanent, of one or more of these facilities, we may be unable to manufacture or sterilize the relevant products at prior levels or at all, and a third party may not be available on a timely basis (if at all) to replace sterilization capacity. For example, in May 2021, our facility in Mountain Home, Arkansas, entered into a Consent Administrative Order with the Arkansas Division of Environmental Quality relating to certain air emission control technology used to reduce ethylene oxide-emissions from sterilization equipment. Although the events giving rise to the Consent Administrative Order only caused a temporary pause in operations, these events or other disruptions of manufacturing or sterilization processes that we or third parties may experience, whether due to lack of capacity, environmental, regulatory or compliance issues or otherwise, could result in product shortage, unanticipated costs, loss of revenues, litigation and damage to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 12Climate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.The long-term effects of climate change are difficult to predict and may be widespread. The impacts of climate change may include physical risks (e.g., rising sea levels or frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions, including natural disasters), social and human effects (e.g., population dislocations or harm to health and well-being), compliance costs and transition risks (e.g., regulatory or technology changes), shifts in market trends (e.g., customers increasingly prioritize purchasing products that are sustainably made) and other adverse effects. Such impacts may disrupt our supply chain and operations by adversely affecting our ability to procure goods or services required for the operation of our business at the quantities and levels we require, due to impairment of the availability and cost of certain products, materials, commodities and energy. For example, material or sustained increases in the price of oil could have an adverse impact on the cost of many of the plastic materials or resins we use to make and package our products, as well as our transportation/freight costs. These outcomes may in turn result in customers transitioning to available competitive products, loss of market share, negative publicity, reputational damage, loss of customer confidence or other negative consequences (including a decline in stock price).In addition, the increasing concern over climate change has resulted and may continue to result in more regional, federal, and/or global legal and regulatory requirements relating to climate change, including regulating greenhouse gas emissions (and the establishment of enhanced internal processes or systems to track them), alternative energy policies and sustainability initiatives. If legislation or regulations are enacted or promulgated in the United States or in any other jurisdictions in which we do business that impose more stringent restrictions and requirements than our current legal or regulatory obligations, we may experience disruptions in, or increases in the costs associated with, sourcing, manufacturing and distributing our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or result of operations. Any such regulatory changes could have a significant effect on our operating and financial decisions, including those involving capital expenditures to reduce emissions and comply with other regulatory requirements.  Breaches and breakdowns affecting our information technology systems or protected data, including from cyber security breaches and data leakage, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, reputation and competitive position.We rely upon information technology systems and infrastructure, including support provided by our partners and third parties, to support our business, products and customers. For example, we routinely rely on technology systems and infrastructure in the collection, use, storage and transfer, disclosure and other processing of voluminous amounts of data including confidential, business, financial, personal and other sensitive information (collectively, Confidential Information). We also rely on systems for manufacturing, customer orders, shipping, regulatory compliance and various other matters. Certain of our products and systems collect data regarding patients and their therapy and some are internet enabled or connect to our systems for maintenance and other purposes. Some of our products, even though not internet enabled nor connected to our systems, connect to hospital networks, electronic medical records or electronic health records. The continuing evolution of technology we use, including cloud-based computing, and reliance on third parties creates additional opportunities for the unintentional, intentional and/or unauthorized exposure, dissemination and/or destruction of Confidential Information stored in our devices, systems, servers, infrastructure and products (collectively, Technology). Security threats, including cyber and other attacks, are becoming increasingly sophisticated, frequent and adaptive.Our Technology is vulnerable to breakdown, interruption, cyber and other security attacks, system malfunction, unauthorized access, inadvertent exposure or disclosure of information, theft and other events. Third-party systems that we rely upon could also become vulnerable to the same risks and may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could result in system disruption or compromise the information security of our own systems. Any such vulnerability could compromise our Technology and could expose Confidential Information to unauthorized third parties and/or cause permanent loss of such data. In addition to loss of Confidential Information, unauthorized access to or interference with our Technology may cause product functionality issues that may result in risk to patient safety, field actions and/or product recalls. We have, like other large multi-national companies, experienced cyber incidents in the past and may experience them in the future, which have exposed and may continue to expose vulnerabilities in our information technology systems. Although the prior incidents have not had a material effect on our business and we have invested and continue to invest in the protection of data and Technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts have prevented or will prevent breakdowns, attacks, breaches in our Technology, cyber incidents or other incidents or ensure compliance with all applicable security and 13privacy laws, regulations and standards, including with respect to third-party service providers that host or process Confidential Information on our behalf. Such incidents could result in unauthorized access to patient data and other Confidential Information and could pose a risk to patient safety. Any failure to protect against such incidents can lead to substantial and material regulatory fines and penalties, business disruption, reputational harm, financial loss, litigation as well as other damages. Misappropriation or other loss of our intellectual property from any of the foregoing may have an adverse effect on our competitive position and may cause us to incur substantial litigation costs. See “—Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters.” As the FDA, other regulators and our customers become more sensitive to risks related to cybersecurity, our ability to meet certain information technology safety standards could affect our products’ marketability and competitiveness. We could also suffer strained relationships with customers, business partners, physicians and other healthcare professionals, increased costs (for security measures, remediation or otherwise), litigation (including class actions and stockholder derivative actions) or other negative consequences (including a decline in stock price) from breaches, cyber and other security attacks, industrial espionage, ransomware, email or phishing scams, malware or other cyber incidents, which may compromise our system infrastructure or lead to data leakage, either internally or at our third-party providers or other business partners.In addition, significant implementation issues may arise as we continue to consolidate and outsource certain computer operations and application support activities. Further, a greater number of our employees are working remotely in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the emergence of related variants, which (among other things) could expose us to greater risks related to cybersecurity and our information technology systems. We also face all of the same risks listed above and other heightened risks when acquiring a company, in particular if we need to transition or implement certain processes or controls with the acquired company. For example, as we integrate Hillrom into our business, we may identify vulnerabilities or other issues as we transition its information technology systems and processes to our processes and controls, including with respect to cybersecurity and privacy. Any such vulnerabilities if unidentified or unremediated could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.  We are subject to risks associated with doing business globally.Our operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business globally and under the laws, regulations and customs of various jurisdictions and geographies. These risks include changes in exchange controls and other governmental actions, loss of business in government and public tenders that are held annually in many cases, increasingly complex labor environments, availability of raw materials and component parts, changes in taxation, tariffs, export control restrictions, changes in or violations of U.S. or local laws, dependence on a few government entities as customers, pricing restrictions, economic and political instability, monetary or currency volatility or instability (including as it relates to the U.S. dollar, the Euro, the Yuan and currencies in emerging market countries (including the Turkish Lira)), disputes between countries, trade relationships and conflicts, diminished or insufficient protection of intellectual property, and disruption or destruction of operations in a significant geographic region regardless of cause, including natural disaster, pandemic, power loss, cyber-attack, data breach, war, terrorism, riot, labor disruption, civil insurrection or social unrest. Failure to comply with, or material changes to, the laws and regulations that affect our global operations could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.The escalating global economic competition and trade tensions between the U.S., China and Russia could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Although we have been able to mitigate some of the impact from increased duties imposed by these countries (through petitioning the governments for tariff exclusions and other mitigations), the risk remains of additional tariffs and other kinds of restrictions. Tariff exclusions awarded to us by the U.S. Government require annual renewal, and policies for granting exclusions could shift. The U.S., China and Russia could impose other types of restrictions such as limitations on government procurement or technology export restrictions, which could affect our access to the markets. More generally, several governments have raised the possibility of policies to induce “re-shoring” of supply chains, less reliance on imported supplies, and greater national production. For example, the Chinese government has issued a series of policies in the past several years to promote local medical devices or suggest government procurement budget for local products.  Another example would be the stronger “Buy American” requirements in the U.S. (pursuant to a U.S. executive order by the new Administration on January 25, 2021) or U.S. withdrawal from the World Trade Organization Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA). If such steps triggered retaliation in other markets, such as by restricting access to foreign products in purchases by their government-owned healthcare systems, the outcomes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.14A portion of our workforce is unionized, and we could face labor disruptions that would interfere with our operations.Some of our employees both in and outside of the United States (including contingent workers) work under collective bargaining agreements and/or national trade union agreements. Although we have not recently experienced any significant work stoppages as a result of labor disagreements, we cannot ensure that such a stoppage will not occur in the future. Two collective bargaining agreements for one of our U.S. manufacturing facilities are scheduled to expire in February 2022 and January 2024, respectively. On February 23, 2022, union members are scheduled to vote on whether to enter into a new collective bargaining agreement (in place of the one scheduled to expire in February 2022) or to authorize a potential strike. Our inability to negotiate satisfactory new agreements or a labor disturbance at any of our manufacturing facilities (including at the facility with a collective bargaining agreement scheduled to expire in February 2022) could have a material adverse effect on our operations.Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory MattersWe are subject to a number of laws and regulations, non-compliance with which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and we are susceptible to a changing regulatory environment.As a participant in the healthcare industry, our operations and products, and those of our customers, are regulated by numerous government agencies, both inside and outside the United States. Laws and regulations include the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act (H.R. 3590) and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (H.R. 4872) (collectively, the Healthcare Reform Act) which aim to decrease costs through comparative effectiveness research and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies. Compliance with these and similar regulations could result in pricing pressure or negatively impact the demand for our products. In a number of situations, even though specific laws and regulations may not directly apply to us, our products must be capable of being used by our customers in a manner that complies with those laws and regulations.The manufacture, distribution, marketing and use of our products are subject to extensive regulation and scrutiny by FDA and other regulatory authorities globally. Any new product must undergo lengthy and rigorous testing and other extensive, costly and time-consuming procedures mandated by FDA and foreign regulatory authorities. The same testing and procedures sometimes apply to current products that are up for authorization or renewal or are subject to changes in laws or regulations.  For example, certain of our medical devices have to comply with the new European Union Medical Device Regulation that entered into force in May 2021. These regulations require companies that wish to manufacture and distribute medical devices in EU member states to meet certain quality system and safety requirements and ongoing product monitoring responsibilities, and obtain a “CE” marking (i.e., a mandatory conformity marking for certain products sold within the European Economic Area) for their products. Various penalties exist for non-compliance with the laws implementing the European Medical Device Regulations which if incurred, could have a material adverse impact on portions of our business, results of operations and cash flows. Changes to current products may be subject to vigorous review, including additional 510(k) and other regulatory submissions, and approvals or the time needed to secure approvals are not certain. Our facilities must be approved and licensed prior to production and remain subject to inspection from time to time thereafter. Failure to comply with the requirements of FDA or other regulatory authorities, including a failed inspection or a failure in our adverse event reporting system, could result in adverse inspection reports, voluntary or official action indicated, warning letters, import bans, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, reputational damage, injunctions to halt the manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a government to grant approvals or licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. In addition, our efforts to comply with FDA regulations have been challenged by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. For example, our attempts to rectify an outstanding warning letter for our facility in Ahmedabad have been thwarted as the FDA inspectors cannot travel to the site to evaluate our remediation efforts. The failure of our suppliers to comply with regulations could also adversely affect segments of our business as regulatory actions taken by the FDA against those manufacturers can result in product shortages, recalls or modifications. Any of these actions could cause a loss of customer confidence in us and our products, which could adversely affect our sales. Our business is also subject to risks associated with U.S. and foreign legislation, regulations and trade agreements relating to the materials we import, including quotas, duties, tariffs or taxes, other charges or restrictions on imports and the nature of materials that can be used in our products, which could adversely affect our operations and our 15ability to import materials used in our products at current or increased levels. We cannot predict whether additional U.S. and foreign customs quotas, duties (including antidumping or countervailing duties), tariffs, taxes or other charges or restrictions, requirements as to where raw materials and component parts must be purchased, additional workplace regulations or other restrictions on our imports will be imposed in the future or adversely modified, or what effect such actions would have on our costs of operations. Future quotas, duties or tariffs may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Future trade agreements could also provide our competitors with an advantage over us, or increase our costs, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.The sales, marketing and pricing of products and relationships that medical device and pharmaceutical companies have with healthcare providers are under increased scrutiny by federal, state and foreign government agencies. Compliance with the Anti-Kickback Statute, False Claims Act, Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (including as these laws relate to off-label promotion of products) and other healthcare related laws, as well as competition, data and patient privacy and export and import laws, is under increased focus by the agencies charged with overseeing such activities. The DOJ and the SEC have also increased their focus on the enforcement of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), particularly as it relates to the conduct of medical product and pharmaceutical companies. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their employees, contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Healthcare professionals in many countries are employed by the government and consequently may be considered government officials. Foreign governments have also increased their scrutiny of medical product and pharmaceutical companies’ sales and marketing activities and relationships with healthcare providers and competitive practices generally. The laws and standards governing the promotion, pricing, sale and reimbursement of our products and those governing our relationships with healthcare providers and governments, including the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, can be complicated, are subject to frequent change and may be violated unknowingly.We are also subject to environmental laws, which are becoming more stringent throughout the world. For example, the EPA regulates the use of ethylene oxide for sterilization of medical devices, as is increasingly focused on reducing emissions from the ethylene oxide sterilization process, which has increased our costs of operations and necessitated changes to our manufacturing plants and processes. Other environmental laws may have similar consequences to us or our suppliers, or result in liability to us. Additionally, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Control and the Bureau of Industry and Security at the U.S. Department of Commerce administer laws and regulations that restrict U.S. persons and, in some instances, non-U.S. persons, in conducting activities, transacting business or making investments in certain countries, or with governments, entities and individuals subject to U.S. economic sanctions. From time to time, certain of our subsidiaries have limited business dealings with countries subject to these sanctions, including Iran, Sudan, Syria, Russia and Cuba. These dealings represent an insignificant amount of our consolidated revenues and income but expose us to an increased risk of operating in these countries, including foreign exchange risks or restrictions or limitations on our ability to access funds generated in these jurisdictions, or the risk of violating applicable sanctions or regulations, which are complex and subject to frequent change. We have compliance programs in place, including policies, training and various forms of monitoring, designed to address the risks discussed above. Nonetheless, these programs and policies may not always protect us from conduct by individual employees that violate these laws. Violations or allegations of violations of these laws may result in large civil and criminal penalties, debarment or exclusion from participating in government programs, diversion of management time, attention and resources and may otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The laws and regulations discussed above are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations and changes, which may be violated unknowingly, could require us to incur substantial costs regarding compliance or to alter our sales and marketing practices and may subject us to enforcement actions or litigation which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot predict with certainty what laws, regulations and healthcare initiatives, if any, will be implemented, or what the ultimate effect of healthcare reform or any future legislation or regulation will have on us. For more information related to ongoing government investigations, see Note 7 in Item 8 of this Annual Report. For more information on regulatory matters currently affecting us, including quality-related matters, see “Certain Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of this Annual Report.16Increasing regulatory focus on privacy and security issues and expanding laws could impact our business and expose us to increased liability.As a global company, we are subject to global data privacy and security laws, regulations and codes of conduct that apply to our businesses. We are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing legal and regulatory requirements that govern the collection, use, storage, security, transfer, disclosure and other processing of personal data in the United States and in other countries, including, but not limited to, The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as amended (HIPAA), The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The GDPR imposes stringent European Union data protection requirements and provides for significant penalties for noncompliance. HIPAA also imposes stringent data privacy and security requirements and the regulatory authority has imposed significant fines and penalties on organizations found to be out of compliance. CCPA provides consumers with a private right of action against companies who have a security breach due to lack of appropriate security measures. We or our third-party providers and business partners may also be subjected to audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to compliance with information security and privacy laws and regulations, and noncompliance with the laws and regulations could result in substantial and material fines or class action litigation. If reimbursement or other payment for our current or future products is reduced or modified in the United States or in foreign countries, including through the implementation or repeal of government-sponsored healthcare reform or other similar actions, cost containment measures, or changes to policies with respect to pricing, taxation or rebates, our business could suffer.Sales of our products depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our products are paid by both public and private payers. These payers include Medicare, Medicaid, and private healthcare insurers in the United States and foreign governments and third-party payers outside the United States. Our work with government payers carries various risks inherent in working with government entities and agencies, including government reporting and auditing, additional regulatory oversight, mandated contractual terms, failure of government appropriations or other complex procedural requirements.Public and private payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. We may continue to experience downward pricing pressures from any or all of these payers which could result in an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operational results. Global efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing. Governments around the world use various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures, such as price controls, the formation of public contracting authorities, product formularies, which are lists of recommended or approved products, and competitive tenders which require the submission of a bid to sell products. Sales of our products are dependent, in part, on the availability of reimbursement by government agencies and healthcare programs, as well as insurance companies and other private payers. In much of Europe, Latin America, Asia and Australia, the government provides healthcare at low cost to patients, and controls its expenditures by purchasing products through public tenders, collective purchasing, regulating prices, setting reference prices in public tenders or limiting reimbursement or patient access to certain products. For example, China has been implementing volume-based procurement policies, a series of centralized reforms being instituted in China on both a national and regional basis that has resulted in significant price cuts for pharmaceuticals and medical consumables. Additionally, austerity measures or other reforms by foreign governments may limit, reduce or eliminate payments for our products and adversely affect both pricing flexibility and demand for our products. In addition, our recent acquisition of Hillrom has increased our exposure to risks related to reimbursement (as certain portions of that business directly bill various government agencies).The Healthcare Reform Act includes several provisions which impact our businesses in the United States, including increased Medicaid rebates and an expansion of the 340B Drug Pricing Program which provides certain qualified entities with discounts on the purchase of drugs for outpatient use and an excise tax on the sale of certain drugs. The Healthcare Reform Act reduces Medicare and Medicaid payments to hospitals and other providers, which may cause us to experience downward pricing pressure. Certain portions of the Healthcare Reform Act could negatively impact the demand for our products, and therefore our results of operations and financial position. In 2019, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services launched a new kidney health initiative. The CMS published the final end stage renal disease Treatment Choices mandatory payment model (ETC) in 2020. The ETC launched in 30% of dialysis clinics across the country on January 1, 2021 and creates payment incentives for the 17greater use of home dialysis and kidney transplants for those new to and already on dialysis. CMS also announced the implementation of four voluntary payment models with the stated goal of helping healthcare providers reduce the cost and improve the quality of care for patients with late-stage chronic kidney disease and ESRD. CMS has stated these payment models are aimed to prevent or delay the need for dialysis and encourage kidney transplantation. CMS launched the program on January 1, 2022, at which time 85 entities (or potential customers) were enrolled as participants. These proposed regulatory changes in kidney health policy and reimbursement may substantially change the U.S. end stage renal disease market and could increase demand for our peritoneal dialysis products, necessitating significant multi-year capital expenditures in order to meet that demand. However, the impact of such changes and related expenses are difficult to estimate in advance.In addition, a substantial portion of our revenues is dependent on federal healthcare program reimbursement, and any disruptions in federal government operations, including a federal government shutdown or failure of the U.S. government to enact annual appropriations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, disruptions in federal government operations may negatively impact regulatory approvals and guidance that are important to our operations, and create uncertainty about the pace of upcoming healthcare regulatory developments or approvals.As a result of these and other measures, including future measures or reforms that cannot be predicted, reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive basis. Legislation and regulations affecting reimbursement for our products may change at any time and in ways that may be adverse to us. We cannot predict the impact of these pressures and initiatives, or any negative effects of any additional regulations that may affect our business. We could be subject to fines or damages and possible exclusion from participation in federal or state healthcare programs if we fail to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our business.Portions of our business are subject to stringent laws and regulations at the federal or state levels governing the participation of durable medical equipment suppliers and independent diagnostic testing facilities in federal and state healthcare programs. From time to time, the government seeks additional information related to our claims submissions, and in some instances government contractors perform audits of payments made to us under Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal healthcare programs. On occasion, these reviews identify overpayments for which we submit refunds. At other times, our own internal audits identify the need to refund payments. We believe the frequency and intensity of government audits and review processes has grown and we expect this will continue in the future, due to increased resources allocated to these activities at both the federal and state Medicaid level, and greater sophistication in data review techniques.In addition, our business contracts with foreign and U.S. federal, state and local government entities and is subject to specific rules, regulations and approvals applicable to government contractors. Our failure to comply with these could result in contract terminations, suspension or debarment from contracting with these entities, civil fines and damages, criminal prosecution and possible exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, as well as possible recoupment of any overpayments related to such violations. While we believe that our practices materially comply with applicable state and federal requirements, the requirements might be interpreted in a manner inconsistent with our interpretation. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, even if inadvertent, could have a material adverse impact on our business.If we are unable to protect our patents or other proprietary rights, or if we infringe the patents or other proprietary rights of others, our competitiveness and business prospects may be materially damaged.Patent and other proprietary rights are essential to our business. Our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain and enforce patents and licenses to patent rights, both in the United States and in other countries. We cannot guarantee that pending patent applications will result in issued patents, that patents issued or licensed will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, that our patents will not be found to be invalid or that the intellectual property rights of others will not prevent us from selling certain products or including key features in our products.The patent position of a healthcare company is often uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. Significant litigation concerning patents and products is pervasive in our industry. Patent claims include challenges to the coverage and validity of our patents on products or processes as well as allegations that our products infringe patents held by competitors or other third parties. An unfavorable litigation outcome in any of these types of cases could result in a loss of patent protection or the ability to market products, which could lead to a significant loss of 18sales, or otherwise materially affect future results of operations. We also rely on trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and know-how to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive positions. Third parties may know, discover or independently develop equivalent proprietary information or techniques, or they may gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our trade secrets to the public.Although our employees, consultants, parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners are generally subject to confidentiality or similar agreements to protect our confidential and proprietary information, these agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. To the extent that our employees, consultants, parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.Furthermore, our intellectual property, proprietary technology and sensitive company data is potentially vulnerable to loss, damage or misappropriation from system malfunction, computer viruses and unauthorized access to our data or misappropriation or misuse thereof by those with permitted access and other events. While we have invested to protect our intellectual property, confidential information and other data, and continue to work diligently in this area, there can be no assurance that our precautionary measures will prevent breakdowns, breaches, cyber incidents or other events. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.Changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities may have a negative impact on our operating results.Changes to the tax laws in the United States or other countries in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our operating results. For example, the Build Back Better framework, if enacted as proposed by President Biden, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, the outcome of various initiatives currently being undertaken by the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development could significantly impact how we allocate profits across multiple jurisdictions, which could adversely impact our global tax obligations. Taxing authorities audit us from time to time and may disagree with certain positions we have taken in respect of our tax liabilities. Our tax liabilities are affected by many factors, including the amounts we charge in intra-company transactions for inventory, services, licenses, funding and other items, which are subject to the use of assumptions and judgment. Because we operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States, cross border transactions among our affiliates are a significant part of the manner in which we operate. Although we believe that we transact intra-company business in accordance with arm's-length principles, tax authorities may disagree with our intra-company charges, cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters, and may assess additional taxes as a result, including in connection with their review of the restated financial statements we have filed as part of our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. However, we may not accurately predict the outcome of these audits and, as a result, the actual outcome of these audits may have an adverse impact on our financial results. For more information on ongoing audits, see Note 12 in Item 8 of this Annual Report.We are party to a number of pending lawsuits and other disputes which may have an adverse impact on our business, operations or financial condition.We are party to a number of pending lawsuits, settlement discussions, mediations, arbitrations and other disputes, including for example, the Superfund cases, opioid litigation, ethylene oxide litigation, Linet antitrust litigation and a stockholder request for inspection of our books and records related to the restatement of certain of our financial statements, as set forth in Note 7 in Item 8 of this Annual Report. In addition, in the future we may be party to additional lawsuits, disputes or other matters, including patent, product liability or other lawsuits. These current and future matters may result in a loss of patent protection, reduced revenue, incurrence of significant liabilities and diversion of our management’s time, attention and resources. Given the uncertain nature of litigation and other disputes generally, we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in our current matters. In view of these uncertainties, the outcome of these current matters may result in charges in excess of any established reserves, and, to the extent available, liability insurance. We also continue to be self-insured with respect to product liability claims. The absence of third-party insurance coverage for current or future claims increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims and adverse decisions. Protracted litigation and other disputes, including any adverse outcomes, may have an adverse impact on our business, 19operations or financial condition. Even claims without merit could subject us to adverse publicity and require us to incur significant legal fees. Risks Related to the Economy and Our Financial Performance Current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect our business and financial condition.Our ability to generate cash flows from operations could be affected if there is a material decline in the demand for our products, in the solvency of our customers or suppliers, or deterioration in our key financial ratios or credit ratings. Current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of our customers (including governments) to pay for our products and services, and the amount spent on healthcare generally, which could result in decreased demand for our products and services, declining cash flows, longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. These conditions may also adversely affect certain of our suppliers, which could disrupt our ability to produce products. We continue to do business with foreign governments in certain countries, including Greece and Italy, which have experienced deterioration in credit and economic conditions. While global economic conditions have not significantly impacted our ability to collect receivables, liquidity issues in certain countries have resulted, and may continue to result, in delays in the collection of receivables and credit losses, and may also impact the stability of the U.S. dollar, Euro or Yuan. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and liquidity.We generate the majority of our revenue and profit outside the United States. As a result, our financial results have been and may in the future be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or our ability to mitigate these risks. We may experience additional volatility as a result of inflationary pressures and other macroeconomic factors, including in emerging market countries. We are also exposed to changes in interest rates, and our ability to access the money markets and capital markets could be impeded if market conditions are not favorable. For more information see “Financial Instrument Market Risk” in Item 7 of this Annual Report. Our operating results and financial condition may fluctuate.Our operating results and financial condition may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year for a number of reasons. Events, such as a delay in product development, changes to our expectations or strategy or even a relatively small revenue shortfall or increase in supply chain or other costs may cause financial results for a period to be below our expectations or projections. As a result, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful, nor should they be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our operating results and financial condition are also subject to fluctuation from all of the risks described throughout this section. These fluctuations may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and our stock price.We may not achieve our financial goals.We continue to evaluate and refine both our short-term and long-term financial objectives, including our stated commitment to achieve certain net leverage targets after completion of the Hillrom acquisition. Our ability to achieve these targets depends, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition (and related cost and revenue synergy targets) while continuing to strengthen our portfolio and extend our impact through transformative innovation. We may fail to achieve our targeted financial results if we are unsuccessful in implementing our strategies, our estimates or assumptions change or for any other reason. Our failure to achieve our financial goals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Future material impairments in the value of our long-lived assets, including goodwill, could negatively affect our operating results.We regularly review our long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets, goodwill (which results from our acquisition activity) and property, plant and equipment, for impairment. Goodwill and acquired indefinite life intangible assets are subject to impairment review on an annual basis and whenever potential impairment indicators are present. Other long-lived assets are reviewed when there is an indication that impairment may have occurred. Changes in market conditions or other changes in the future outlook of value may lead to impairment charges in the 20future. In addition, we may from time to time sell assets that we determine are not critical to our strategy, including in connection with strategic exits. Future events or decisions may lead to asset impairments and/or related charges. Certain non-cash impairments may result from a change in our strategic goals, business direction or other factors relating to the overall business environment. Material impairment charges could negatively affect our results of operations. For more information on the valuation and impairment of long-lived assets, see “Critical Accounting Policies” in Item 7 of this Annual Report"
13,BAX,BAXTER INTERNATIONAL INC,2021-02-11,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
.  In addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, stockholders or prospective investors should carefully consider the following risk factors. If any of the events described below occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, future growth prospects and stock price could suffer.Risks Related to the COVID-19 PandemicThe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have had, and we expect will continue to have, a material adverse effect on our business. The nature and extent of future impacts are uncertain and unpredictable.Our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises, including epidemics and pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 has had, and we expect will continue to have, an adverse impact on our operations, supply chains and distribution systems and has increased and will continue to increase our expenses, including the impact associated with preventive and precautionary measures that we, other businesses and governments are taking. These measures have led to unprecedented restrictions on, disruptions in, and other related impacts on businesses and personal activities. In addition to travel restrictions put in place in early 2020, governments have closed borders, imposed prolonged quarantines and may continue those measures or implement other restrictions and requirements in light of the continuing spread of the pandemic. We expect that these evolving restrictions and requirements, as well as the corresponding need to adapt to new methods of conducting business remotely, will continue to have an adverse effect on our business. Risks associated with COVID-19 include, but are not limited to, the following:•We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, significant and unpredictable reductions or increases in demand for certain of our products as healthcare customers re-prioritize the treatment of 6patients. Some of our products are particularly sensitive to reductions in elective medical procedures, and, as hospital systems prioritize treatment of COVID-19 patients and otherwise comply with government guidelines, many of those procedures have been suspended or postponed in our principal markets. In the second, third and fourth quarters of 2020, this resulted in lower levels of general hospital admissions and elective surgery volumes in those markets, which negatively impacted the demand for certain of our products. It is not possible to predict the timing of a broad resumption of elective medical procedures. If patients and hospital systems continue to de-prioritize, delay or cancel these procedures, our business, financial condition and results of operations would continue to be negatively affected.•A significant number of our suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and vendors have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, including with respect to the ability of their employees to get to their places of work and maintain the continuity of their on-site operations. These impacts could impair our ability to move our products through distribution channels to end customers. Any delay or shortage in the supply of components or materials or other operational or logistical challenges may result in our inability to satisfy consumer demand for our products in a timely manner or at all, which could harm our reputation, future sales and profitability. For example, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience supply constraints for amino acid raw materials used in our parenteral nutrition products, as such materials are also being used to produce COVID-19 vaccines. •We could experience a loss of sales and profitability due to delayed payments, reduced demand or insolvency of healthcare professionals, hospitals and other customers, and suppliers and vendors facing liquidity or other financial issues. These liquidity or other financial issues could be exacerbated if prolonged high levels of unemployment or loss of insurance coverage impact patients’ ability to access treatments that use our products and services.•COVID-19 could adversely impact our ability to retain key employees and the continued service and availability of skilled personnel necessary to run our operations, including members of our management, as well as the ability of our suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and vendors to retain their key employees. To the extent our management or other personnel are impacted in significant numbers by COVID-19 and are not available to perform their professional duties, we could experience delays in, or the suspension of, our manufacturing operations, research and development activities and other functions.•We face increased operational challenges as we continue to take measures to support and protect employee health and safety, including through office closures and work from home policies. For example, remote working arrangements heighten our risks associated with information technology systems and networks, including cyber-attacks, computer viruses, malicious software, security breaches, and telecommunication failures, both for systems and networks we control directly and for those that employees and third-party developers rely on to work remotely. Any failure to prevent or mitigate security breaches or cyber risks or detect, or respond adequately to, a security breach or cyber risk, or any other disruptions to our information technology systems and networks (as a result of remote working arrangements or otherwise), can have adverse effects on our business and cause reputational and financial harm. These risks are particularly heightened due to COVID‑19 as cybercriminals attempt to profit from the disruptions caused by the uncertain environment.•COVID-19 and related impacts have affected and may further affect the global economy and capital markets worldwide, which, among other consequences, may restrict our access to capital, increase financing costs, adversely affect our liquidity, the perceptions of our creditworthiness, and our ability to complete acquisitions, and increase volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.7The extent of the impact from the pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be predicted at this time, such as the severity and duration of the pandemic (including of related resurgences and future mutations or outbreaks of related strains of the virus); the extent and effectiveness of containment efforts, including the effectiveness and acceptance of any vaccines for COVID-19; and the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on our employees, customers, counterparties, service providers and regulators, as well as other market participants. Any of these and other impacts of the pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Finally, to the extent COVID-19 adversely affects our operations and global economic conditions more generally, many of the other risks described in this “Risk Factors
” section may be heightened. Risks Related to Our Ability to Grow Our BusinessIf we are unable to successfully introduce new products or fail to keep pace with advances in technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.We need to successfully introduce new products to achieve our strategic business objectives. Product development requires substantial investment and there is inherent risk in the R&D process. A successful product development process depends on many factors, including our ability to properly anticipate and satisfy customer needs, adapt to new technologies, obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis, demonstrate satisfactory clinical results, manufacture products in an economical and timely manner and differentiate our products from those of our competitors. If we cannot successfully introduce new products or adapt to changing technologies, our products may become obsolete and our revenue and profitability could suffer. Issues with product supply or quality could have an adverse effect on our business or cause a loss of customer confidence in us or our products, among other negative consequences.Our success depends upon the availability and quality of our products. The pharmaceutical and medical products industries are competitive and subject to complex market dynamics and varying demand levels. These levels vary in response to macro-economic conditions, regulatory requirements (including the availability of private or public reimbursement), seasonality, natural disasters, pandemics, epidemics and other matters. For example, as hospital systems prioritized treatment of COVID-19 patients, elective medical procedures were suspended or postponed in our principal markets, which negatively impacted demand for certain products. Additionally, the development of new or enhanced products involves a lengthy regulatory process and is capital intensive. As a result, our ability to match our production levels and capacity to market demand is imprecise and may result in a failure to meet market demand or satisfy customer requirements for our products or, alternatively, an oversupply of inventory. Failure to meet market demand may result in customers transitioning to available competitive products, loss of market share, negative publicity, reputational damage, loss of customer confidence or other negative consequences (including a decline in stock price). In the event of an oversupply, we may be forced to lower our prices, record asset impairment charges or take other actions, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our success also depends on our ability to maintain and routinely improve product quality and our quality management program. Quality management plays an essential role in meeting customer requirements, preventing defects, improving our products and services and assuring the safety and efficacy of our products. While we have a quality system that covers the lifecycle of our products, quality and safety issues have and may in the future occur with respect to our products. New or unintended uses of our product (for example, in response to COVID-19 or changing clinical practice) may also raise quality or safety issues. A quality or safety issue may result in adverse inspection reports, voluntary or official action indicated, warning letters, import bans, product recalls (either voluntary or required by FDA or similar governmental authorities in other countries) or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, costly litigation, refusal of a government to grant approvals and licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. See “—Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters.” An inability to address a quality or safety issue in an effective and timely manner may also cause negative publicity, a loss of customer confidence in us or our current or future products, which may result in the loss of sales and difficulty in successfully launching new products. Additionally, we have made and continue to make significant investments in assets, including inventory and property, plant and equipment, which relate to potential new products or modifications to existing products. Product quality or safety issues may restrict us from being able to realize the expected returns from these investments, potentially resulting in asset impairments in the future.8Unaffiliated third-party suppliers provide a number of goods and services to our R&D, clinical and manufacturing organizations. Third party suppliers are required to comply with our quality standards. Failure of a third-party supplier to provide compliant raw materials or supplies could result in delays, service interruptions or other quality related issues that may negatively impact our business results.There is substantial competition in the product markets in which we operate.Although no single company competes with us in all of our businesses, we face substantial competition in all of our markets from international and domestic healthcare and pharmaceutical companies and providers of all sizes, and these competitors often differ across our businesses. Competition is primarily focused on cost-effectiveness, price, service, product performance, and technological innovation.Competition may increase further as additional companies begin to enter our markets or modify their existing products to compete directly with ours. If our competitors respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or we do not introduce new versions or upgrades to our product portfolio in response to those requirements, our products may be rendered obsolete or non-competitive. If our competitors develop more effective or affordable products or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than we do, our business, financial condition and operations will likely be negatively affected. If we are forced to reduce our prices due to increased competition, our business could become less profitable. Our sales could be adversely affected if any of our contracts with GPOs, IDNs or other customers are terminated due to increased competition or otherwise.In addition, many health care industry companies, including health care systems, distributors, manufacturers, providers, and insurers, are consolidating or have formed strategic alliances. As the health care industry consolidates, competition to provide goods and services to industry participants will become more intense. Further, this consolidation creates larger enterprises with greater negotiating power, which they can use to negotiate price concessions. If we face an increase in costs or must reduce our prices because of industry consolidation, or if we lose customers as a result of consolidation, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. If our business development activities are unsuccessful, we may not realize the intended benefits.We expect to continue to engage in business development activities, including evaluating acquisitions, joint development opportunities, technology licensing arrangements and other opportunities. These activities may result in substantial investment of our resources. Our success developing products or expanding into new markets from such activities will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to find suitable opportunities for acquisition, investment or alliance; competition from other companies in the industries in which we operate that are seeking similar opportunities; whether we are able to complete an acquisition, investment or alliance on terms that are satisfactory to us; the strength of the other company’s underlying technology, products and ability to execute its business strategies; any intellectual property and litigation related to the other company’s products or technology; and our ability to successfully integrate the acquired company, business, product, technology or research into our existing operations, including the ability to adequately fund acquired in-process R&D projects and to maintain adequate controls over the combined operations. Certain of these activities are subject to antitrust and competition laws, which laws could impact our ability to pursue strategic transactions and could result in mandated divestitures in the context of proposed acquisitions. If we are unsuccessful in our business development activities, we may not realize the intended benefits of such activities, including that acquisition and integration costs may be greater than expected or the possibility that expected return on investment, synergies and accretion will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected timeframes.For more information on recent business development activities, see Note 2 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.If we fail to attract and retain key employees our business may suffer.Our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees, including people in senior management, sales, marketing, information technology and R&D positions. Competition for top talent in the 9healthcare industry can be intense. Our ability to recruit and retain such talent will depend on a number of factors, including hiring practices of our competitors, compensation and benefits, work location, work environment and industry economic conditions. If we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified employees, our business could suffer.Risks Related to Our Business Operations If we are unable to obtain sufficient components or raw materials on a timely basis or for a cost-effective price or if we experience other manufacturing, sterilization, supply or distribution difficulties, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.The manufacture of our products requires, among other things, the timely supply or delivery of sufficient amounts of quality components and materials. We manufacture our products in approximately 50 manufacturing facilities around the world. We acquire our components, materials and other requirements for manufacturing from many suppliers and vendors in various countries, including sometimes from ourselves for self-supplied requirements. We endeavor, either alone or working closely with our suppliers, to ensure the continuity of our inputs and supplies but we cannot guarantee these efforts will always be successful. Further, while efforts are made to diversify certain of our sources of components and materials, in certain instances there is only a sole source or supplier with no alternatives yet identified. For most of our components and materials for which a single source or supplier is used, alternative sources or suppliers may exist, but we have made a strategic determination to use the single source or supplier. Although we do carry strategic inventory and maintain insurance to help mitigate the potential risk related to any supply disruption, there can be no assurance that such measures will be sufficient or effective. A reduction or interruption in supply, an issue in the supply chain, including issues due to the revocation of distribution facilities’ licenses, and our inability to quickly develop acceptable alternative sources for such supply could adversely affect our ability to manufacture, distribute and sell our products in a timely or cost-effective manner. Moreover, changes in regulation, world trade policies, international taxes and government-to-government relations and issues with export and import activities could negatively impact our ability to distribute products within a country and across countries. See “—Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters.” Additionally, volatility in our costs of energy, transportation/freight, components, raw materials and other supply, manufacturing and distribution costs could adversely affect our results of operations. Climate change (including laws or regulations passed in response thereto) could increase our costs, in particular our costs of supply, energy and transportation/freight. Material or sustained increases in the price of oil could have an adverse impact on the cost of many of the plastic materials we use to make and package our products, as well as our transportation/freight costs. These outcomes may in turn result in customers transitioning to available competitive products, loss of market share, negative publicity, reputational damage, loss of customer confidence or other negative consequences (including a decline in stock price).Many of our products are difficult to manufacture. This is due to the complex nature of manufacturing pharmaceuticals, including biologics, and devices, as well as the strict regulatory regime governing our manufacturing operations. Variations in the manufacturing process may result in production failures which could lead to launch delays, product shortage, unanticipated costs, lost revenues and damage to our reputation. A failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers may also result in a quality or safety issue of the type discussed above.Some of our products are manufactured at a single manufacturing facility or stored at a single storage site. Loss or damage to, or closure of, a manufacturing facility or storage site due to a natural disaster, such as we experienced as a result of Hurricane Maria, a pandemic, such as COVID-19, or otherwise could adversely affect our ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of key products or deliver products to meet customer demand or contractual requirements, which may result in a loss of revenue and other adverse business consequences (including those identified in the paragraphs above). In addition, several of our manufacturing facilities are leased and we may not be able to renew leases on favorable terms or at all. Because of the time required to approve and license a manufacturing facility, a third-party manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis (if at all) to replace production capacity in the event we lose manufacturing capacity or products are otherwise unavailable. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Some of our products require sterilization prior to sale or distribution, and we utilize both Baxter-owned and third-party facilities for this process. If an event occurs that results in damage to or closure, whether temporarily or permanent, of one or more of these facilities, we may be unable to manufacture or sterilize the relevant products at prior levels or at all, and a third party may not be available on a timely basis (if at all) to replace sterilization capacity. 10For example, in February 2020, certain air emission control technology used to reduce ethylene oxide emissions from sterilization equipment at our facility in Mountain Home, Arkansas, was tested and determined not to operate in accordance with applicable emission limitations in our state-issued air permit. Although we received a temporary variance and have recommenced operations, these events or other disruptions of manufacturing or sterilization processes that we or third parties may experience, whether due to lack of capacity, environmental, regulatory or compliance issues or otherwise, could result in product shortage, unanticipated costs, loss of revenues, litigation and damage to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Breaches and breakdowns affecting our information technology systems or protected data, including from cyber security breaches and data leakage, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, reputation and competitive position.We rely upon information technology systems and infrastructure, including support provided by our partners and third parties, to support our business, our products and our customers. For example, we routinely rely on our technology systems and infrastructure to aid us in the collection, use, storage and transfer, disclosure and other processing of voluminous amounts of data including confidential, business, financial, personal, patient and other sensitive information (collectively, Confidential Information). We also rely on systems for manufacturing, customer orders, shipping, regulatory compliance and various other matters. Certain of our products and systems collect data regarding patients and their therapy and some are internet enabled or connect to our systems for maintenance and other purposes. Some of our products, even though not internet enabled nor connected to our systems, connect to hospital networks, electronic medical records or electronic health records. The continuing evolution of technology we use, including cloud-based computing, and reliance on third parties creates additional opportunities for the unintentional, intentional and/or unauthorized exposure, dissemination and/or destruction of Confidential Information stored in our devices, systems, servers, infrastructure and products (collectively, Technology). Security threats, including cyber and other attacks, are becoming increasingly sophisticated, frequent, and adaptive.Our Technology is vulnerable to breakdown, interruption, cyber and other security attacks, system malfunction, unauthorized access, inadvertent exposure or disclosure of information, theft and other events. Third-party systems that we rely upon could also become vulnerable to the same risks and may contain defects in design or manufacture or other problems that could result in system disruption or compromise the information security of our own systems. Any such vulnerability could compromise our Technology and could expose Confidential Information to unauthorized third parties and/or cause permanent loss of such data. In addition to loss of Confidential Information, unauthorized access to or interference with our Technology may cause product functionality issues that may result in risk to patient safety, field actions and/or product recalls. We have, like other large multi-national companies, experienced cyber incidents in the past and may experience them in the future, which have exposed and may continue to expose vulnerabilities in our information technology systems. Although the prior incidents have not had a material effect on our business and we have invested and continue to invest in the protection of data and Technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns, attacks, breaches in our Technology, cyber incidents or other incidents or ensure compliance with all applicable security and privacy laws, regulations and standards, including with respect to third-party service providers that host or process Confidential Information on our behalf. Such incidents could result in unauthorized access to patient data and other Confidential Information and could pose a risk to patient safety. Any failure to protect against such incidents can lead to substantial and material regulatory fines and penalties, business disruption, reputational harm, financial loss, litigation as well as other damages. Misappropriation or other loss of our intellectual property from any of the foregoing may have an adverse effect on our competitive position and may cause us to incur substantial litigation costs. See “—Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters.” As the FDA, other regulators and our customers become more sensitive to risks related to cybersecurity, our ability to meet certain information technology safety standards could affect our products’ marketability and competitiveness. We could also suffer strained relationships with customers, business partners, physicians and other healthcare professionals, increased costs (for security measures, remediation or otherwise), litigation (including class actions and stockholder derivative actions) or other negative consequences (including a decline in stock price) from breaches, cyber and other security attacks, industrial espionage, ransomware, email or phishing scams, malware or other cyber incidents, which may compromise our system infrastructure or lead to data leakage, either internally or at our third-party providers or other business partners.In addition, significant implementation issues may arise as we continue to consolidate and outsource certain computer operations and application support activities. Further, a greater number of our employees are working remotely in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and related government actions, which (among other things) could 11expose us to greater risks related to cybersecurity and our information technology systems. We also face all of the same risks listed above and other heightened risks when acquiring a company, in particular if we need to transition or implement certain processes or controls with the acquired company. We are subject to risks associated with doing business globally.Our operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business globally and under the laws, regulations and customs of various jurisdictions and geographies. These risks include changes in exchange controls and other governmental actions, loss of business in government and public tenders that are held annually in many cases, increasingly complex labor environments, availability of raw materials, changes in taxation, tariffs, export control restrictions, changes in or violations of U.S. or local laws, dependence on a few government entities as customers, pricing restrictions, economic and political instability, monetary or currency volatility or instability (including as it relates to the U.S. dollar, the Euro, the Yuan and currencies in emerging market countries), disputes between countries, trade relationships and conflicts, diminished or insufficient protection of intellectual property, and disruption or destruction of operations in a significant geographic region regardless of cause, including natural disaster, pandemic, power loss, cyber-attack, data breach, war, terrorism, riot, labor disruption, civil insurrection or social unrest. Failure to comply with, or material changes to, the laws and regulations that affect our global operations could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.On January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom (UK) formally left the European Union (EU) (commonly known as Brexit) when the UK-EU Withdrawal Agreement became effective. Under the Withdrawal Agreement, a transition period began that ran until December 31, 2020. On January 1, 2021, the UK left the EU Single Market and Customs Union, as well as all EU policies and international agreements. As a result, the free movement of persons, goods, services and capital between the UK and the EU ended, and the EU and the UK formed two separate markets and two distinct regulatory and legal spaces. On December 24, 2020, the European Commission reached a trade agreement with the UK on the terms of its future cooperation with the EU (Trade Agreement). The Trade Agreement offers UK and EU companies preferential access to each other’s markets, ensuring imported goods will be free of tariffs and quotas; however, economic relations between the UK and the EU will now be on more restricted terms than existed previously. The withdrawal by the UK from the EU could result in the deterioration of economic conditions, volatility in currency exchange rates, and increased regulatory complexities, as well as the potential for product shortages, increased costs or other similar effects. These outcomes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.The escalating global economic competition and trade tensions between the U.S. and China could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Although we have been able to mitigate some of the impact from increased duties imposed by both countries (through petitioning both governments for tariff exclusions and other mitigations), the risk remains of additional tariffs and other kinds of restrictions. Tariff exclusions awarded to us by the U.S. Government require annual renewal, and policies for granting exclusions could shift. The U.S. and China could impose other types of restrictions such as limitations on government procurement or technology export restrictions, which could affect our access to the markets. More generally, several governments including the U.S. have raised the possibility of policies to induce “re-shoring” of supply chains, less reliance on imported supplies, and greater national production. One example would be the stronger “Buy American” requirements in the U.S. (pursuant to a U.S. executive order by the new Administration on January 25, 2021) or U.S. withdrawal from the World Trade Organization Agreement on Government Procurement (GPA). If such steps triggered retaliation in other markets, such as by restricting access to foreign products in purchases by their government-owned healthcare systems, the outcomes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory MattersWe are subject to a number of laws and regulations, non-compliance with which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and we are susceptible to a changing regulatory environment.As a participant in the healthcare industry, our operations and products, and those of our customers, are regulated by numerous government agencies, both inside and outside the United States. The impact of this on us is direct to 12the extent we are subject to these laws and regulations, and indirect in that in a number of situations, even though we may not be directly regulated by specific healthcare laws and regulations, our products must be capable of being used by our customers in a manner that complies with those laws and regulations.The manufacture, distribution, marketing and use of our products are subject to extensive regulation and scrutiny by FDA and other regulatory authorities globally. Any new product must undergo lengthy and rigorous testing and other extensive, costly and time-consuming procedures mandated by FDA and foreign regulatory authorities. The same testing and procedures sometimes apply to current products that are up for authorization or renewal or are subject to changes in laws or regulations (for example certain of our medical devices will have to comply with the new European Union Medical Device Regulation when it enters into force in May 2021). Changes to current products may be subject to vigorous review, including additional 510(k) and other regulatory submissions, and approvals or the time needed to secure approvals are not certain. Our facilities must be approved and licensed prior to production and remain subject to inspection from time to time thereafter. Failure to comply with the requirements of FDA or other regulatory authorities, including a failed inspection or a failure in our adverse event reporting system, could result in adverse inspection reports, voluntary or official action indicated, warning letters, import bans, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, reputational damage, injunctions to halt the manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a government to grant approvals or licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. Any of these actions could cause a loss of customer confidence in us and our products, which could adversely affect our sales. The requirements of regulatory authorities, including interpretative guidance, are subject to change and compliance with additional or changing requirements or interpretative guidance may subject us to further review, result in product launch delays or otherwise increase our costs. For information on current regulatory issues affecting us, please refer to the caption entitled “Certain Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In connection with these issues, there can be no assurance that additional costs or civil and criminal penalties will not be incurred, that additional regulatory actions with respect to us will not occur, that we will not face civil claims for damages from purchasers or users, that substantial additional charges or significant asset impairments may not be required, that sales of other products may not be adversely affected, or that additional regulation will not be introduced that may adversely affect our operations and consolidated financial statements.The sales, marketing and pricing of products and relationships that pharmaceutical and medical device companies have with healthcare providers are under increased scrutiny by federal, state and foreign government agencies. Compliance with the Anti-Kickback Statute, False Claims Act, Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (including as these laws relate to off-label promotion of products) and other healthcare related laws, as well as competition, data and patient privacy and export and import laws, is under increased focus by the agencies charged with overseeing such activities, including FDA, OIG, DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission. The DOJ and the SEC have also increased their focus on the enforcement of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), particularly as it relates to the conduct of pharmaceutical and medical product companies. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their employees, contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Healthcare professionals in many countries are employed by the government and consequently may be considered government officials. Foreign governments have also increased their scrutiny of pharmaceutical and medical product companies’ sales and marketing activities and relationships with healthcare providers and competitive practices generally. The laws and standards governing the promotion, pricing, sale and reimbursement of our products and those governing our relationships with healthcare providers and governments, including the Sunshine Act enacted under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (as amended, the PPACA), can be complicated, are subject to frequent change and may be violated unknowingly.We are also subject to environmental laws, which are becoming more stringent throughout the world. For example, the EPA regulates the use of ethylene oxide for sterilization of medical devices, as is increasingly focused on reducing emissions from the ethylene oxide sterilization process, which has increased our costs of operations and necessitated changes to our manufacturing plants and processes. Other environmental laws may have similar consequences to us or our suppliers, or result in liability to us. The enactment of additional laws in the future may increase our compliance costs or otherwise adversely impact our operations.Additionally, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Control and the Bureau of Industry and Security at the U.S. Department of Commerce administer laws and regulations that restrict U.S. persons and, in some instances, non-U.S. persons, in conducting activities, transacting business or making investments in certain countries, or with governments, entities and individuals subject to U.S. economic sanctions. From time to time, 13certain of our subsidiaries have limited business dealings with countries subject to these sanctions, including Iran, Sudan, Syria, Russia and Cuba. These dealings represent an insignificant amount of our consolidated revenues and income but expose us to an increased risk of operating in these countries, including foreign exchange risks or restrictions or limitations on our ability to access funds generated in these jurisdictions, or the risk of violating applicable sanctions or regulations, which are complex and subject to frequent change. Additional restrictions may be enacted, enforced or interpreted in a way that may adversely affect our operations.We have compliance programs in place, including policies, training and various forms of monitoring, designed to address the risks discussed above. Nonetheless, these programs and policies may not always protect us from conduct by individual employees that violate these laws. Violations or allegations of violations of these laws may result in large civil and criminal penalties, debarment or exclusion from participating in government programs, diversion of management time, attention and resources and may otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For more information related to our ongoing government investigations, please refer to Note 7 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For more information on regulatory matters currently affecting us, including quality-related matters, refer to the discussion under the caption entitled “Certain Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.The laws and regulations discussed above are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or to alter one or more of our sales and marketing practices and may subject us to enforcement actions or litigation which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Increasing regulatory focus on privacy and security issues and expanding laws could impact our business and expose us to increased liability.As a global company, we are subject to global data privacy and security laws, regulations and codes of conduct that apply to our businesses. We are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing legal and regulatory requirements that govern the collection, use, storage, security, transfer, disclosure and other processing of personal data in the United States and in other countries, including, but not limited to, The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as amended (HIPAA), The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The GDPR imposes stringent European Union data protection requirements and provides for significant penalties for noncompliance. HIPAA also imposes stringent data privacy and security requirements and the regulatory authority has imposed significant fines and penalties on organizations found to be out of compliance. CCPA provides consumers with a private right of action against companies who have a security breach due to lack of appropriate security measures. We or our third-party providers and business partners may also be subjected to audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to compliance with information security and privacy laws and regulations, and noncompliance with the laws and regulations could result in substantial and material fines or class action litigation. If reimbursement or other payment for our current or future products is reduced or modified in the United States or in foreign countries, including through the implementation or repeal of government-sponsored healthcare reform or other similar actions, cost containment measures, or changes to policies with respect to pricing, taxation or rebates, our business could suffer.Sales of our products depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our products are paid by both public and private payers. These payers include Medicare, Medicaid, and private healthcare insurers in the United States and foreign governments and third-party payers outside the United States. Our work with government payers carries various risks inherent in working with government entities and agencies, including government reporting and auditing, additional regulatory oversight, mandated contractual terms, failure of government appropriations or other complex procedural requirements.Public and private payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. We may continue to experience downward pricing pressures from any or all of these payers which could result in an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operational results. 14Global efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing. Governments around the world use various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures, such as price controls, the formation of public contracting authorities, product formularies, which are lists of recommended or approved products, and competitive tenders which require the submission of a bid to sell products. Sales of our products are dependent, in part, on the availability of reimbursement by government agencies and healthcare programs, as well as insurance companies and other private payers. In much of Europe, Latin America, Asia and Australia, for example, the government provides healthcare at low cost to patients, and controls its expenditures by purchasing products through public tenders, collective purchasing, regulating prices, setting reference prices in public tenders or limiting reimbursement or patient access to certain products. Additionally, austerity measures or other reforms by foreign governments may limit, reduce or eliminate payments for our products and adversely affect both pricing flexibility and demand for our products.The PPACA includes several provisions which impact our businesses in the United States, including increased Medicaid rebates and an expansion of the 340B Drug Pricing Program which provides certain qualified entities, such as hospitals serving disadvantaged populations, with discounts on the purchase of drugs for outpatient use and an excise tax on the sale of certain drugs. The PPACA reduces Medicare and Medicaid payments to hospitals and other providers, which may cause us to experience downward pricing pressure. Certain portions of the PPACA could negatively impact the demand for our products, and therefore our results of operations and financial position. There have been multiple attempts to repeal or amend the PPACA through legislative action and legal challenges, and the most recent challenge is currently before the U.S. Supreme Court. Recent changes to the composition of the Supreme Court may increase the likelihood that the PPACA is repealed or impacted in some manner. In the event the PPACA is repealed or significantly altered, it would impact our business in a number of ways, some of which may be material.Following a 2019 executive order from former President Donald Trump, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced the launch of a new kidney health initiative. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) published the final end stage renal disease Treatment Choices mandatory payment model (ETC) on September 18, 2020. The ETC launched in 30% of dialysis clinics across the country on January 1, 2021 and creates payment incentives for the greater use of home dialysis and kidney transplants for those already on dialysis. CMS also announced the implementation of four voluntary payment models with the stated goal of helping healthcare providers reduce the cost and improve the quality of care for patients with late-stage chronic kidney disease and ESRD. CMS has stated these payment models are aimed to prevent or delay the need for dialysis and encourage kidney transplantation. These voluntary payment models have a scheduled commencement date of April 2021, but applicants now have the option to delay implementation until January 2022. These proposed regulatory changes in kidney health policy and reimbursement may substantially change the U.S. end stage renal disease market and could increase demand for our peritoneal dialysis products, necessitating significant multi-year capital expenditures in order to meet that demand. However, the impact of such changes and related expenses are difficult to estimate in advance.In addition, a substantial portion of our revenues is dependent on federal healthcare program reimbursement, and any disruptions in federal government operations, including a federal government shutdown or failure of the U.S. government to enact annual appropriations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, disruptions in federal government operations may negatively impact regulatory approvals and guidance that are important to our operations, and create uncertainty about the pace of upcoming healthcare regulatory developments or approvals.As a result of these and other measures, including future measures or reforms that cannot be predicted, reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive basis. Legislation and regulations affecting reimbursement for our products may change at any time and in ways that may be adverse to us. We cannot predict the impact of these pressures and initiatives, or any negative effects of any additional regulations that may affect our business. 15If we are unable to protect our patents or other proprietary rights, or if we infringe the patents or other proprietary rights of others, our competitiveness and business prospects may be materially damaged.Patent and other proprietary rights are essential to our business. Our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain and enforce patents and licenses to patent rights, both in the United States and in other countries. We cannot guarantee that pending patent applications will result in issued patents, that patents issued or licensed will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, that our patents will not be found to be invalid or that the intellectual property rights of others will not prevent us from selling certain products or including key features in our products.The patent position of a healthcare company is often uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. Significant litigation concerning patents and products is pervasive in our industry. Patent claims include challenges to the coverage and validity of our patents on products or processes as well as allegations that our products infringe patents held by competitors or other third parties. An unfavorable litigation outcome in any of these types of cases could result in a loss of patent protection or the ability to market products, which could lead to a significant loss of sales, or otherwise materially affect future results of operations. We also rely on trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and know-how to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive positions. Third parties may know, discover or independently develop equivalent proprietary information or techniques, or they may gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our trade secrets to the public.Although our employees, consultants, parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners are generally subject to confidentiality or similar agreements to protect our confidential and proprietary information, these agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. To the extent that our employees, consultants, parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.Furthermore, our intellectual property, other proprietary technology and other sensitive company data is potentially vulnerable to loss, damage or misappropriation from system malfunction, computer viruses, unauthorized access to our data or misappropriation or misuse thereof by those with permitted access and other events. While we have invested to protect our intellectual property, confidential information and other data, and continue to work diligently in this area, there can be no assurance that our precautionary measures will prevent breakdowns, breaches, cyber incidents or other events. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.Misappropriation or other loss of our intellectual property from any of the foregoing would have an adverse effect on our competitive position and may cause us to incur substantial litigation costs. Changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities may have a negative impact on our operating results.Changes to the tax laws in the United States or other countries in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our operating results. In particular, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and the regulations issued thereunder (collectively, 2017 Tax Act), including, among other things, certain changes in tax rates, deductibility of interest, deductibility of executive compensation expense, expensing of capital expenditures, the ability to use certain tax credits, taxation on earnings from international business operations, and the treatment of deductible payments made by our U.S. affiliates to our foreign affiliates could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In certain instances, the 2017 Tax Act could have a negative effect on our tax rate and the carrying value of tax balances. Any of these changes could adversely affect our financial performance. There remains some uncertainty regarding aspects of the implementation of the 2017 Tax Act that could potentially have adverse impacts on us. We cannot currently predict the full impact that the 2017 Tax Act may have over time on our business, including revenues, profit margins, profitability, operating cash flows and results of operations. For more information regarding the impact of the 2017 Tax Act, see Note 12 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Similarly, the outcome of various initiatives currently being undertaken by the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development could significantly impact how we allocate profits across multiple jurisdictions, which could adversely impact our global tax obligations. 16Taxing authorities audit us from time to time and may disagree with certain positions we have taken in respect of our tax liabilities. Our tax liabilities are affected by many factors, including the amounts we charge in intra-company transactions for inventory, services, licenses, funding and other items, which are subject to the use of assumptions and judgment. Because we operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States, cross border transactions among our affiliates are a significant part of the manner in which we operate. Although we believe that we transact intra-company business in accordance with arm's-length principles, tax authorities may disagree with our intra-company charges, cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters, and may assess additional taxes as a result, including in connection with their review of the restated financial statements we have filed as part of our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K.We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. However, we may not accurately predict the outcome of these audits and, as a result, the actual outcome of these audits may have an adverse impact on our financial results. For more information on ongoing audits, see Note 12 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We are party to a number of pending lawsuits and other disputes which may have an adverse impact on our business, operations or financial condition.We are party to a number of pending lawsuits, settlement discussions, mediations, arbitrations and other disputes. In addition, in the future we may be party to such disputes, including patent, product liability or other lawsuits. These current and future matters may result in a loss of patent protection, reduced revenue, incurrence of significant liabilities and diversion of our management’s time, attention and resources. Given the uncertain nature of litigation and other disputes generally, we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in these current matters. In view of these uncertainties, the outcome of these matters may result in charges in excess of any established reserves, and, to the extent available, liability insurance. We also continue to be self-insured with respect to product liability claims. The absence of third-party insurance coverage for current or future claims increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims and adverse decisions. Protracted litigation and other disputes, including any adverse outcomes, may have an adverse impact on our business, operations or financial condition. Even claims without merit could subject us to adverse publicity and require us to incur significant legal fees. See Note 7 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding current lawsuits.We identified certain misstatements to our previously issued financial statements and have restated the financial statements described below (the “restatement”), which has exposed us to a number of additional risks and uncertainties.As discussed in the Explanatory Note, in Note 2, Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements, and in Note 19, Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited) in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K, we restated certain of our previously issued audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements and selected financial information to correct misstatements of certain foreign exchange gains and losses from foreign currency denominated intra-company loan receivables and payables, cash balances and gains and losses from foreign currency derivative contracts, which we determined were material to these periods. As a result of the misstatements and the restatement, we have become subject to additional risks and uncertainties and costs, including as a result of a pending class-action lawsuit and a stockholder request for inspection of our books and records. As initially disclosed on October 24, 2019, we also voluntarily advised the staff of the SEC of our previously disclosed internal investigation and we are continuing to cooperate with the staff of the SEC. We may become subject to enforcement proceedings brought by the SEC or other regulatory or governmental authorities, or subject to other legal proceedings, as a result of the events leading to our internal investigation, the misstatements or the related restatement, and actions and proceedings could also be brought against our current and former employees, officers, or directors. These actions, lawsuits or other legal proceedings related to the misstatements or the restatement could result in reputational harm, additional defense and other costs, regardless of the outcome of the lawsuit or proceeding. If we do not prevail in any such lawsuit or proceeding, we could be subject to substantial damages or settlement costs, criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures, including, but not limited to, injunctive relief, disgorgement, civil and criminal fines and penalties. In addition, we continue to be at risk for loss of investor confidence, loss of key employees, changes in management or our board of directors and other reputational issues, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.17Risks Related to the Economy and Our Financial Performance Current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect our business and financial condition.Our ability to generate cash flows from operations could be affected if there is a material decline in the demand for our products, in the solvency of our customers or suppliers, or deterioration in our key financial ratios or credit ratings. Current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of our customers (including governments) to pay for our products and services, and the amount spent on healthcare generally. This could result in a decrease in the demand for our products and services, declining cash flows, longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. These conditions may also adversely affect certain of our suppliers, which could cause a disruption in our ability to produce our products. We continue to do business with foreign governments in certain countries, including Greece and Italy, which have experienced deterioration in credit and economic conditions. While global economic conditions have not significantly impacted our ability to collect receivables, liquidity issues in certain countries have resulted, and may continue to result, in delays in the collection of receivables and credit losses. These conditions may also impact the stability of the U.S. dollar, Euro or Yuan. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and liquidity.We generate the majority of our revenue and profit outside the United States. As a result, our financial results have been and may in the future be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or our ability to mitigate these risks. We may experience additional volatility as a result of inflationary pressures and other macroeconomic factors, including in emerging market countries. We are also exposed to changes in interest rates, and our ability to access the money markets and capital markets could be impeded if market conditions are not favorable. A discussion of the financial impact of foreign exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations, and the ways and extent to which we attempt to mitigate such impact is contained under the caption “Financial Instrument Market Risk” in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our operating results and financial condition may fluctuate.Our operating results and financial condition may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year for a number of reasons. Events, such as a delay in product development, changes to our expectations or strategy or even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause financial results for a period to be below our expectations or projections. As a result, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful, and these comparisons should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our operating results and financial condition are also subject to fluctuation from all of the risks described throughout this section. These fluctuations may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and our stock price.We may not achieve our financial goals.We continue to evaluate and refine both our short-term and long-term financial objectives. These include, for example, our stated objective to improve our gross margin. Our strategy to achieve these objectives is focused on strengthening our portfolio and extending our impact through transformative innovation that spans prevention to recovery. As part of this strategy, we intend to invest in portfolio innovation and market development and entering adjacencies while continuing to drive operational excellence through ongoing business transformation efforts and organization optimization. We will also look to unlock additional value through strategic capital deployment. We may fail to achieve our targeted financial results if we are unsuccessful in implementing our strategies, our estimates or assumptions change or for any other reason. Our failure to achieve our financial goals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. 18Future material impairments in the value of our long-lived assets, including goodwill, could negatively affect our operating results.We regularly review our long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets, goodwill (which results from our acquisition activity) and property, plant and equipment, for impairment. Goodwill and acquired indefinite life intangible assets are subject to impairment review on an annual basis and whenever potential impairment indicators are present. Other long-lived assets are reviewed when there is an indication that impairment may have occurred. Changes in market conditions or other changes in the future outlook of value may lead to impairment charges in the future. In addition, we may from time to time sell assets that we determine are not critical to our strategy, including in connection with strategic exits. Future events or decisions may lead to asset impairments and/or related charges. Certain non-cash impairments may result from a change in our strategic goals, business direction or other factors relating to the overall business environment. Material impairment charges could negatively affect our results of operations. For more information on the valuation and impairment of long-lived assets, refer to the discussion under the caption entitled “Critical Accounting Policies” in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. There could be significant liability if the separation and distribution or any Retained Shares Transaction is determined to be a taxable transaction. Baxalta has indemnified us for certain potential liabilities that may arise, and such indemnification obligation is guaranteed by Shire, but Baxalta and Shire may be unable to satisfy their indemnification obligations to us in the future.The separation and distribution and the Retained Shares Transactions (collectively, the Baxter Transactions) qualify for tax-free treatment to Baxter and its stockholders under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). Completion of the separation and distribution was conditioned upon, among other things, the receipt of a private letter ruling from the IRS regarding certain issues relating to the tax-free treatment of the Baxter Transactions. Although the IRS private letter ruling is generally binding on the IRS, the continuing validity of such ruling is subject to the accuracy of factual representations and assumptions made in the ruling. Completion of the distribution was also conditioned upon Baxter’s receipt of a tax opinion from KPMG LLP regarding certain aspects of the Baxalta separation not covered by the IRS private letter ruling. The opinion was based upon various factual representations and assumptions, as well as certain undertakings made by Baxter and Baxalta. If any of the factual representations or assumptions in the IRS private letter ruling or tax opinion is untrue or incomplete in any material respect, if any undertaking is not complied with, or if the facts upon which the IRS private letter ruling or tax opinion are based are materially different from the actual facts relating to the Baxter Transactions, the opinion or IRS private letter ruling may not be valid. Moreover, opinions of a tax advisor are not binding on the IRS. As a result, the conclusions expressed in the opinion of a tax advisor could be successfully challenged by the IRS.If the Baxter Transactions are determined to be taxable, Baxter and its stockholders could incur significant tax liabilities. Pursuant to the tax matters agreement, Baxalta agreed to indemnify us for certain tax-related losses incurred if Baxalta’s actions cause the separation and distribution and certain related transactions to fail to qualify for tax-free status under the applicable provisions of the Code.In anticipation of the merger between Baxalta and Shire (the Merger), we entered into a letter agreement with Shire and Baxalta (the Letter Agreement). Under the Letter Agreement, Baxalta agreed to indemnify, and Shire agreed to guarantee such indemnity to, Baxter and each of its affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors and employees against certain tax-related losses attributable to or resulting from (in whole or in part) the Merger as further described in the Letter Agreement. If the Baxter Transactions are determined to be taxable as a result (in whole or in part) of the Merger (for example, if the Merger is deemed to be part of a plan (or series of related transactions) that includes the Baxter Transactions), Baxter and its stockholders could incur significant tax liabilities. Although Baxalta and Shire may be required to indemnify Baxter under the tax matters agreement and the Letter Agreement for any such tax liabilities incurred by Baxter, there can be no assurance that the indemnity from Baxalta or the guarantee thereof by Shire will be sufficient to protect us against all or a part of the amount of such liabilities, or that either Baxalta or Shire will fully satisfy their respective obligations.Even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Baxalta or Shire any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be required to bear these costs initially, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.19"
11,BAX,BAXTER INTERNATIONAL INC,2020-03-17,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
.  In addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, stockholders or prospective investors should carefully consider the following risk factors. If any of the events described below occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, future growth prospects and stock price could suffer.If we are unable to successfully introduce new products or fail to keep pace with advances in technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.We need to successfully introduce new products to achieve our strategic business objectives. Product development requires substantial investment and there is inherent risk in the R&D process. A successful product development process depends on many factors, including our ability to properly anticipate and satisfy customer needs, adapt to new technologies, obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis, demonstrate satisfactory clinical results, manufacture products in an economical and timely manner and differentiate our products from those of our competitors. If we cannot successfully introduce new products or adapt to changing technologies, our products may become obsolete and our revenue and profitability could suffer.6Issues with product supply or quality could have an adverse effect on our business, subject us to regulatory actions, or cause a loss of customer confidence in us or our products, among other negative consequences.Our success depends upon the availability and quality of our products. The pharmaceutical and medical products industries are competitive and subject to complex market dynamics and varying demand levels. These levels vary in response to macro-economic conditions, regulatory requirements (including the availability of private or public reimbursement), seasonality, natural disasters, epidemics and other matters. Additionally, the development of new or enhanced products involves a lengthy regulatory process and is capital intensive. As a result, our ability to match our production levels and capacity to market demand is imprecise and may result in a failure to meet market demand or satisfy customer requirements for our products or, alternatively, an oversupply of inventory. Failure to meet market demand may result in customers transitioning to available competitive products, loss of market share, negative publicity, reputational damage, loss of customer confidence or other negative consequences (including a decline in stock price). In the event of an oversupply, we may be forced to lower our prices, record asset impairment charges or take other actions, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Additionally, quality management plays an essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements, preventing defects, improving our products and services and assuring the safety and efficacy of our products. Our future success depends on our ability to maintain and continuously improve our quality management program. While we have a quality system that covers the lifecycle of our products, quality and safety issues have and may in the future occur with respect to our products. A quality or safety issue may result in adverse inspection reports, voluntary or official action indicated, warning letters, import bans, product recalls (either voluntary or required by FDA or similar governmental authorities in other countries) or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, costly litigation, refusal of a government to grant approvals and licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. An inability to address a quality or safety issue in an effective and timely manner may also cause negative publicity, a loss of customer confidence in us or our current or future products, which may result in the loss of sales and difficulty in successfully launching new products. Additionally, Baxter has made and continues to make significant investments in assets, including inventory and property, plant and equipment, which relate to potential new products or modifications to existing products. Product quality or safety issues may restrict us from being able to realize the expected returns from these investments, potentially resulting in asset impairments in the future.Unaffiliated third party suppliers provide a number of goods and services to our R&D, clinical and manufacturing organizations. Third party suppliers are required to comply with our quality standards. Failure of a third party supplier to provide compliant raw materials or supplies could result in delays, service interruptions or other quality related issues that may negatively impact our business results.For more information on regulatory matters currently affecting us, including quality-related matters, refer to the discussion under the caption entitled “Certain Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.If we are unable to obtain sufficient components or raw materials on a timely basis or for a cost-effective price or if we experience other manufacturing, sterilization or supply difficulties, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.The manufacture of our products requires, among other things, the timely supply or delivery of sufficient amounts of quality components and materials. We manufacture our products in approximately 50 manufacturing facilities around the world. We acquire our components, materials and other requirements for manufacturing from many suppliers and vendors in various countries, including sometimes from ourselves for self-supplied requirements. We endeavor, either alone or working closely with our suppliers, to ensure the continuity of our inputs and supplies but we cannot guarantee these efforts will always be successful. Further, while efforts are made to diversify certain of our sources of components and materials, in certain instances there is only a sole source or supplier with no alternatives yet identified. For most of our components and materials for which a single source or supplier is used, alternative sources or suppliers may exist, but we have made a strategic determination to use the single source or supplier. Although we do carry strategic inventory and maintain insurance to help mitigate the potential risk related to any related supply disruption, there can be no assurance that such measures will be sufficient or effective. A reduction or interruption in supply and an inability to quickly develop acceptable alternative sources for such supply, could adversely affect our ability to manufacture and distribute our products in a timely or cost-effective manner, and our ability to make product sales.  Additionally, volatility in our costs of energy, transportation/freight, components, raw materials and other supply, manufacturing and distribution costs could adversely affect our results of operations. Climate change (including laws or regulations passed in response thereto) could increase our costs, in particular our 7costs of supply, energy and transportation/freight. Material or sustained increases in the price of oil could have an adverse impact on the cost of many of the plastic materials we use to make and package our products, as well as our transportation/freight costs. These outcomes may in turn result in customers transitioning to available competitive products, loss of market share, negative publicity, reputational damage, loss of customer confidence or other negative consequences (including a decline in stock price).Many of our products are difficult to manufacture. This is due to the complex nature of manufacturing pharmaceuticals, including biologics, and devices, as well as the strict regulatory regime governing our manufacturing operations. Variations in the manufacturing process may result in production failures which could lead to launch delays, product shortage, unanticipated costs, lost revenues and damage to our reputation. A failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers may also result in a quality or safety issue of the type discussed above.Some of our products are manufactured at a single manufacturing facility or stored at a single storage site. Loss or damage to a manufacturing facility or storage site due to a natural disaster, such as we experienced as a result of Hurricane Maria, or otherwise could adversely affect our ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of key products or deliver products to meet customer demand or contractual requirements which may result in a loss of revenue and other adverse business consequences (including those identified in the paragraphs above). Our manufacturing capacity may also be adversely affected by public health crises and epidemics/pandemics, such as the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19), as a result of which we may be unable to obtain sufficient components or raw materials on a timely basis or at a cost-effective price. Although we have not experienced significant manufacturing or supply difficulties as a result of COVID-19, the degree and duration of disruptions to business activity are unknown at this time. In addition, several of our manufacturing facilities are leased and we may not be able to renew leases on favorable terms or at all. Because of the time required to approve and license a manufacturing facility, a third party manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis (if at all) to replace production capacity in the event we lose manufacturing capacity or products are otherwise unavailable. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Some of our products require sterilization prior to sale or distribution, and we utilize both Baxter-owned and third-party facilities for this process. If an event occurs that results in damage to or closure, whether temporarily or permanent, of one or more of these facilities, we may be unable to manufacture or sterilize the relevant products at prior levels or at all, and a third party may not be available on a timely basis (if at all) to replace sterilization capacity. For example, in February 2020, certain air emission control technology used to reduce ethylene oxide emissions from sterilization equipment at our facility in Mountain Home, Arkansas, was tested and determined not to operate in accordance with applicable emission limitations in our state-issued air permit. Although we received a temporary variance and have recommenced operations, these events or other disruptions of manufacturing or sterilization processes that we or third parties may experience, whether due to lack of capacity, environmental, regulatory or compliance issues or otherwise, could result in product shortage, unanticipated costs, loss of revenues, litigation and damage to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  We are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and subject to privacy and security laws, and our systems and infrastructure face certain risks, including from cyber security breaches and data leakage.We increasingly rely upon technology systems and infrastructure, including support provided by our partners and third parties, to support our business, our products and our customers.  For example, we routinely rely on our technology systems and infrastructure to aid us in the collection, use, storage and transfer, disclosure and other processing of voluminous amounts of data including confidential, business, financial, personal, patient and other sensitive information (collectively, Confidential Information). We also rely on systems for manufacturing, customer orders, shipping, regulatory compliance and various other matters. Certain of our products and systems collect data regarding patients and their therapy and some are internet enabled or connect to our systems for maintenance and other purposes.Additionally, the legal and regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the imposition of new and changing requirements across businesses. We are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing legal and regulatory requirements that govern the collection, use, storage, security, transfer, disclosure and other processing of personal data in the United States and in other countries, including, but not limited to, The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as amended, The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HIPAA), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).  The GDPR imposes stringent European Union data protection requirements and provides for significant penalties for noncompliance.  HIPAA also imposes 8stringent data privacy and security requirements and the regulatory authority has imposed significant fines and penalties on organizations found to be out of compliance. CCPA provides consumers with a private right of action against companies who have a security breach due to lack of appropriate security measures. We or our third-party providers and business partners may also be subjected to audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to compliance with information security and privacy laws and regulations, and noncompliance with the laws and regulations could result in substantial and material fines or class action litigation. The increasing use and evolution of technology, including cloud-based computing, and reliance on third parties creates additional opportunities for the unintentional, intentional and/or unauthorized exposure, dissemination and/or destruction of Confidential Information stored in our devices, systems, servers, infrastructure and products (collectively, Technology).  Security threats, including cyber and other attacks, are becoming increasingly sophisticated, frequent, and adaptive. Our Technology (and that of third parties that we use) is vulnerable to breakdown, interruption, cyber and other security attacks, system malfunction, unauthorized access, inadvertent exposure or disclosure of information, theft and other events. Any such vulnerability could compromise our Technology and could expose Confidential Information to unauthorized third parties and/or cause permanent loss of such data.  In addition to loss of Confidential Information, unauthorized access to or interference with our Technology may cause product functionality issues that may result in risk to patient safety, field actions and/or product recalls. We have, like other large multi-national companies, experienced cyber incidents in the past and may experience them in the future. Although the prior incidents have not had a material effect on our business and we have invested and continue to invest in the protection of data and Technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns, attacks, breaches in our Technology, cyber incidents or other incidents or ensure compliance with all applicable security and privacy laws, regulations and standards, including with respect to third party service providers that host or process Confidential Information on our behalf. Such incidents could result in unauthorized access to patient data and other Confidential Information and could pose a risk to patient safety. Any failure to protect against such incidents can lead to substantial and material regulatory fines and penalties, business disruption, reputational harm, financial loss, litigation as well as other damages.  Misappropriation or other loss of our intellectual property from any of the foregoing may have an adverse effect on our competitive position and may cause us to incur substantial litigation costs.  We could also suffer strained relationships with customers and business partners, increased costs (for security measures, remediation or otherwise), litigation (including class actions and stockholder derivative actions) or other negative consequences (including a decline in stock price) from breaches, cyber and other security attacks, industrial espionage, ransomware, email or phishing scams, malware or other cyber incidents, which may compromise our system infrastructure or lead to data leakage, either internally or at our third-party providers or other business partners.  In addition, significant implementation issues may arise as we continue to consolidate and outsource certain computer operations and application support activities. We also face all of the same risks listed above and other heightened risks when acquiring a company, in particular if we need to transition or implement certain processes or controls with the acquired company.We identified certain misstatements to our previously issued financial statements and have restated the financial statements described below, which has exposed us to a number of additional risks and uncertainties.As discussed in the Explanatory Note, in Note 2, Restatement of Previously Issued Consolidated Financial Statements, and in Note 19, Quarterly Financial Data (Unaudited) in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we restated our previously issued audited consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2018 and for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, unaudited interim financial information as of and for the quarterly periods ended June 30, 2019, March 31, 2019, December 31, 2018, June 30, 2018 and March 31, 2018, for the six months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018, and as of September 30, 2018 within the notes to the financial statements, and unaudited selected financial data as of December 31, 2017 and as of and for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 within Item 6, Selected Financial Data. In our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2019, we also restated our unaudited financial statements for the quarterly and year-to-date periods ended September 30, 2018. We concluded that these previous periods should be restated to correct misstatements of certain foreign exchange gains and losses from foreign currency denominated intra-company loan receivables and payables, cash balances and gains and losses from foreign currency derivative contracts, which we determined were material to these periods. The restatement also included corrections for certain items, including items that affect operating income and operating cash flows, that were immaterial, individually and in the aggregate, to our previously issued financial statements.As a result of the misstatements and the restatement, we have become subject to a number of additional risks and uncertainties and unanticipated costs for accounting, legal and other fees and expenses, including as a result of a 9pending class-action lawsuit and a stockholder request for inspection of our books and records. As initially disclosed on October 24, 2019, we also voluntarily advised the staff of the SEC of our previously disclosed internal investigation and we are continuing to cooperate with the staff of the SEC. We may become subject to enforcement proceedings brought by the SEC or other regulatory or governmental authorities, or subject to other legal proceedings, as a result of the events leading to our internal investigation, the misstatements or the related restatement, and actions and proceedings could also be brought against our current and former employees, officers, or directors.  These actions, lawsuits or other legal proceedings related to the misstatements or the restatement could result in reputational harm, additional defense and other costs, regardless of the outcome of the lawsuit or proceeding. If we do not prevail in any such lawsuit or proceeding, we could be subject to substantial damages or settlement costs, criminal and civil penalties and other remedial measures, including, but not limited to, injunctive relief, disgorgement, civil and criminal fines and penalties. In addition, we continue to be at risk for loss of investor confidence, loss of key employees, changes in management or our board of directors and other reputational issues, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.We identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. If we are unable to remediate the material weakness, or if we experience additional material weaknesses in the future, our business may be harmed.Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for evaluating and reporting on the effectiveness of our system of internal control. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. As a public company, we are required to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other rules that govern public companies. In particular, we are required to certify our compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires us to furnish annually a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm is required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.Management performed an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 and concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2019 due to the material weakness related to the accounting for certain foreign exchange gains and losses. Specifically, we did not have controls in place to monitor and quantify the difference between the foreign exchange gains and losses that we reported and the foreign exchange gains and losses that we would have reported using exchange rates determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Additionally, our policies and controls related to approvals and monitoring of intra-company transactions were insufficient to prevent or detect intra-company transactions undertaken solely for the purpose of generating foreign exchange gains or avoiding losses under our historical exchange rate convention.  We have taken and continue to take remedial steps to improve our internal control over financial reporting. For further discussion of the material weakness identified and our remedial efforts, see Item 9A, Controls and Procedures.Remediation efforts place a significant burden on management and add increased pressure to our financial resources and processes. If we are unable to successfully remediate our existing material weakness or any additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that may be identified in the future in a timely manner, the accuracy and timing of our financial reporting may be adversely affected; our liquidity, our access to capital markets, the perceptions of our creditworthiness and our ability to complete acquisitions may be adversely affected; we may be unable to maintain or regain compliance with applicable securities laws, the listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange and the covenants under our debt instruments or derivative arrangements regarding the timely filing of periodic reports; we may be subject to regulatory investigations and penalties; investors may lose confidence in our financial reporting; our reputation may be harmed; we may suffer defaults, accelerations or cross-accelerations under our debt instruments or derivative arrangements to the extent we are unable to obtain additional waivers from the required creditors or counterparties or are unable to cure any breaches; and our stock price may decline.Our failure to prepare and timely file our periodic reports with the SEC limits our access to the public markets to raise debt or equity capital. We did not file our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2019 within the timeframe required by the SEC; thus, we have not remained current in our reporting requirements with the SEC. Although we regained status as a current filer on March 17, 2020 by filing this Annual Report on Form 10-K (within 10the extended time period provided for by Rule 12b-25) and our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2019, we are not currently eligible to use a registration statement on Form S-3 that would allow us to continuously incorporate by reference our SEC reports into the registration statement, or to use “shelf” registration statements to conduct offerings, until approximately one year from the date we regained and maintain status as a current filer. If we wish to pursue an offering now, we would be required to conduct the offering on an exempt basis, such as in accordance with Rule 144A, or file a registration statement on Form S-1. Using a Form S-1 registration statement for a public offering would likely take significantly longer than using a registration statement on Form S-3 and increase our transaction costs, and could, to the extent we are not able to conduct offerings using alternative methods, adversely impact our ability to raise capital or complete acquisitions of other companies in a timely manner.We are subject to a number of existing laws and regulations, non-compliance with which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and we are susceptible to a changing regulatory environment.As a participant in the healthcare industry, our operations and products, and those of our customers, are regulated by numerous government agencies, both inside and outside the United States. The impact of this on us is direct to the extent we are subject to these laws and regulations, and indirect in that in a number of situations, even though we may not be directly regulated by specific healthcare laws and regulations, our products must be capable of being used by our customers in a manner that complies with those laws and regulations.The manufacture, distribution, marketing and use of our products are subject to extensive regulation and scrutiny by FDA and other regulatory authorities globally. Any new product must undergo lengthy and rigorous testing and other extensive, costly and time-consuming procedures mandated by FDA and foreign regulatory authorities. The same testing and procedures sometimes apply to current products that are up for authorization or renewal or are subject to changes in laws or regulations (for example certain of our medical devices will have to comply with the new European Union Medical Device Regulation). Changes to current products may be subject to vigorous review, including additional 510(k) and other regulatory submissions, and approvals or the time needed to secure approvals are not certain. Our facilities must be approved and licensed prior to production and remain subject to inspection from time to time thereafter. Failure to comply with the requirements of FDA or other regulatory authorities, including a failed inspection or a failure in our adverse event reporting system, could result in adverse inspection reports, voluntary or official action indicated, warning letters, import bans, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, reputational damage, injunctions to halt the manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a government to grant approvals or licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. Any of these actions could cause a loss of customer confidence in us and our products, which could adversely affect our sales. The requirements of regulatory authorities, including interpretative guidance, are subject to change and compliance with additional or changing requirements or interpretative guidance may subject us to further review, result in product launch delays or otherwise increase our costs. For information on current regulatory issues affecting us, please refer to the caption entitled “Certain Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In connection with these issues, there can be no assurance that additional costs or civil and criminal penalties will not be incurred, that additional regulatory actions with respect to us will not occur, that we will not face civil claims for damages from purchasers or users, that substantial additional charges or significant asset impairments may not be required, that sales of other products may not be adversely affected, or that additional regulation will not be introduced that may adversely affect our operations and consolidated financial statements.The sales, marketing and pricing of products and relationships that pharmaceutical and medical device companies have with healthcare providers are under increased scrutiny by federal, state and foreign government agencies. Compliance with the Anti-Kickback Statute, False Claims Act, Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (including as these laws relate to off-label promotion of products) and other healthcare related laws, as well as competition, data and patient privacy and export and import laws, is under increased focus by the agencies charged with overseeing such activities, including FDA, OIG, DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission. The DOJ and the Securities and Exchange Commission have also increased their focus on the enforcement of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), particularly as it relates to the conduct of pharmaceutical and medical product companies. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their employees, contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Healthcare professionals in many countries are employed by the government and consequently may be considered government officials. Foreign governments have also increased their scrutiny of pharmaceutical and medical product companies’ sales and marketing activities and relationships with healthcare providers and competitive practices generally. The laws and standards governing the promotion, pricing, sale and reimbursement of our products and those governing our relationships with healthcare providers and governments, including the Sunshine Act enacted under the Patient 11Protection and Affordable Care Act (as amended, the PPACA), can be complicated, are subject to frequent change and may be violated unknowingly.Additionally, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Control and the Bureau of Industry and Security at the U.S. Department of Commerce administer laws and regulations that restrict U.S. persons and, in some instances, non-U.S. persons, in conducting activities, transacting business or making investments in certain countries, or with governments, entities and individuals subject to U.S. economic sanctions. From time to time, certain of our subsidiaries have limited business dealings with countries subject to these sanctions, including Iran, Sudan, Syria, Russia and Cuba. These dealings represent an insignificant amount of our consolidated revenues and income but expose us to an increased risk of operating in these countries, including foreign exchange risks or restrictions or limitations on our ability to access funds generated in these jurisdictions, or the risk of violating applicable sanctions or regulations, which are complex and subject to frequent change. Additional restrictions may be enacted, enforced or interpreted in a way that may adversely affect our operations.We have compliance programs in place, including policies, training and various forms of monitoring, designed to address the risks discussed above. Nonetheless, these programs and policies may not always protect us from conduct by individual employees that violate these laws. Violations or allegations of violations of these laws may result in large civil and criminal penalties, debarment from participating in government programs, diversion of management time, attention and resources and may otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For more information related to our ongoing government investigations, please refer to Note 9 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.The laws and regulations discussed above are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial cost associated with compliance or to alter one or more of our sales and marketing practices and may subject us to enforcement actions or litigation which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.If reimbursement or other payment for our current or future products is reduced or modified in the United States or in foreign countries, including through the implementation or repeal of government-sponsored healthcare reform or other similar actions, cost containment measures, or changes to policies with respect to pricing, taxation or rebates, our business could suffer.Sales of our products depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our products are paid by both public and private payers. These payers include Medicare, Medicaid, and private healthcare insurers in the United States and foreign governments and third-party payers outside the United States. Our work with government payers carries various risks inherent in working with government entities and agencies, including government reporting and auditing, additional regulatory oversight, mandated contractual terms, failure of government appropriations or other complex procedural requirements.Public and private payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. We may continue to experience downward pricing pressures from any or all of these payers which could result in an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operational results. Global efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing. Governments around the world use various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures, such as price controls, the formation of public contracting authorities, product formularies, which are lists of recommended or approved products, and competitive tenders which require the submission of a bid to sell products. Sales of our products are dependent, in part, on the availability of reimbursement by government agencies and healthcare programs, as well as insurance companies and other private payers. In much of Europe, Latin America, Asia and Australia, for example, the government provides healthcare at low cost to patients, and controls its expenditures by purchasing products through public tenders, collective purchasing, regulating prices, setting reference prices in public tenders or limiting reimbursement or patient access to certain products. Additionally, austerity measures or other reforms by foreign governments may limit, reduce or eliminate payments for our products and adversely affect both pricing flexibility and demand for our products.The PPACA includes several provisions which impact our businesses in the United States, including increased Medicaid rebates and an expansion of the 340B Drug Pricing Program which provides certain qualified entities, such as hospitals serving disadvantaged populations, with discounts on the purchase of drugs for outpatient use and an excise tax on the sale of certain drugs. The PPACA reduces Medicare and Medicaid payments to hospitals and other providers, which may cause us to experience downward pricing pressure. Certain portions of the PPACA could negatively impact the demand for our products, and therefore our results of operations and financial position. 12The eventual impact of the current U.S. presidential administration on coverage, reimbursement and other matters related to the PPACA and/or healthcare reform in general, remains uncertain. Following an executive order from President Donald Trump, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced the launch of a new kidney health initiative. Proposed regulatory changes in kidney health policy and reimbursement may substantially change the U.S. end stage renal disease market and could impact demand for our peritoneal dialysis products, necessitating significant multi-year capital expenditures. Any such changes and the corresponding impact and related expenses are difficult to estimate in advance.In addition, a substantial portion of our revenues is dependent on federal healthcare program reimbursement, and any disruptions in federal government operations, including a federal government shutdown or failure of the U.S. government to enact annual appropriations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, disruptions in federal government operations may negatively impact regulatory approvals and guidance that are important to our operations, and create uncertainty about the pace of upcoming healthcare regulatory developments or approvals.As a result of these and other measures, including future measures or reforms that cannot be predicted, reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive basis. Legislation and regulations affecting reimbursement for our products may change at any time and in ways that may be adverse to us. We cannot predict the impact of these pressures and initiatives, or any negative effects of any additional regulations that may affect our business.There is substantial competition in the product markets in which we operate.Although no single company competes with us in all of our businesses, we face substantial competition in all of our markets from international and domestic healthcare and pharmaceutical companies and providers of all sizes, and these competitors often differ across our businesses. Competition is primarily focused on cost-effectiveness, price, service, product performance, and technological innovation.Competition may increase further as additional companies begin to enter our markets or modify their existing products to compete directly with ours. If our competitors respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or we do not introduce new versions or upgrades to our product portfolio in response to those requirements, our products may be rendered obsolete or non-competitive. If our competitors develop more effective or affordable products, or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than we do, our business, financial condition and operations will likely be negatively affected. If we are forced to reduce our prices due to increased competition, our business could become less profitable.  Our sales could be adversely affected if any of our contracts with GPOs, IDNs or other customers are terminated due to increased competition or otherwise.In addition, many health care industry companies, including health care systems, distributors, manufacturers, providers, and insurers, are consolidating or have formed strategic alliances. As the health care industry consolidates, competition to provide goods and services to industry participants will become more intense. Further, this consolidation creates larger enterprises with greater negotiating power, which they can use to negotiate price concessions. If we face an increase in costs or must reduce our prices because of industry consolidation, or if we lose customers as a result of consolidation, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.If our business development activities are unsuccessful, we may not realize the intended benefits.We expect to continue to engage in business development activities, including evaluating acquisitions, joint development opportunities, technology licensing arrangements and other opportunities. These activities may result in substantial investment of our resources. Our success developing products or expanding into new markets from such activities will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to find suitable opportunities for acquisition, investment or alliance; competition from other companies in the industries in which we operate that are seeking similar opportunities; whether we are able to complete an acquisition, investment or alliance on terms that are satisfactory to us; the strength of the other company’s underlying technology, products and ability to execute its business strategies; any intellectual property and litigation related to the other company’s products or technology; and our ability to successfully integrate the acquired company, business, product, technology or research into our existing operations, including the ability to adequately fund acquired in-process R&D projects and to maintain adequate controls over the combined operations. Certain of these activities are subject to antitrust and competition laws, which laws could impact our ability to pursue strategic transactions and could result in mandated divestitures 13in the context of proposed acquisitions. If we are unsuccessful in our business development activities, we may not realize the intended benefits of such activities, including that acquisition and integration costs may be greater than expected or the possibility that expected return on investment, synergies and accretion will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected timeframes.For more information on recent business development activities, see Note 4 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.If we are unable to protect our patents or other proprietary rights, or if we infringe the patents or other proprietary rights of others, our competitiveness and business prospects may be materially damaged.Patent and other proprietary rights are essential to our business. Our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain and enforce patents and licenses to patent rights, both in the United States and in other countries. We cannot guarantee that pending patent applications will result in issued patents, that patents issued or licensed will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, that our patents will not be found to be invalid or that the intellectual property rights of others will not prevent us from selling certain products or including key features in our products.The patent position of a healthcare company is often uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. Significant litigation concerning patents and products is pervasive in our industry. Patent claims include challenges to the coverage and validity of our patents on products or processes as well as allegations that our products infringe patents held by competitors or other third parties. An unfavorable litigation outcome in any of these types of cases could result in a loss of patent protection or the ability to market products, which could lead to a significant loss of sales, or otherwise materially affect future results of operations. We also rely on trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and know-how to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive positions. Third parties may know, discover or independently develop equivalent proprietary information or techniques, or they may gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our trade secrets to the public.Although our employees, consultants, parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners are generally subject to confidentiality or similar agreements to protect our confidential and proprietary information, these agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. To the extent that our employees, consultants, parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.Furthermore, our intellectual property, other proprietary technology and other sensitive company data is potentially vulnerable to loss, damage or misappropriation from system malfunction, computer viruses, unauthorized access to our data or misappropriation or misuse thereof by those with permitted access and other events. While we have invested to protect our intellectual property, confidential information and other data, and continue to work diligently in this area, there can be no assurance that our precautionary measures will prevent breakdowns, breaches, cyber incidents or other events. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.Misappropriation or other loss of our intellectual property from any of the foregoing would have an adverse effect on our competitive position and may cause us to incur substantial litigation costs.We are subject to risks associated with doing business globally.Our operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business globally and under the laws, regulations and customs of various jurisdictions and geographies. These risks include changes in exchange controls and other governmental actions, loss of business in government and public tenders that are held annually in many cases, increasingly complex labor environments, availability of raw materials, changes in taxation, tariffs, export control restrictions, changes in or violations of U.S. or local laws, including the FCPA, the United Kingdom Bribery Act, GDPR and other data privacy laws, dependence on a few government entities as customers, pricing restrictions, economic and political instability, monetary or currency volatility or instability (including as it relates to the U.S. dollar, the Euro, the Yuan and currencies in emerging market countries), disputes between countries, trade relationships and conflicts, diminished or insufficient protection of intellectual property, and disruption or destruction of operations in a significant geographic region regardless of cause, including natural disaster, pandemic, power loss, cyber-attack, data breach, war, terrorism, riot, labor disruption, civil insurrection or social unrest. Failure to comply with, or material changes to, the laws and regulations that affect our global operations could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.14The United Kingdom’s (UK) withdrawal from the European Union (EU) (commonly known as Brexit) effective January 31, 2020 and subsequent transition period through December 31, 2020 continues to create uncertainties affecting business operations in the EU.  The withdrawal by the UK from the EU, particularly if the transition period expires without a trade agreement between the UK and the EU, could result in the deterioration of economic conditions, volatility in currency exchange rates, and increased regulatory complexities, as well as the potential for product shortages, increased costs or other similar effects.  These outcomes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We are subject to risks associated with public health crises and epidemics/pandemics, such as the novel strain of coronavirus that recently originated in China.Our global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises and epidemics/pandemics, such as the novel strain of coronavirus that recently originated in China (COVID-19). COVID-19 may have an adverse impact on our operations, supply chains and distribution systems and increase our expenses, including as a result of impacts associated with preventive and precautionary measures that we, other businesses and governments are taking. Due to these impacts and measures, we may experience significant and unpredictable reductions or increases in demand for certain of our products as health care customers re-prioritize the treatment of patients. For example, elective surgeries are being de-prioritized which will negatively impact the usage of certain of our products, while other of our products are experiencing an increase in demand which we may not be able to meet in accordance with the customer’s desired timing. In addition to existing travel restrictions, countries may close borders, impose prolonged quarantines, and further restrict travel, which may significantly impact the ability of our employees to get to their places of work to produce products, or may significantly hamper our products from moving through the supply chain. As a result, while the financial impact on us has not been significant to date, given the rapid and evolving nature of the virus, COVID-19 could negatively affect our sales, and it is uncertain how COVID-19 will affect our global operations generally if these impacts persist or exacerbate over an extended period of time. Any of these impacts could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For further discussion, see the risk factor entitled “—If we are unable to obtain sufficient components or raw materials on a timely basis or for a cost-effective price or if we experience other manufacturing, sterilization or supply difficulties, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.”Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and liquidity.We generate the majority of our revenue and profit outside the United States. As a result, our financial results have been and may in the future be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or our ability to mitigate these risks. We may experience additional volatility as a result of inflationary pressures and other macroeconomic factors, including in emerging market countries. We are also exposed to changes in interest rates, and our ability to access the money markets and capital markets could be impeded if market conditions are not favorable.  A discussion of the financial impact of foreign exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations, and the ways and extent to which we attempt to mitigate such impact is contained under the caption “Financial Instrument Market Risk” in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities may have a negative impact on our operating results.Changes to the tax laws in the United States or other countries in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our operating results.  In particular, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and the regulations issued thereunder (collectively, 2017 Tax Act), including, among other things, certain changes in tax rates, deductibility of interest, deductibility of executive compensation expense, expensing of capital expenditures, the ability to use certain tax credits, taxation on earnings from international business operations, and the treatment of deductible payments made by our U.S. affiliates to our foreign affiliates could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  In certain instances, the 2017 Tax Act could have a negative effect on our tax rate and the carrying value of tax balances.  Any of these changes could adversely affect our financial performance.  There remains some uncertainty regarding the implementation of the 2017 Tax Act and its impact on us.  We cannot currently predict the full impact that the 2017 Tax Act may have over time on our business, including revenues, profit margins, profitability, operating cash flows and results of operations. For more information regarding the impact of the 2017 Tax Act, see Note 14 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Similarly, the outcome of various initiatives currently being undertaken by the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development could significantly impact how we allocate profits across multiple jurisdictions, which could adversely impact our global tax obligations. 15Taxing authorities may audit us from time to time and disagree with certain positions we have taken in respect of our tax liabilities.  Our tax liabilities are affected by many factors, including the amounts we charge in intra-company transactions for inventory, services, licenses, funding and other items, which are subject to the use of assumptions and judgment. Because we operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States, cross border transactions among our affiliates are a significant part of the manner in which we operate. Although we believe that we transact intra-company business in accordance with arm's-length principles, tax authorities may disagree with our intra-company charges, cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters, and may assess additional taxes as a result, including in connection with their review of the restated financial statements we have filed as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. However, we may not accurately predict the outcome of these audits and, as a result, the actual outcome of these audits may have an adverse impact on our financial results. For more information on ongoing audits, see Note 14 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.If we fail to attract and retain key employees our business may suffer.Our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees, including people in senior management, sales, marketing, information technology and R&D positions. Competition for top talent in the healthcare industry can be intense. Our ability to recruit and retain such talent will depend on a number of factors, including hiring practices of our competitors, compensation and benefits, work location, work environment and industry economic conditions. If we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified employees, our business could suffer.We are party to a number of pending lawsuits and other disputes which may have an adverse impact on our business, operations or financial condition.We are party to a number of pending lawsuits, settlement discussions, mediations, arbitrations and other disputes. In addition, in the future we may be party to such disputes, including patent, product liability or other lawsuits. These current and future matters may result in a loss of patent protection, reduced revenue, incurrence of significant liabilities and diversion of our management’s time, attention and resources. Given the uncertain nature of litigation and other disputes generally, we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in these current matters. In view of these uncertainties, the outcome of these matters may result in charges in excess of any established reserves, and, to the extent available, liability insurance. We also continue to be self-insured with respect to product liability claims. The absence of third-party insurance coverage for current or future claims increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims and adverse decisions. Protracted litigation and other disputes, including any adverse outcomes, may have an adverse impact on our business, operations or financial condition. Even claims without merit could subject us to adverse publicity and require us to incur significant legal fees. See Note 9 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding current lawsuits.Our operating results and financial condition may fluctuate.Our operating results and financial condition may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year for a number of reasons. Events, such as a delay in product development, changes to our expectations or strategy or even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause financial results for a period to be below our expectations or projections. As a result, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful, and these comparisons should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our operating results and financial condition are also subject to fluctuation from all of the risks described throughout this section. These fluctuations may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and our stock price.We may not achieve our financial goals.Since the spin-off of Baxalta, we have been executing on plans to enhance profitability and returns for our stockholders. We continue to evaluate and refine both our short-term and long-term financial objectives.  Our strategy to achieve these objectives is focused on strengthening our portfolio and extending our impact through transformative innovation that spans prevention to recovery. As part of this strategy, we will be investing in portfolio innovation and market development and entering adjacencies while continuing to drive operational excellence through ongoing business transformation efforts and organization optimization. We will also look to unlock additional 16value through strategic capital deployment. We may fail to achieve our targeted financial results if we are unsuccessful in implementing our strategies, our estimates or assumptions change or for any other reason. Our failure to achieve our financial goals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Future material impairments in the value of our long-lived assets, including goodwill, could negatively affect our operating results.We regularly review our long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets, goodwill (which results from our acquisition activity) and property, plant and equipment, for impairment. Goodwill and acquired indefinite life intangible assets are subject to impairment review on an annual basis and whenever potential impairment indicators are present. Other long-lived assets are reviewed when there is an indication that impairment may have occurred. Changes in market conditions or other changes in the future outlook of value may lead to impairment charges in the future. In addition, we may from time to time sell assets that we determine are not critical to our strategy, including in connection with certain strategic exits. Future events or decisions may lead to asset impairments and/or related charges. Certain non-cash impairments may result from a change in our strategic goals, business direction or other factors relating to the overall business environment. Material impairment charges could negatively affect our results of operations.  For more information on the valuation and impairment of long-lived assets, refer to the discussion under the caption entitled “Critical Accounting Policies” in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect our business and financial condition.Our ability to generate cash flows from operations could be affected if there is a material decline in the demand for our products, in the solvency of our customers or suppliers, or deterioration in our key financial ratios or credit ratings. Current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of our customers (including governments) to pay for our products and services, and the amount spent on healthcare generally. This could result in a decrease in the demand for our products and services, declining cash flows, longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. These conditions may also adversely affect certain of our suppliers, which could cause a disruption in our ability to produce our products. We continue to do business with foreign governments in certain countries, including Greece, Spain, Portugal, and Italy, which have experienced deterioration in credit and economic conditions. While global economic conditions have not significantly impacted our ability to collect receivables, liquidity issues in certain countries have resulted, and may continue to result, in delays in the collection of receivables and credit losses. These conditions may also impact the stability of the U.S. dollar, Euro or Yuan. We may incur operational difficulties or be exposed to claims and liabilities as a result of the separation and distribution of Baxalta.On July 1, 2015, we distributed approximately 80.5% of the outstanding shares of Baxalta common stock to Baxter stockholders in connection with the separation of our biopharmaceuticals business. We disposed of our remaining 19.5% stake in Baxalta (Retained Shares) in 2016, in connection with a series of transactions, including debt-for-equity exchanges, an equity-for-equity exchange and a contribution to our U.S. pension plan (Retained Shares Transactions). Shire plc (Shire) acquired Baxalta in June 2016, after completion of the last Retained Shares Transaction, and in January 2019, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (Takeda) acquired Shire.  In connection with the July 2015 distribution, we entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements (including a tax matters agreement, a long-term services agreement, a manufacturing and supply agreement, a trademark license agreement, a Galaxy license agreement, an international commercial operations agreement and certain other commercial agreements) with Baxalta. These agreements govern the separation and distribution and the relationship between the companies going forward, including with respect to potential tax-related losses associated with the separation and distribution and the Retained Shares Transactions. They also provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time (including under the manufacturing and supply agreement pursuant to which Shire now manufactures and sells certain products and materials to us).The separation and distribution agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make Baxalta financially responsible for many liabilities that may exist relating to its business activities, whether incurred prior to or after the distribution, including any pending or future litigation. In addition, the separation and distribution agreement provides for certain indemnification obligations of Baxter, which may be significant.  It is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between us and Baxalta and require us to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to Baxalta. Third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of these liabilities or obligations, and we may be unsuccessful in obtaining indemnification or the indemnity rights we have under the separation and 17distribution agreement may not be sufficient to fully cover all of these liabilities and obligations. Even if we are successful in obtaining indemnification, we may have to bear costs.  These risks could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.The separation and distribution of Baxalta continues to involve a number of risks, including, among other things, the indemnification risks described above. Certain of the agreements described above provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time. Takeda may elect to extend the term for which we provide services to Baxalta under these agreements. If Baxalta is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements, including its indemnification obligations, we could incur losses. These arrangements could also lead to disputes over rights to certain shared property and over the allocation of costs and revenues for products and operations.There could be significant liability if the separation and distribution or any Retained Shares Transaction is determined to be a taxable transaction. Baxalta has indemnified us for certain potential liabilities that may arise, and such indemnification obligation is guaranteed by Shire, but Baxalta and Shire may be unable to satisfy their indemnification obligations to us in the future.The separation and distribution and the Retained Shares Transactions (collectively, the Baxter Transactions) qualify for tax-free treatment to Baxter and its stockholders under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). Completion of the separation and distribution was conditioned upon, among other things, the receipt of a private letter ruling from the IRS regarding certain issues relating to the tax-free treatment of the Baxter Transactions. Although the IRS private letter ruling is generally binding on the IRS, the continuing validity of such ruling is subject to the accuracy of factual representations and assumptions made in the ruling. Completion of the distribution was also conditioned upon Baxter’s receipt of a tax opinion from KPMG LLP regarding certain aspects of the Baxalta separation not covered by the IRS private letter ruling. The opinion was based upon various factual representations and assumptions, as well as certain undertakings made by Baxter and Baxalta. If any of the factual representations or assumptions in the IRS private letter ruling or tax opinion is untrue or incomplete in any material respect, if any undertaking is not complied with, or if the facts upon which the IRS private letter ruling or tax opinion are based are materially different from the actual facts relating to the Baxter Transactions, the opinion or IRS private letter ruling may not be valid. Moreover, opinions of a tax advisor are not binding on the IRS. As a result, the conclusions expressed in the opinion of a tax advisor could be successfully challenged by the IRS.If the Baxter Transactions are determined to be taxable, Baxter and its stockholders could incur significant tax liabilities. Pursuant to the tax matters agreement, Baxalta agreed to indemnify us for certain tax-related losses incurred if Baxalta’s actions cause the separation and distribution and certain related transactions to fail to qualify for tax-free status under the applicable provisions of the Code.In anticipation of the merger between Baxalta and Shire (the Merger), we entered into a letter agreement with Shire and Baxalta (the Letter Agreement). Under the Letter Agreement, Baxalta agreed to indemnify, and Shire agreed to guarantee such indemnity to, Baxter and each of its affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors and employees against certain tax-related losses attributable to or resulting from (in whole or in part) the Merger as further described in the Letter Agreement. If the Baxter Transactions are determined to be taxable as a result (in whole or in part) of the Merger (for example, if the Merger is deemed to be part of a plan (or series of related transactions) that includes the Baxter Transactions), Baxter and its stockholders could incur significant tax liabilities. Although Baxalta and Shire may be required to indemnify Baxter under the tax matters agreement and the Letter Agreement for any such tax liabilities incurred by Baxter, there can be no assurance that the indemnity from Baxalta or the guarantee thereof by Shire will be sufficient to protect us against all or a part of the amount of such liabilities, or that either Baxalta or Shire will fully satisfy their respective obligations.Even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Baxalta or Shire any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be required to bear these costs initially, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition"
7,BAX,BAXTER INTERNATIONAL INC,2019-02-21,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
.In addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, stockholders or prospective investors should carefully consider the following risk factors. If any of the events described below occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, future growth prospects and stock price could suffer.We may not achieve our long-term financial improvement goals.We have been implementing plans to enhance profitability and returns for our stockholders. These plans include the achievement of certain financial goals in 2019 and beyond. While we are continuing to refine these goals, our plan contemplates significant margin expansion over our long-range plan, which runs through 2023. We have identified certain key strategies to help achieve these targets. These strategies include optimizing our core product portfolio globally, driving operational excellence through the realignment of our cost structure and various restructuring activities and maximizing the value derived from the allocation of our capital.As part of these strategies, we continue to evaluate the performance of all of our businesses and may sell or acquire a business or product line or exit a particular market. We are also evaluating our corporate and commercial infrastructure in the interest of streamlining costs while maintaining our commitment to quality and safety. Future divestitures may result in significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets. Future acquisitions may fail to achieve the desired financial results (including return on investment) and synergies and may not provide the desired market access. The restructuring of our operations may not generate targeted savings or may cause unexpected disruptions to our business. As a result, we may not achieve our targeted financial results, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.If we are unable to successfully introduce new products or fail to keep pace with advances in technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.We need to successfully introduce new products to achieve our strategic business objectives. Product development requires substantial investment and there is inherent risk in the R&D process. A successful product development process depends on many factors, including our ability to properly anticipate and satisfy customer needs, adapt to new technologies, obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis, demonstrate satisfactory clinical results, manufacture products in an economical and timely manner and differentiate our products from those of our competitors. If we cannot successfully introduce new products or adapt to changing technologies, our products may become obsolete and our revenue and profitability could suffer.Issues with product supply or quality could have an adverse effect on our business, subject us to regulatory actions, or cause a loss of customer confidence in us or our products, among other negative consequences.Our success depends upon the availability and quality of our products. The pharmaceutical and medical products industries are competitive and subject to complex market dynamics and varying demand levels. These levels vary in response to macro-economic conditions, regulatory requirements (including the availability of private or public reimbursement), seasonality, natural disasters, epidemics and other matters. Additionally, the development of new or enhanced products involves a lengthy regulatory process and is capital intensive. As a result, our ability to match our production levels and capacity to market demand is imprecise and may result in a failure to meet market demand or satisfy customer requirements for our products or, alternatively, an oversupply of inventory. Failure to meet market demand may result in customers transitioning to available competitive products, loss of market share, negative publicity, reputational damage, loss of customer confidence or other negative consequences (including a decline in stock price). In the event of an oversupply, we may be forced to lower our prices, record asset impairment charges or take other actions, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Additionally, quality management plays an essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements, preventing defects, improving our products and services and assuring the safety and efficacy of our products. Our future success depends on our ability to maintain and continuously improve our quality management program. While we have a quality system that covers the lifecycle of our 5 products, quality and safety issues may occur with respect to any of our products. A quality or safety issue may result in adverse inspection reports, voluntary or official action indicated, warning letters, import bans, product recalls (either voluntary or required by FDA or similar governmental authorities in other countries) or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, costly litigation, refusal of a government to grant approvals and licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. An inability to address a quality or safety issue in an effective and timely manner may also cause negative publicity, a loss of customer confidence in us or our current or future products, which may result in the loss of sales and difficulty in successfully launching new products. Additionally, Baxter has made and continues to make significant investments in assets, including inventory and property, plant and equipment, which relate to potential new products or modifications to existing products. Product quality or safety issues may restrict us from being able to realize the expected returns from these investments, potentially resulting in asset impairments in the future.Unaffiliated third party suppliers provide a number of goods and services to our R&D, clinical and manufacturing organizations. Third party suppliers are required to comply with our quality standards. Failure of a third party supplier to provide compliant raw materials or supplies could result in delays, service interruptions or other quality related issues that may negatively impact our business results. For more information on regulatory matters currently affecting us, refer to the discussion under the caption entitled “Certain Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.If we are unable to obtain sufficient components or raw materials on a timely basis or for a cost-effective price or if we experience other manufacturing or supply difficulties, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.The manufacture of our products requires, among other things, the timely supply or delivery of sufficient amounts of quality components and materials. We manufacture our products in approximately 50 manufacturing facilities around the world. We acquire our components, materials and other requirements for manufacturing from many suppliers and vendors in various countries, including sometimes from ourselves for self-supplied requirements. We endeavor, either alone or working closely with our suppliers, to ensure the continuity of our inputs and supplies but we cannot guarantee these efforts will always be successful. Further, while efforts are made to diversify certain of our sources of components and materials, in certain instances there is only a sole source or supplier with no alternatives yet identified. For most of our components and materials for which a single source or supplier is used, alternative sources or suppliers may exist, but we have made a strategic determination to use the single source or supplier. Although we do carry strategic inventory and maintain insurance to help mitigate the potential risk related to any related supply disruption, there can be no assurance that such measures will be sufficient or effective. A reduction or interruption in supply and an inability to quickly develop acceptable alternative sources for such supply, could adversely affect our ability to manufacture and distribute our products in a timely or cost-effective manner, and our ability to make product sales.  Additionally, volatility in our costs of energy, transportation/freight, components, raw materials and other supply, manufacturing and distribution costs could adversely affect our results of operations. Climate change (including laws or regulations passed in response thereto) could increase our costs, in particular our costs of supply, energy and transportation/freight. Material or sustained increases in the price of oil could have an adverse impact on the cost of many of the plastic materials we use to make and package our products, as well as our transportation/freight costs. These outcomes may in turn result in customers transitioning to available competitive products, loss of market share, negative publicity, reputational damage, loss of customer confidence or other negative consequences (including a decline in stock price).Many of our products are difficult to manufacture. This is due to the complex nature of manufacturing pharmaceuticals, including biologics, and devices, as well as the strict regulatory regime governing our manufacturing operations. Variations in the manufacturing process may result in production failures which could lead to launch delays, product shortage, unanticipated costs, lost revenues and damage to our reputation. A failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers may also result in a quality or safety issue of the type discussed above.Some of our products are manufactured at a single manufacturing facility or stored at a single storage site. Loss or damage to a manufacturing facility or storage site due to a natural disaster, such as we experienced as a result of Hurricane Maria, or otherwise could adversely affect our ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of key products or otherwise deliver products to meet customer demand or contractual requirements which may result in a loss of revenue and other adverse business consequences (including those identified in the paragraph above). Because of the time required to approve and license a manufacturing facility, a third party manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis (if at all) to replace production capacity in the event we lose manufacturing capacity or products are otherwise unavailable due to natural disaster, regulatory action or otherwise.6 We are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and subject to privacy and security laws, and our systems and infrastructure face certain risks, including from cyber security breaches and data leakage.We increasingly rely upon technology systems and infrastructure, including support provided by our partners and third parties, to support our business, our products and our customers.  For example, we routinely rely on our technology systems and infrastructure to aid us in the collection, use, storage and transfer, disclosure and other processing of voluminous amounts of data including confidential, business, financial, personal and other sensitive information (collectively, Confidential Information). We also rely on systems for manufacturing, customer orders, shipping, regulatory compliance and various other matters. Certain of our products and systems collect data regarding patients and their therapy and some connect to our systems for maintenance and other purposes.Additionally, the legal and regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the imposition of new and changing requirements across businesses. We are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing legal and regulatory requirements that govern the collection, use, storage, security, transfer, disclosure and other processing of personal data, including, but not limited to, The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 and the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).  In May 2018, the GDPR superseded current European Union data protection legislation, imposed more stringent European Union data protection requirements, and provided for greater penalties for noncompliance.  We or our third-party providers and business partners may also be subjected to audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to compliance with information security and privacy laws and regulations, and noncompliance with the laws and regulations could result in substantial and material fines or class action litigation.  The increasing use and evolution of technology, including cloud-based computing, and reliance on third parties creates additional opportunities for the unintentional, intentional and/or unauthorized exposure, dissemination and/or destruction of Confidential Information stored in our devices, systems, servers, infrastructure and products (collectively, Technology).  Security threats, including cyber and other attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, frequent, and adaptive. Our Technology (and that of third parties that we use) is vulnerable to breakdown, interruption, cyber and other security attacks, system malfunction, unauthorized access, inadvertent exposure or disclosure of information, theft and other events.  Any such vulnerability could compromise our Technology and could expose Confidential Information to unauthorized third parties and/or cause permanent loss of such data.  In addition to loss of Confidential Information, unauthorized access to or interference with our Technology may cause product functionality issues that may result in risk to patient safety, field actions and/or product recalls. While we have invested in the protection of data and Technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns, attacks, breaches in our Technology, cyber incidents or other incidents or ensure compliance with all applicable security and privacy laws, regulations and standards, including with respect to third party service providers that host or process Confidential Information on our behalf.  Such incidents can lead to substantial and material regulatory fines and penalties, business disruption, reputational harm, financial loss as well as other damages.  Misappropriation or other loss of our intellectual property from any of the foregoing may have an adverse effect on our competitive position and may cause us to incur substantial litigation costs.  We could also suffer strained relationships with customers and business partners, increased costs (for security measures, remediation or otherwise), litigation (including class actions and stockholder derivative actions) or other negative consequences (including a decline in stock price) from breaches, cyber and other security attacks, industrial espionage, ransomware, email or phishing scams, malware or other cyber incidents, which may compromise our system infrastructure or lead to data leakage, either internally or at our third-party providers or other business partners.  In addition, significant implementation issues may arise as we continue to consolidate and outsource certain computer operations and application support activities. We also face all of the same risks listed above and other heightened risks when acquiring a company, in particular if we need to transition or implement certain processes or controls with the acquired company.We are subject to a number of existing laws and regulations, non-compliance with which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and we are susceptible to a changing regulatory environment.As a participant in the healthcare industry, our operations and products, and those of our customers, are regulated by numerous government agencies, both inside and outside the United States. The impact of this on us is direct to the extent we are subject to these laws and regulations, and indirect in that in a number of situations, even though we may not be directly regulated by specific healthcare laws and regulations, our products must be capable of being used by our customers in a manner that complies with those laws and regulations.The manufacture, distribution, marketing and use of our products are subject to extensive regulation and scrutiny by FDA and other regulatory authorities globally. Any new product must undergo lengthy and rigorous testing and other extensive, costly and time-consuming procedures mandated by FDA and foreign regulatory authorities. The same testing and procedures sometimes apply to 7 current products that are up for authorization renewal or are subject to changes in law or regulation (for example certain of our medical devices will have to comply with the new European Union Medical Device Regulation). Changes to current products may be subject to vigorous review, including additional 510(k) and other regulatory submissions, and approvals or the time needed to secure approvals are not certain. Our facilities must be approved and licensed prior to production and remain subject to inspection from time to time thereafter. Failure to comply with the requirements of FDA or other regulatory authorities, including a failed inspection or a failure in our adverse event reporting system, could result in adverse inspection reports, voluntary or official action indicated, warning letters, import bans, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, reputational damage, injunctions to halt the manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a government to grant approvals or licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. Any of these actions could cause a loss of customer confidence in us and our products, which could adversely affect our sales. The requirements of regulatory authorities, including interpretative guidance, are subject to change and compliance with additional or changing requirements or interpretative guidance may subject us to further review, result in product launch delays or otherwise increase our costs. For information on current regulatory issues affecting us, please refer to the caption entitled “Certain Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In connection with these issues, there can be no assurance that additional costs or civil and criminal penalties will not be incurred, that additional regulatory actions with respect to us will not occur, that we will not face civil claims for damages from purchasers or users, that substantial additional charges or significant asset impairments may not be required, that sales of other products may not be adversely affected, or that additional regulation will not be introduced that may adversely affect our operations and consolidated financial statements.The sales, marketing and pricing of products and relationships that pharmaceutical and medical device companies have with healthcare providers are under increased scrutiny by federal, state and foreign government agencies. Compliance with the Anti-Kickback Statute, False Claims Act, Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (including as these laws relate to off-label promotion of products) and other healthcare related laws, as well as competition, data and patient privacy and export and import laws, is under increased focus by the agencies charged with overseeing such activities, including FDA, OIG, DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission. The DOJ and the Securities and Exchange Commission have also increased their focus on the enforcement of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), particularly as it relates to the conduct of pharmaceutical and medical product companies. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their employees, contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Healthcare professionals in many countries are employed by the government and consequently may be considered government officials. Foreign governments have also increased their scrutiny of pharmaceutical and medical product companies’ sales and marketing activities and relationships with healthcare providers and competitive practices generally. The laws and standards governing the promotion, pricing, sale and reimbursement of our products and those governing our relationships with healthcare providers and governments, including the Sunshine Act enacted under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (as amended, the PPACA), can be complicated, are subject to frequent change and may be violated unknowingly. Additionally, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Control and the Bureau of Industry and Security at the U.S. Department of Commerce administer laws and regulations that restrict U.S. persons and, in some instances, non-U.S. persons, in conducting activities, transacting business or making investments in certain countries, or with governments, entities and individuals subject to U.S. economic sanctions. From time to time, certain of our subsidiaries have limited business dealings in countries subject to these sanctions, including Iran, Sudan, Syria, Russia and Cuba. These dealings represent an insignificant amount of our consolidated revenues and income but expose us to an increased risk of operating in these countries, including foreign exchange risks or restrictions or limitations on our ability to access funds generated in these jurisdictions, or the risk of violating applicable sanctions regulations, which are complex and subject to frequent change. Additional restrictions may be enacted, enforced or interpreted in a way that may adversely affect our operations.We have compliance programs in place, including policies, training and various forms of monitoring, designed to address the risks discussed above. Nonetheless, these programs and policies may not always protect us from conduct by individual employees that violate these laws. Violations or allegations of violations of these laws may result in large civil and criminal penalties, debarment from participating in government programs, diversion of management time, attention and resources and may otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For more information related to our ongoing government investigations, please refer to Note 17 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.The laws and regulations discussed above are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial cost associated with compliance or to alter one or more of our sales and marketing practices and may subject us to enforcement actions or litigation which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.8 If reimbursement or other payment for our current or future products is reduced or modified in the United States or in foreign countries, including through the implementation or repeal of government-sponsored healthcare reform or other similar actions, cost containment measures, or changes to policies with respect to pricing, taxation or rebates, our business could suffer.Sales of our products depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our products are paid by both public and private payers. These payers include Medicare, Medicaid, and private healthcare insurers in the United States and foreign governments and third-party payers outside the United States. Our work with government payers carries various risks inherent in working with government entities and agencies, including government reporting and auditing, additional regulatory oversight, mandated contractual terms, failure of government appropriations or other complex procedural requirements. Public and private payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. We may continue to experience downward pricing pressures from any or all of these payers which could result in an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operational results.Global efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing. Governments around the world use various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures such as price controls, the formation of public contracting authorities, product formularies, which are lists of recommended or approved products, and competitive tenders which require the submission of a bid to sell products. Sales of our products are dependent, in part, on the availability of reimbursement by government agencies and healthcare programs, as well as insurance companies and other private payers. In much of Europe, Latin America, Asia and Australia, for example, the government provides healthcare at low cost to patients, and controls its expenditures by purchasing products through public tenders, collective purchasing, regulating prices, setting reference prices in public tenders or limiting reimbursement or patient access to certain products. Additionally, austerity measures or other reforms by foreign governments may limit, reduce or eliminate payments for our products and adversely affect both pricing flexibility and demand for our products.The PPACA includes several provisions which impact our businesses in the United States, including increased Medicaid rebates and an expansion of the 340B Drug Pricing Program which provides certain qualified entities, such as hospitals serving disadvantaged populations, with discounts on the purchase of drugs for outpatient use and an excise tax on the sale of certain drugs. The PPACA reduces Medicare and Medicaid payments to hospitals and other providers, which may cause us to experience downward pricing pressure. Certain portions of the PPACA, could negatively impact the demand for our products, and therefore our results of operations and financial position. It is uncertain what impact the current U.S. presidential administration might have on coverage, reimbursement and other matters related to the PPACA and/or healthcare reform in general, including the timing and speed of any such impact.  In addition, a substantial portion of our revenues is dependent on federal healthcare program reimbursement, and any disruptions in federal government operations, including a federal government shutdown or failure of the U.S. government to enact annual appropriations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, disruptions in federal government operations may negatively impact regulatory approvals and guidance that are important to our operations, and create uncertainty about the pace of upcoming healthcare regulatory developments or approvals.As a result of these and other measures, including future measures or reforms that cannot be predicted, reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive basis. Legislation and regulations affecting reimbursement for our products may change at any time and in ways that may be adverse to us. We cannot predict the impact of these pressures and initiatives, or any negative effects of any additional regulations that may affect our business.There is substantial competition in the product markets in which we operate.Although no single company competes with us in all of our businesses, we face substantial competition in all of our markets from international and domestic healthcare and pharmaceutical companies and providers of all sizes, and these competitors often differ across our businesses. Competition is primarily focused on cost-effectiveness, price, service, product performance, and technological innovation.Competition may increase further as additional companies begin to enter our markets or modify their existing products to compete directly with ours. If our competitors respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or we do not introduce new versions or upgrades to our product portfolio in response to those requirements, our products may be rendered obsolete or non-competitive. If our competitors develop more effective or affordable products, or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than we do, our business, financial condition and operations will likely be negatively affected. If we are forced to reduce our prices due to increased competition, our business could become less profitable.  Our sales 9 could be adversely affected if any of our contracts with GPOs, IDNs or other customers are terminated due to increased competition or otherwise.In addition, many health care industry companies, including health care systems, distributors, manufacturers, providers, and insurers, are consolidating or have formed strategic alliances. As the health care industry consolidates, competition to provide goods and services to industry participants will become more intense. Further, this consolidation creates larger enterprises with greater negotiating power, which they can use to negotiate price concessions. If we face an increase in costs or must reduce our prices because of industry consolidation, or if we lose customers as a result of consolidation, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.If our business development activities are unsuccessful, we may not realize the intended benefits.We expect to continue to engage in business development activities including evaluating acquisitions, joint development opportunities, technology licensing arrangements and other opportunities. These activities may result in substantial investment of our resources. Our success developing products or expanding into new markets from such activities will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to find suitable opportunities for acquisition, investment or alliance; competition from other companies in the industries in which we operate that are seeking similar opportunities; whether we are able to complete an acquisition, investment or alliance on terms that are satisfactory to us; the strength of the other company’s underlying technology, products and ability to execute its business strategies; any intellectual property and litigation related to the other company’s products or technology; and our ability to successfully integrate the acquired company, business, product, technology or research into our existing operations, including the ability to adequately fund acquired in-process R&D projects and to maintain adequate controls over the combined operations. Certain of these activities are subject to antitrust and competition laws, which laws could impact our ability to pursue strategic transactions and could result in mandated divestitures in the context of proposed acquisitions. If we are unsuccessful in our business development activities, we may not realize the intended benefits of such activities, including that acquisition and integration costs may be greater than expected or the possibility that expected return on investment, synergies and accretion will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected timeframes. For more information on recent business development activities, see Note 5 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.If we are unable to protect our patents or other proprietary rights, or if we infringe the patents or other proprietary rights of others, our competitiveness and business prospects may be materially damaged.Patent and other proprietary rights are essential to our business. Our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain and enforce patents and licenses to patent rights, both in the United States and in other countries. We cannot guarantee that pending patent applications will result in issued patents, that patents issued or licensed will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, that our patents will not be found to be invalid or that the intellectual property rights of others will not prevent us from selling certain products or including key features in our products.The patent position of a healthcare company is often uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. Significant litigation concerning patents and products is pervasive in our industry. Patent claims include challenges to the coverage and validity of our patents on products or processes as well as allegations that our products infringe patents held by competitors or other third parties. An unfavorable litigation outcome in any of these types of cases could result in a loss of patent protection or the ability to market products, which could lead to a significant loss of sales, or otherwise materially affect future results of operations. We also rely on trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and know-how to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive positions. Third parties may know, discover or independently develop equivalent proprietary information or techniques, or they may gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our trade secrets to the public.Although our employees, consultants, parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners are generally subject to confidentiality or similar agreements to protect our confidential and proprietary information, these agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. To the extent that our employees, consultants, parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.Furthermore, our intellectual property, other proprietary technology and other sensitive company data is potentially vulnerable to loss, damage or misappropriation from system malfunction, computer viruses, unauthorized access to our data or misappropriation or misuse thereof by those with permitted access and other events. While we have invested to protect our intellectual property, confidential information and other data, and continue to work diligently in this area, there can be no assurance that our precautionary measures will prevent breakdowns, breaches, cyber incidents or other events. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.10 Misappropriation or other loss of our intellectual property from any of the foregoing would have an adverse effect on our competitive position and may cause us to incur substantial litigation costs.We are subject to risks associated with doing business globally.Our operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business globally and under the laws, regulations and customs of various jurisdictions and geographies. These risks include changes in exchange controls and other governmental actions, loss of business in government and public tenders that are held annually in many cases, increasingly complex labor environments, availability of raw materials, changes in taxation, export control restrictions, changes in or violations of U.S. or local laws, including the FCPA, the United Kingdom Bribery Act, GDPR and other data privacy laws, dependence on a few government entities as customers, pricing restrictions, economic and political instability, monetary or currency volatility or instability (including as it relates to the U.S. dollar, the Euro, the Yuan and currencies in emerging market countries), disputes between countries, diminished or insufficient protection of intellectual property, and disruption or destruction of operations in a significant geographic region regardless of cause, including natural disaster, pandemic, power loss, cyber attack, data breach, war, terrorism, riot, labor disruption, civil insurrection or social unrest. Failure to comply with, or material changes to, the laws and regulations that affect our global operations could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. The 2016 referendum by British voters to exit the European Union (EU) (commonly known as Brexit) and the UK government’s subsequent initiation of the withdrawal process has created uncertainties affecting business operations in the EU.  The potential withdrawal by the UK from the EU, particularly if such withdrawal occurs without a transitional agreement between the UK and the EU, could result in the deterioration of economic conditions, volatility in currency exchange rates, and increased regulatory complexities, as well as the potential for product shortages, increased costs or other similar effects.  These outcomes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and liquidity.We generate the majority of our revenue and profit outside the United States. As a result, our financial results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or our ability to mitigate these risks. We may experience additional volatility as a result of inflationary pressures and other macroeconomic factors, including in emerging market countries. We are also exposed to changes in interest rates, and our ability to access the money markets and capital markets could be impeded if market conditions are not favorable.  A discussion of the financial impact of foreign exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations, and the ways and extent to which we attempt to mitigate such impact is contained under the caption “Financial Instrument Market Risk” in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities may have a negative impact on our operating results.Changes to the tax laws in the United States or other countries in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our operating results.  In particular, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and the regulations issued thereunder (collectively, Tax Reform), including, among other things, certain changes in tax rates, deductibility of interest, deductibility of executive compensation expense, expensing of capital expenditures, the ability to use certain tax credits, taxation on earnings from international business operations, and the treatment of deductible payments made by our U.S. affiliates to our foreign affiliates could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  In certain instances, Tax Reform could have a negative effect on our tax rate and the carrying value of deferred tax balances.  Any of these changes could adversely affect our financial performance.  There remains some uncertainty regarding the implementation of such Tax Reform and its impact on us.  We cannot currently predict the full impact that Tax Reform may have over time on our business, including revenues, profit margins, profitability, operating cash flows and results of operations. For more information regarding the impact of Tax Reform, see Note 16 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Taxing authorities may audit us from time to time and disagree with certain positions we have taken in respect of our tax liabilities.  Our tax liabilities are affected by many factors, including the amounts we charge in intercompany transactions for inventory, services, licenses, funding and other items, which are subject to the use of assumptions and judgment. Because we operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States, cross border transactions among our affiliates are a significant part of the manner in which we operate. Although we believe that we transact intercompany business in accordance with arms-length principles, tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges, cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters, and may assess additional taxes as a result.We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. However, we may not accurately predict the outcome of these audits, and as a result the actual outcome of these audits may have an adverse impact on our financial results. For more information on ongoing audits, see Note 16 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.11 If we fail to attract and retain key employees our business may suffer.Our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees, including people in senior management, sales, marketing and R&D positions. Competition for top talent in the healthcare industry can be intense. Our ability to recruit and retain such talent will depend on a number of factors, including hiring practices of our competitors, compensation and benefits, work location, work environment and industry economic conditions. If we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified employees, our business could suffer.We are party to a number of pending lawsuits and other disputes which may have an adverse impact on our business, operations or financial condition.We are party to a number of pending lawsuits, settlement discussions, mediations, arbitrations and other disputes. In addition, in the future we may be party to such disputes, including patent, product liability or other lawsuits. These current and future matters may result in a loss of patent protection, reduced revenue, incurrence of significant liabilities and diversion of our management’s time, attention and resources. Given the uncertain nature of litigation and other disputes generally, we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in these current matters. In view of these uncertainties, the outcome of these matters may result in charges in excess of any established reserves, and, to the extent available, liability insurance. We also continue to be self-insured with respect to product liability claims. The absence of third-party insurance coverage for current or future claims increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims and adverse decisions. Protracted litigation and other disputes, including any adverse outcomes, may have an adverse impact on our business, operations or financial condition. Even claims without merit could subject us to adverse publicity and require us to incur significant legal fees. See Note 17 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding current lawsuits.Our operating results and financial condition may fluctuate. Our operating results and financial condition may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year for a number of reasons. Events such as a delay in product development, changes to our expectations or strategy or even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause financial results for a period to be below our expectations or projections. As a result, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful, and these comparisons should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our operating results and financial condition are also subject to fluctuation from all of the risks described throughout this section. These fluctuations may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and our stock price. Future material impairments in the value of our long-lived assets, including goodwill, could negatively affect our operating results. We regularly review our long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets, goodwill (which results from our acquisition activity) and property, plant and equipment, for impairment. Goodwill and acquired indefinite life intangible assets are subject to impairment review on an annual basis and whenever potential impairment indicators are present. Other long-lived assets are reviewed when there is an indication that impairment may have occurred. Changes in market conditions or other changes in the future outlook of value may lead to impairment charges in the future. In addition, we may from time to time sell assets that we determine are not critical to our strategy, including in connection with certain strategic exits. Future events or decisions may lead to asset impairments and/or related charges. Certain non-cash impairments may result from a change in our strategic goals, business direction or other factors relating to the overall business environment. Material impairment charges could negatively affect our results of operations.  For more information on the valuation and impairment of long-lived assets, refer to the discussion under the caption entitled “Critical Accounting Policies” in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect our business and financial condition.Our ability to generate cash flows from operations could be affected if there is a material decline in the demand for our products, in the solvency of our customers or suppliers, or deterioration in our key financial ratios or credit ratings. Current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of our customers (including governments) to pay for our products and services, and the amount spent on healthcare generally. This could result in a decrease in the demand for our products and services, declining cash flows, longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. These conditions may also adversely affect certain of our suppliers, which could cause a disruption in our ability to produce our products. We continue to do business with foreign governments in certain countries, including Greece, Spain, Portugal, and Italy, which have experienced deterioration in credit and economic conditions. As of December 31, 2018, our net accounts receivable from the public sector in Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy totaled $130 million. While global economic conditions have not significantly impacted our ability to collect receivables, liquidity issues in certain countries have resulted, and may continue to result, in delays in the collection of receivables and credit losses. These conditions may also impact the stability of the U.S. dollar, Euro or Yuan. For more information on accounts receivable 12 and credit matters with respect to certain of these countries, refer to the discussion under the caption entitled “Credit Facilities, Access to Capital and Credit Ratings” in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We may incur operational difficulties or be exposed to claims and liabilities as a result of the separation and distribution of Baxalta.On July 1, 2015, we distributed approximately 80.5% of the outstanding shares of Baxalta common stock to Baxter stockholders in connection with the separation of our biopharmaceuticals business. We disposed of our remaining 19.5% stake in Baxalta (Retained Shares) in 2016, in connection with a series of transactions including debt-for-equity exchanges, an equity-for-equity exchange and a contribution to our U.S. pension plan (Retained Shares Transactions). Shire plc (Shire) acquired Baxalta in June 2016, after completion of the last Retained Shares Transaction and in January 2019, Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (Takeda) acquired Shire.  In connection with the July 2015 distribution, we entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements (including a tax matters agreement, a long term services agreement, a manufacturing and supply agreement, a trademark license agreement, a Galaxy license agreement, an international commercial operations agreement and certain other commercial agreements) with Baxalta. These agreements govern the separation and distribution and the relationship between the companies going forward, including with respect to potential tax-related losses associated with the separation and distribution and the Retained Shares Transactions. They also provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time (including under the manufacturing and supply agreement pursuant to which Shire now manufactures and sells certain products and materials to us).The separation and distribution agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make Baxalta financially responsible for many liabilities that may exist relating to its business activities, whether incurred prior to or after the distribution, including any pending or future litigation.  In addition, the separation and distribution agreement provides for certain indemnification obligations of Baxter, which may be significant.  It is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between us and Baxalta and require us to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to Baxalta. Third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of these liabilities or obligations, and we may be unsuccessful in obtaining indemnification or the indemnity rights we have under the separation and distribution agreement may not be sufficient to fully cover all of these liabilities and obligations. Even if we are successful in obtaining indemnification, we may have to bear costs.  These risks could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.The separation and distribution of Baxalta continues to involve a number of risks, including, among other things, the indemnification risks described above. Certain of the agreements described above provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time. Takeda may elect to extend the term for which we provide services to Baxalta under these agreements. If Baxalta is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements, including its indemnification obligations, we could incur losses. These arrangements could also lead to disputes over rights to certain shared property and over the allocation of costs and revenues for products and operations. There could be significant liability if the separation and distribution or any Retained Shares Transaction is determined to be a taxable transaction. Baxalta has indemnified us for certain potential liabilities that may arise, and such indemnification obligation is guaranteed by Shire, but Baxalta and Shire may be unable to satisfy their indemnification obligations to us in the future.The separation and distribution and the Retained Shares Transactions (collectively, the Baxter Transactions) qualify for tax-free treatment to Baxter and its stockholders under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). Completion of the separation and distribution was conditioned upon, among other things, the receipt of a private letter ruling from the IRS regarding certain issues relating to the tax-free treatment of the Baxter Transactions. Although the IRS private letter ruling is generally binding on the IRS, the continuing validity of such ruling is subject to the accuracy of factual representations and assumptions made in the ruling. Completion of the distribution was also conditioned upon Baxter’s receipt of a tax opinion from KPMG LLP regarding certain aspects of the Baxalta separation not covered by the IRS private letter ruling. The opinion was based upon various factual representations and assumptions, as well as certain undertakings made by Baxter and Baxalta. If any of the factual representations or assumptions in the IRS private letter ruling or tax opinion is untrue or incomplete in any material respect, if any undertaking is not complied with, or if the facts upon which the IRS private letter ruling or tax opinion are based are materially different from the actual facts relating to the Baxter Transactions, the opinion or IRS private letter ruling may not be valid. Moreover, opinions of a tax advisor are not binding on the IRS. As a result, the conclusions expressed in the opinion of a tax advisor could be successfully challenged by the IRS.If the Baxter Transactions are determined to be taxable, Baxter and its stockholders could incur significant tax liabilities. Pursuant to the tax matters agreement, Baxalta agreed to indemnify us for certain tax-related losses incurred if Baxalta’s actions cause the separation and distribution and certain related transactions to fail to qualify for tax-free status under the applicable provisions of the Code.13 In anticipation of the merger between Baxalta and Shire (the Merger), we entered into a letter agreement with Shire and Baxalta (the Letter Agreement). Under the Letter Agreement, Baxalta agreed to indemnify, and Shire agreed to guarantee such indemnity to, Baxter and each of its affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors and employees against certain tax-related losses attributable to or resulting from (in whole or in part) the Merger as further described in the Letter Agreement. If the Baxter Transactions are determined to be taxable as a result (in whole or in part) of the Merger (for example, if the Merger is deemed to be part of a plan (or series of related transactions) that includes the Baxter Transactions, Baxter and its stockholders could incur significant tax liabilities. Although Baxalta and Shire may be required to indemnify Baxter under the tax matters agreement and the Letter Agreement for any such tax liabilities incurred by Baxter, there can be no assurance that the indemnity from Baxalta or the guarantee thereof by Shire will be sufficient to protect us against all or a part of the amount of such liabilities, or that either Baxalta or Shire will fully satisfy their respective obligations.Even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Baxalta or Shire any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be required to bear these costs initially, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  "
16,BAX,BAXTER INTERNATIONAL INC,2018-02-23,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
.In addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, stockholders or prospective investors should carefully consider the following risk factors. If any of the events described below occurs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, future growth prospects and stock price could suffer.We may not achieve our long-term financial improvement goals.We have been implementing plans to enhance profitability and returns for our stockholders. These plans include the achievement of certain financial goals (including improved operating margin and earnings per share) in 2018 and beyond. While we are continuing to refine these goals, our plan contemplates significant margin expansion over our long-range plan, which runs through 2020. We have identified certain key strategies to help achieve these targets. These strategies include optimizing our core product portfolio globally, driving operational excellence through the realignment of our cost structure and various restructuring activities and maximizing the value derived from the allocation of our capital.As part of these strategies, we continue to evaluate the performance of all of our businesses and may sell or acquire a business or product line or exit a particular market. We are also evaluating our corporate and commercial infrastructure in the interest of streamlining costs while maintaining our commitment to quality and safety. Future divestitures may result in significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets. Future acquisitions may fail to achieve the desired financial results (including return on investment) and synergies and may not provide the desired market access. The restructuring of our operations may not generate targeted savings or may cause unexpected disruptions to our business. As a result, we may not achieve our targeted financial results, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.If we are unable to successfully introduce new products or fail to keep pace with advances in technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.We need to successfully introduce new products to achieve our strategic business objectives. Product development requires substantial investment and there is inherent risk in the R&D process. A successful product development process depends on many factors, including our ability to properly anticipate and satisfy customer needs, adapt to new technologies, obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis, demonstrate satisfactory clinical results, manufacture products in an economical and timely manner and differentiate our products from those of our competitors. If we cannot successfully introduce new products or adapt to changing technologies, our products may become obsolete and our revenue and profitability could suffer.Issues with product supply or quality could have an adverse effect upon our business, subject us to regulatory actions, cause a loss of customer confidence in us or our products, among other negative consequences.Our success depends upon the availability and quality of our products. The medical products industry is competitive and subject to complex market dynamics and varying demand levels. These levels vary in response to macro-economic conditions, regulatory requirements (including the availability of private or public reimbursement), seasonality, natural disasters, epidemics and other matters. Additionally the development of new or enhanced products involves a lengthy regulatory process and is capital intensive. As a result, our ability to match our production levels and capacity to market demand is imprecise and may result in a failure to meet market demand or satisfy customer requirements for our products or, alternatively, an oversupply of inventory. Failure to meet market demand may result in customers transitioning to available competitive products, loss of market share, negative publicity, reputational damage, loss of customer confidence or other negative consequences (including a decline in stock price). In the event of an oversupply, we may be forced to lower our prices or record asset impairment charges or take other action which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Additionally, quality management plays an essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements, preventing defects, improving the company’s products and services and assuring the safety and efficacy of our products. Our future success depends on our ability to maintain and continuously improve our quality management program. While we have a quality system that covers the 5 lifecycle of our products, quality and safety issues may occur with respect to any of our products. A quality or safety issue may result in adverse inspection reports, voluntary or official action indicated, warning letters, import bans, product recalls (either voluntary or required by the FDA or similar governmental authorities in other countries) or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, costly litigation, refusal of a government to grant approvals and licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. An inability to address a quality or safety issue in an effective and timely manner may also cause negative publicity, a loss of customer confidence in us or our current or future products, which may result in the loss of sales and difficulty in successfully launching new products. Additionally, Baxter has made and continues to make significant investments in assets, including inventory and property, plant and equipment, which relate to potential new products or modifications to existing products. Product quality or safety issues may restrict the company from being able to realize the expected returns from these investments, potentially resulting in asset impairments in the future.Unaffiliated third party suppliers provide a number of goods and services to our R&D, clinical and manufacturing organizations. Third party suppliers are required to comply with our quality standards. Failure of a third party supplier to provide compliant raw materials or supplies could result in delays, service interruptions or other quality related issues that may negatively impact our business results. For more information on regulatory matters currently affecting us, refer to the discussion under the caption entitled “Certain Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.If we are unable to obtain sufficient components or raw materials on a timely basis or for a cost-effective price or if we experience other manufacturing or supply difficulties, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.The manufacture of our products requires, among other things, the timely supply or delivery of sufficient amounts of quality components and materials. We manufacture our products in approximately 50 manufacturing facilities around the world. We acquire our components, materials and other requirements for manufacturing from many suppliers and vendors in various countries, including sometimes from ourselves for self-supplied requirements. We endeavor, either alone or working closely with our suppliers, to ensure the continuity of our inputs and supplies but we cannot guarantee these efforts will always be successful. Further, while efforts are made to diversify certain of our sources of components and materials, in certain instances there is only a sole source or supplier with no alternatives yet identified. For most of our components and materials for which a single source or supplier is used, alternative sources or suppliers may exist, but we have made a strategic determination to use the single source or supplier. Although we do carry strategic inventory and maintain insurance to help mitigate the potential risk related to any related supply disruption, there can be no assurance that such measures will be sufficient or effective. A reduction or interruption in supply and an inability to quickly develop acceptable alternative sources for such supply, could adversely affect our ability to manufacture and distribute our products in a timely or cost-effective manner, and our ability to make product sales.  Additionally, volatility in our costs of energy, transportation/freight, components, raw materials and other supply, manufacturing and distribution costs could adversely affect our results of operations. Climate change (including laws or regulations passed in response thereto) could increase our costs, in particular our costs of supply, energy and transportation/freight. Material or sustained increases in the price of oil could have an adverse impact on the cost of many of the plastic materials we use to make and package our products, as well as our transportation/freight costs. These outcomes may in turn result in customers transitioning to available competitive products, loss of market share, negative publicity, reputational damage, loss of customer confidence or other negative consequences (including a decline in stock price).Many of our products are difficult to manufacture. This is due to the complex nature of manufacturing pharmaceuticals, including biologics, and devices, as well as the strict regulatory regime governing our manufacturing operations. Variations in the manufacturing process may result in production failures which could lead to launch delays, product shortage, unanticipated costs, lost revenues and damage to our reputation. A failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers may also result in a quality or safety issue of the type discussed above.Some of our products are manufactured at a single manufacturing facility or stored at a single storage site. Loss or damage to a manufacturing facility or storage site due to a natural disaster or otherwise could adversely affect our ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of key products or otherwise deliver products to meet customer demand or contractual requirements which may result in a loss of revenue and other adverse business consequences (including those identified in the paragraph above). Because of the time required to approve and license a manufacturing facility, a third party manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis (if at all) to replace production capacity in the event we lose manufacturing capacity or products are otherwise unavailable due to natural disaster, regulatory action or otherwise.6 We are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and subject to privacy and security laws, and our systems and infrastructure face certain risks, including from cyber security breaches and data leakage.We increasingly rely upon technology systems and infrastructure, including support provided by our partners and third parties, to support our business, our products and our customers.  For example, we routinely rely on our technology systems and infrastructure to aid us in the collection, use, storage and transfer, disclosure and other processing of voluminous amounts of data (including confidential, business, personal and other sensitive information).    We also rely on systems for manufacturing, customer orders, shipping, regulatory compliance and various other matters. Certain of our products collect data regarding patients and their therapy and some connect to our systems for maintenance and other purposes.The increasing use and evolution of technology, including cloud-based computing, and reliance on third parties creates additional opportunities for the unintentional, intentional and/or unauthorized exposure, dissemination and/or destruction of confidential information stored in our technology systems, infrastructure and products. Our products, devices, computer systems, servers and other technology systems (and those of third parties that we use) are vulnerable to breakdown, interruption, cyber and other security attacks, system malfunction, unauthorized access and other events.  Security threats, including cyber and other attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, frequent, and adaptive. Any such vulnerability could compromise our technology systems and infrastructure and could expose personal and/or proprietary information (including sensitive personal information) to unauthorized third parties and/or cause permanent loss of such data.  In addition to loss of data, unauthorized access to or interference with our products that utilize cloud-based computing or otherwise send and receive data may cause product functionality issues that may result in risk to patient safety, field actions and/or product recalls. While we have invested in the protection of data and information technology, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns, breaches in our systems or other incidents or ensure compliance with all applicable security and privacy laws, regulations and standards.  Such breakdowns can lead to regulatory fines and penalties, business disruption, reputational harm, financial loss as well as other damages.  We could also suffer strained relationships with customers and business partners, increased costs (for security measures, remediation or otherwise), litigation (including class actions and stockholder derivative actions) or other negative consequences (including a decline in stock price) from breaches, cyber and other security attacks, industrial espionage, ransomware, email or phishing scams, malware or other cyber incidents, which may compromise our system infrastructure or lead to data leakage, either internally or at our third-party providers or other business partners.  While we have invested in the protection of data and information technology and in related training, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent significant breakdowns, attacks, breaches in our systems or other cyber incidents or ensure compliance with all applicable security and privacy laws, regulations and standards, including with respect to third-party service providers that utilize sensitive personal information, including protected health information (PHI), on our behalf.Additionally, the legal and regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the imposition of new and changing requirements across businesses. We are required to comply with increasingly complex and changing legal and regulatory requirements that govern the collection, use, storage, security, transfer, disclosure and other processing of personal data, including The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).  In May 2018, the GDPR will supersede current European Union data protection legislation, impose more stringent European Union data protection requirements, and provide for greater penalties for noncompliance.  We or our third-party providers and business partners may also be subjected to audits or investigations by one or more domestic or foreign government agencies relating to compliance with information security and privacy laws and regulations. In addition, significant implementation issues may arise as we continue to consolidate and outsource certain computer operations and application support activities. We also face all of the same risks listed above and other heightened risks when acquiring a company, in particular if we need to transition or implement certain processes or controls with the acquired company.We are subject to a number of existing laws and regulations, non-compliance with which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and we are susceptible to a changing regulatory environment.As a participant in the healthcare industry, our operations and products, and those of our customers, are regulated by numerous government agencies, both inside and outside the United States. The impact of this on us is direct to the extent we are subject to these laws and regulations, and indirect in that in a number of situations, even though we may not be directly regulated by specific healthcare laws and regulations, our products must be capable of being used by our customers in a manner that complies with those laws and regulations.The manufacture, distribution, marketing and use of our products are subject to extensive regulation and scrutiny by FDA and other regulatory authorities globally. Any new product must undergo lengthy and rigorous testing and other extensive, costly and time-consuming procedures mandated by FDA and foreign regulatory authorities. The same testing and procedures sometimes apply to 7 current products that are up for authorization renewal or are subject to changes in law or regulation (for example certain of our medical devices will have to comply with the new European Union Medical Device Regulation). Changes to current products may be subject to vigorous review, including additional 510(k) and other regulatory submissions, and approvals are not certain. Our facilities must be approved and licensed prior to production and remain subject to inspection from time to time thereafter. Failure to comply with the requirements of FDA or other regulatory authorities, including a failed inspection or a failure in our adverse event reporting system, could result in adverse inspection reports, voluntary or official action indicated, warning letters, import bans, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt the manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a government to grant approvals or licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. Any of these actions could cause a loss of customer confidence in us and our products, which could adversely affect our sales. The requirements of regulatory authorities, including interpretative guidance, are subject to change and compliance with additional or changing requirements or interpretative guidance may subject the company to further review, result in product launch delays or otherwise increase our costs. For information on current regulatory issues affecting us, please refer to the caption entitled “Certain Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In connection with these issues, there can be no assurance that additional costs or civil and criminal penalties will not be incurred, that additional regulatory actions with respect to the company will not occur, that the company will not face civil claims for damages from purchasers or users, that substantial additional charges or significant asset impairments may not be required, that sales of other products may not be adversely affected, or that additional regulation will not be introduced that may adversely affect the company’s operations and consolidated financial statements.The sales, marketing and pricing of products and relationships that pharmaceutical and medical device companies have with healthcare providers are under increased scrutiny by federal, state and foreign government agencies. Compliance with the Anti-Kickback Statute, False Claims Act, Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (including as these laws relate to off-label promotion of products) and other healthcare related laws, as well as competition, data and patient privacy and export and import laws, is under increased focus by the agencies charged with overseeing such activities, including FDA, OIG, DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission. The DOJ and the Securities and Exchange Commission have also increased their focus on the enforcement of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), particularly as it relates to the conduct of pharmaceutical and medical product companies. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their employees, contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Healthcare professionals in many countries are employed by the government and consequently may be considered government officials. Foreign governments have also increased their scrutiny of pharmaceutical and medical product companies’ sales and marketing activities and relationships with healthcare providers and competitive practices generally. The laws and standards governing the promotion, sale and reimbursement of our products and those governing our relationships with healthcare providers and governments, including the Sunshine Act enacted under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (as amended, the PPACA), can be complicated, are subject to frequent change and may be violated unknowingly. Additionally, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Control and the Bureau of Industry and Security at the U.S. Department of Commerce administer laws and regulations that restrict U.S. persons and, in some instances, non-U.S. persons, in conducting activities, transacting business or making investments in certain countries, governments, entities and individuals subject to U.S. economic sanctions. From time to time, certain of our subsidiaries have limited business dealings in countries subject to these sanctions, including Iran, Sudan, Syria, Russia and Cuba. These dealings represent an insignificant amount of our consolidated revenues and income but expose us to an increased risk of violating applicable sanctions regulations, which are complex and subject to frequent change. Additional restrictions may be enacted, enforced or interpreted in a way that may adversely affect our operations.We have compliance programs in place, including policies, training and various forms of monitoring, designed to address the risks discussed above. Nonetheless, these programs and policies may not always protect us from conduct by individual employees that violate these laws. Violations or allegations of violations of these laws may result in large civil and criminal penalties, debarment from participating in government programs, diversion of management time, attention and resources and may otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For more information related to the company’s ongoing government investigations, please refer to Note 16 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.The laws and regulations discussed above are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial cost associated with compliance or to alter one or more of our sales and marketing practices and may subject us to enforcement actions which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.If reimbursement or other payment for our current or future products is reduced or modified in the United States or abroad, including through the implementation or repeal of government-sponsored healthcare reform or other similar actions, cost containment measures, or changes to policies with respect to pricing, taxation or rebates, then our business could suffer.Sales of our products depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our products are paid by both public and private payers. These payers include Medicare, Medicaid, and private healthcare insurers in the United States and foreign governments and third-party payers outside the United States. Public and private payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products 8 and services. We may continue to experience downward pricing pressures from any or all of these payers which could result in an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operational results.Global efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing. Governments around the world use various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures such as price controls, the formation of public contracting authorities, product formularies (lists of recommended or approved products), and competitive tenders which require the submission of a bid to sell products. Sales of our products are dependent, in part, on the availability of reimbursement by government agencies and healthcare programs, as well as insurance companies and other private payers. In much of Europe, Latin America, Asia and Australia, for example, the government provides healthcare at low cost to patients, and controls its expenditures by purchasing products through public tenders, collective purchasing, regulating prices, setting reference prices in public tenders or limiting reimbursement or patient access to certain products. Additionally, austerity measures or other reforms by foreign governments may limit, reduce or eliminate payments for our products and adversely affect both pricing flexibility and demand for our products.The PPACA includes several provisions which impact our businesses in the United States, including increased Medicaid rebates and an expansion of the 340B Drug Pricing Program which provides certain qualified entities, such as hospitals serving disadvantaged populations, with discounts on the purchase of drugs for outpatient use and an excise tax on the sale of certain drugs. The PPACA reduces Medicare and Medicaid payments to hospitals and other providers, which may cause us to experience downward pricing pressure. Certain portions of the PPACA, including Sections 2501(a), 2501(b) and 7101(a), could negatively impact the demand for our products, and therefore our results of operations and financial position. It is uncertain what impact the current U.S. presidential administration might have on coverage, reimbursement and other matters related to the PPACA and/or healthcare reform in general, including the timing and speed of any such impact. As a result of these and other measures, including future measures or reforms that cannot be predicted, reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive basis. Legislation and regulations affecting reimbursement for our products may change at any time and in ways that may be adverse to us. We cannot predict the impact of these pressures and initiatives, or any negative effects of any additional regulations that may affect our business.There is substantial competition in the product markets in which we operate.Although no single company competes with us in all of our businesses, we face substantial competition in all of our markets from international and domestic healthcare and pharmaceutical companies and providers of all sizes, and these competitors often differ across our businesses. Competition is primarily focused on cost-effectiveness, price, service, product performance, and technological innovation.Competition may increase further as additional companies begin to enter our markets or modify their existing products to compete directly with ours. If our competitors respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or we do not introduce new versions or upgrades to our product portfolio in response to those requirements, our products may be rendered obsolete or non-competitive. If our competitors develop more effective or affordable products, or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than we do, our operations will likely be negatively affected. If we are forced to reduce our prices due to increased competition, our business could become less profitable. The company’s sales could be adversely affected if any of its contracts with GPOs, IDNs or other customers are terminated due to increased competition or otherwise.If our business development activities are unsuccessful, our business could suffer and our financial performance could be adversely affected.As part of our long-term strategy, we are engaged in business development activities including evaluating acquisitions, joint development opportunities, technology licensing arrangements and other opportunities. These activities may result in substantial investment of the company’s resources. Our success developing products or expanding into new markets from such activities will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to find suitable opportunities for acquisition, investment or alliance; whether we are able to complete an acquisition, investment or alliance on terms that are satisfactory to us; the strength of the other company’s underlying technology, products and ability to execute its business strategies; any intellectual property and litigation related to these products or technology; and our ability to successfully integrate the acquired company, business, product, technology or research into our existing operations, including the ability to adequately fund acquired in-process R&D projects and to maintain adequate controls over the combined operations. Certain of these activities are subject to antitrust and competition laws, which laws could impact our ability to pursue strategic transactions and could result in mandated divestitures in the context of proposed acquisitions. If we are unsuccessful in our business development activities, we may be unable to meet our financial targets and our financial performance could be adversely affected.9 For more information on recent business development activities, see Note 5 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.If we are unable to protect our patents or other proprietary rights, or if we infringe the patents or other proprietary rights of others, our competitiveness and business prospects may be materially damaged.Patent and other proprietary rights are essential to our business. Our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain and enforce patents and licenses to patent rights, both in the United States and in other countries. We cannot guarantee that pending patent applications will result in issued patents, that patents issued or licensed will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, that our patents will not be found to be invalid or that the intellectual property rights of others will not prevent the company from selling certain products or including key features in the company’s products.The patent position of a healthcare company is often uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. Significant litigation concerning patents and products is pervasive in our industry. Patent claims include challenges to the coverage and validity of our patents on products or processes as well as allegations that our products infringe patents held by competitors or other third parties. A loss in any of these types of cases could result in a loss of patent protection or the ability to market products, which could lead to a significant loss of sales, or otherwise materially affect future results of operations. We also rely on trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and know-how to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive positions. Third parties may know, discover or independently develop equivalent proprietary information or techniques, or they may gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our trade secrets to the public.Although our employees, consultants, parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners are generally subject to confidentiality or similar agreements to protect our confidential and proprietary information, these agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. To the extent that our employees, consultants, parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.Furthermore, our intellectual property, other proprietary technology and other sensitive company data is potentially vulnerable to loss, damage or misappropriation from system malfunction, computer viruses, unauthorized access to our data or misappropriation or misuse thereof by those with permitted access and other events. While we have invested to protect our intellectual property, confidential information and other data, and continue to work diligently in this area, there can be no assurance that our precautionary measures will prevent breakdowns, breaches, cyber incidents or other events. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.Misappropriation or other loss of our intellectual property from any of the foregoing would have an adverse effect on our competitive position and may cause us to incur substantial litigation costs.We are subject to risks associated with doing business globally.Our operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business globally and under the laws, regulations and customs of various jurisdictions and geographies. These risks include changes in exchange controls and other governmental actions, loss of business in government and public tenders that are held annually in many cases, increasingly complex labor environments, availability of raw materials, changes in taxation, export control restrictions, changes in or violations of U.S. or local laws, including the FCPA and the United Kingdom Bribery Act, dependence on a few government entities as customers, pricing restrictions, economic and political instability, monetary or currency volatility or instability (including as it relates to the U.S. dollar, the Euro, the Yuan and currencies in emerging market countries), disputes between countries, diminished or insufficient protection of intellectual property, and disruption or destruction of operations in a significant geographic region regardless of cause, including natural disaster, pandemic, power loss, cyber attack, data breach, war, terrorism, riot, labor disruption, civil insurrection or social unrest. Failure to comply with, or material changes to, the laws and regulations that affect our global operations could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. The 2016 referendum by British voters to exit the European Union (EU) (commonly known as Brexit) and the UK government’s subsequent initiation of the withdrawal process has created uncertainties affecting business operations in the EU.  Withdrawal by the UK could result in the deterioration of economic conditions, volatility in currency exchange rates, and increased regulatory complexities.  These outcomes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.10 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and liquidity.We generate the majority of our revenue and profit outside the United States. As a result, our financial results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or our ability to mitigate these risks. We may experience additional volatility as a result of inflationary pressures and other macroeconomic factors, including in emerging market countries. We are also exposed to changes in interest rates, and our ability to access the money markets and capital markets could be impeded if adverse liquidity market conditions occur. A discussion of the financial impact of foreign exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations, and the ways and extent to which we attempt to mitigate such impact is contained under the caption “Financial Instrument Market Risk” in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities may have a negative impact on our operating results.Changes to the tax laws in the United States or other countries in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our operating results.  In particular, the recently-enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Tax Reform), including, among other things, certain changes in tax rates, deductibility of interest, deductibility of executive compensation expense, expensing of capital expenditures, the ability to use certain tax credits, taxation on earnings from international business operations, and the system of taxation (from worldwide to territorial) could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.  In certain instances, Tax Reform could have a negative effect on our tax rate and the carrying value of deferred tax balances.  Any of these changes could adversely affect our financial performance.  There remains some uncertainty regarding the implementation of such Tax Reform and its impact on us.  We cannot currently predict the full impact of Tax Reform on our business, including revenues, profit margins, profitability, operating cash flows and results of operations. For more information regarding the company’s provisional estimate of the impact of Tax Reform, see Note 15 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Taxing authorities may audit us from time to time and disagree with certain positions we have taken in respect of our tax liabilities.  Our tax liabilities are affected by many factors, including the amounts we charge in intercompany transactions for inventory, services, licenses, funding and other items. Because we operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States, cross border transactions among our affiliates are a significant part of the manner in which we operate. Although we believe that we transact intercompany business in accordance with arms-length principles, tax authorities may disagree with our intercompany charges, cross-jurisdictional transfer pricing or other matters, and may assess additional taxes as a result.We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. However, we may not accurately predict the outcome of these audits, and as a result the actual outcome of these audits may have an adverse impact on our financial results. For more information on ongoing audits, see Note 15 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.If we fail to attract and retain key employees our business may suffer.Our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees, including people in senior management, sales, marketing and research positions. Competition for top talent in healthcare can be intense. Our ability to recruit and retain such talent will depend on a number of factors, including hiring practices of our competitors, compensation and benefits, work location, work environment and industry economic conditions. If we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified employees, our business could suffer.We are party to a number of pending lawsuits and other disputes which may have an adverse impact on our business, operations or financial condition.We are party to a number of pending lawsuits, settlement discussions, mediations, arbitrations and other disputes. In addition, in the future we may be party to such disputes, including patent, product liability or other lawsuits. These current and future matters may result in a loss of patent protection, reduced revenue, incurrence of significant liabilities and diversion of our management’s time, attention and resources. Given the uncertain nature of litigation and other disputes generally, we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in these current matters. In view of these uncertainties, the outcome of these matters may result in charges in excess of any established reserves, and, to the extent available, liability insurance. We also continue to be self-insured with respect to product liability claims. The absence of third-party insurance coverage for current or future claims increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims and adverse decisions. Protracted litigation and other disputes, including any adverse outcomes, may have an adverse impact on the business, operations or financial condition of the company. Even claims without merit could subject us to adverse publicity and require us to incur significant legal fees. See Note 16 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding current lawsuits.  11  Our operating results and financial condition may fluctuate. Our operating results and financial condition may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year for a number of reasons. Events such as a delay in product development, changes to our expectations or strategy or even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause financial results for a period to be below our expectations or projections. As a result, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful, and these comparisons should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance. Our operating results and financial condition are also subject to fluctuation from all of the risks described throughout this section. These fluctuations may adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditions and our stock price. Future material impairments in the value of our long-lived assets, including goodwill, could negatively affect our operating results. We regularly review our long-lived assets, including identifiable intangible assets, goodwill (which results from our acquisition activity) and property, plant and equipment, for impairment. Goodwill and acquired indefinite life intangible assets are subject to impairment review on an annual basis and whenever potential impairment indicators are present. Other long-lived assets are reviewed when there is an indication that impairment may have occurred. Changes in market conditions or other changes in the future outlook of value may lead to impairment charges in the future. In addition, we may from time to time sell assets that we determine are not critical to our strategy, including in connection with our strategic exits. Future events or decisions may lead to asset impairments and/or related charges. Certain non-cash impairments may result from a change in our strategic goals, business direction or other factors relating to the overall business environment. Material impairment charges could negatively affect our results of operations.  For more information on the valuation and impairment of long-lived assets, refer to the discussion under the caption entitled “Critical Accounting Policies” in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect our business and financial condition.The company’s ability to generate cash flows from operations could be affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company’s products, in the solvency of its customers or suppliers, or deterioration in the company’s key financial ratios or credit ratings. Current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of our customers (including governments) to pay for our products and services, and the amount spent on healthcare generally. This could result in a decrease in the demand for our products and services, declining cash flows, longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. These conditions may also adversely affect certain of our suppliers, which could cause a disruption in our ability to produce our products. We continue to do business with foreign governments in certain countries, including Greece, Spain, Portugal, and Italy, which have experienced deterioration in credit and economic conditions. As of December 31, 2017, the company’s net accounts receivable from the public sector in Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy totaled $149 million. While global economic conditions have not significantly impacted the company’s ability to collect receivables, liquidity issues in certain countries have resulted, and may continue to result, in delays in the collection of receivables and credit losses. These conditions may also impact the stability of the U.S. dollar, Euro or Yuan. For more information on accounts receivable and credit matters with respect to certain of these countries, refer to the discussion under the caption entitled “Credit Facilities, Access to Capital and Credit Ratings” in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We may incur operational difficulties or be exposed to claims and liabilities as a result of the separation and distribution of Baxalta.On July 1, 2015, we distributed approximately 80.5% of the outstanding shares of Baxalta common stock to Baxter stockholders in connection with the separation of our biopharmaceuticals business. We disposed of our remaining 19.5% stake in Baxalta (Retained Shares) in 2016, in connection with a series of transactions including debt-for-equity exchanges, an equity-for-equity exchange and a contribution to our U.S. pension plan (Retained Shares Transactions). Shire plc (Shire) acquired Baxalta in June 2016, after completion of the last Retained Shares Transaction. In connection with the July 2015 distribution, we entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements (including a tax matters agreement, a long term services agreement, a manufacturing and supply agreement, a trademark license agreement, a Galaxy license agreement, an international commercial operations agreement and certain other commercial agreements) with Baxalta. These agreements govern the separation and distribution and the relationship between the companies going forward, including with respect to potential tax-related losses associated with the separation and distribution and the Retained Shares Transactions. They also provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time (including under the manufacturing and supply agreement pursuant to which Shire now manufactures and sells certain products and materials to us).The separation and distribution agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make Baxalta financially responsible for many liabilities that may exist relating to its business activities, whether incurred prior to or after the distribution, including any pending or future litigation. It is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between us and Baxalta and require us 12 to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to Baxalta. Third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of these liabilities or obligations, and the indemnity rights we have under the separation and distribution agreement may not be sufficient to fully cover all of these liabilities and obligations. Even if we are successful in obtaining indemnification, we may have to bear costs. In addition, our indemnity obligations to Baxalta may be significant. These risks could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.The separation and distribution of Baxalta continues to involve a number of risks, including, among other things, the indemnification risks described above. Certain of the agreements described above provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time. Shire may elect to extend the term for which we provide services to Baxalta under these agreements. If Baxalta is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements, including its indemnification obligations, we could incur losses. These arrangements could also lead to disputes over rights to certain shared property and over the allocation of costs and revenues for products and operations. There could be significant liability if the separation and distribution or any Retained Shares Transaction is determined to be a taxable transaction. Baxalta has indemnified us for certain potential liabilities that may arise, and such indemnification obligation is guaranteed by Shire, but Baxalta and Shire may be unable to satisfy their indemnification obligations to us in the future.The separation and distribution and the Retained Shares Transactions (collectively, the Baxter Transactions) qualify for tax-free treatment to Baxter and its stockholders under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). Completion of the separation and distribution was conditioned upon, among other things, the receipt of a private letter ruling from the IRS regarding certain issues relating to the tax-free treatment of the Baxter Transactions. Although the IRS private letter ruling is generally binding on the IRS, the continuing validity of such ruling is subject to the accuracy of factual representations and assumptions made in the ruling. Completion of the distribution was also conditioned upon Baxter’s receipt of a tax opinion from KPMG LLP regarding certain aspects of the Baxalta spin-off not covered by the IRS private letter ruling. The opinion was based upon various factual representations and assumptions, as well as certain undertakings made by Baxter and Baxalta. If any of the factual representations or assumptions in the IRS private letter ruling or tax opinion is untrue or incomplete in any material respect, if any undertaking is not complied with, or if the facts upon which the IRS private letter ruling or tax opinion are based are materially different from the actual facts relating to the Baxter Transactions, the opinion or IRS private letter ruling may not be valid. Moreover, opinions of a tax advisor are not binding on the IRS. As a result, the conclusions expressed in the opinion of a tax advisor could be successfully challenged by the IRS.If the Baxter Transactions are determined to be taxable, Baxter and its stockholders could incur significant tax liabilities. Pursuant to the tax matters agreement, Baxalta agreed to indemnify us for certain tax-related losses incurred if Baxalta’s actions cause the separation and distribution and certain related transactions to fail to qualify for tax-free status under the applicable provisions of the Code.In anticipation of the proposed Baxalta — Shire merger (the Merger), we entered into a letter agreement with Shire and Baxalta (the Letter Agreement). Under the Letter Agreement, Baxalta agreed to indemnify, and Shire agreed to guarantee such indemnity to, Baxter and each of its affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors and employees against certain tax-related losses attributable to or resulting from (in whole or in part) the merger as further described in the Letter Agreement. If the Baxter Transactions are determined to be taxable as a result (in whole or in part) of the merger (for example, if the merger is deemed to be part of a plan (or series of related transactions) that includes the Baxter Transactions, Baxter and its stockholders could incur significant tax liabilities. Although Baxalta and Shire may be required to indemnify Baxter under the tax matters agreement and the Letter Agreement for any such tax liabilities incurred by Baxter, there can be no assurance that the indemnity from Baxalta or the guarantee thereof by Shire will be sufficient to protect us against all or a part of the amount of such liabilities, or that either Baxalta or Shire will be able to fully satisfy their respective obligations.Even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Baxalta or Shire any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be required to bear these costs, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  "
18,BAX,BAXTER INTERNATIONAL INC,2017-02-23,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
.In addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, stockholders or prospective investors should carefully consider the following risk factors. If any of the events described below occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations and future growth prospects could suffer.Risks Related to Baxter’s BusinessWe may not achieve our long-term financial improvement goals.We have begun implementing plans to enhance profitability and returns for our stockholders. These plans include the achievement of certain financial goals (including improved operating margin) in 2017 and beyond. While we are continuing to refine these goals, our plan contemplates significant margin expansion over our long-range plan, which runs through 2020. We have identified certain key strategies to help achieve these targets. These strategies include optimizing our core product portfolio globally, driving operational excellence through the rebasing of our cost structure and various restructuring activities and maximizing the value derived from the allocation of our capital.As part of these strategies, we continue to evaluate the performance of all of our businesses and may sell or acquire a business or product line or exit a particular market. We are also evaluating our corporate and commercial infrastructure in the interest of streamlining costs while maintaining our commitment to quality and safety. Future divestitures may result in significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets. Future acquisitions may fail to achieve the desired financial results (including return on investment) and synergies and may not provide the desired market access. The restructuring of our operations may not generate targeted savings or may cause unexpected disruptions to our business. As a result, we may not achieve our targeted financial results, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.If we are unable to successfully introduce new products or fail to keep pace with advances in technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.We need to successfully introduce new products to achieve our strategic business objectives. Product development requires substantial investment and there is inherent risk in the research and development process. A successful product development process depends on many factors, including our ability to properly anticipate and satisfy customer needs, adapt to new technologies, obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis, demonstrate satisfactory clinical results, manufacture products in an economical and timely manner and differentiate our products from those of our competitors. If we cannot successfully introduce new products or adapt to changing technologies, our products may become obsolete and our revenue and profitability could suffer.Issues with product supply or quality could have an adverse effect upon our business, subject us to regulatory actions and cause a loss of customer confidence in us or our products.Our success depends upon the availability and quality of our products. The medical products industry is competitive and subject to complex market dynamics and varying demand levels. These levels vary in response to macro-economic conditions, regulatory requirements (including the availability of private or public reimbursement) and seasonality. Additionally the development of new or enhanced products involves a lengthy regulatory process and is capital intensive. As a result, our ability to match our production levels and capacity to market demand is imprecise and may result in a failure to meet market demand or satisfy customer requirements for our products or, alternatively, an oversupply of inventory. Failure to meet market demand may result in customers transitioning to 5 available competitive products resulting in a loss of market share or customer confidence. In the event of an oversupply, we may be forced to lower our prices or record asset impairment charges or take other action which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.Additionally, quality management plays an essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements, preventing defects, improving the company’s products and services and assuring the safety and efficacy of our products. Our future success depends on our ability to maintain and continuously improve our quality management program. While we have a quality system that covers the lifecycle of our products, quality and safety issues may occur with respect to any of our products. A quality or safety issue may result in adverse inspection reports, warning letters, product recalls (either voluntary or required by the FDA or similar governmental authorities in other countries) or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, costly litigation, refusal of a government to grant approvals and licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. An inability to address a quality or safety issue in an effective and timely manner may also cause negative publicity, a loss of customer confidence in us or our current or future products, which may result in the loss of sales and difficulty in successfully launching new products. Additionally, Baxter has made and continues to make significant investments in assets, including inventory and property, plant and equipment, which relate to potential new products or modifications to existing products. Product quality or safety issues may restrict the company from being able to realize the expected returns from these investments, potentially resulting in asset impairments in the future.Unaffiliated third party suppliers provide a number of goods and services to our R&D, clinical and manufacturing organizations. Third party suppliers are required to comply with our quality standards. Failure of a third party supplier to provide compliant raw materials or supplies could result in delays, service interruptions or other quality related issues that may negatively impact our business results. For more information on regulatory matters currently affecting us, refer to the discussion under the caption entitled “Certain Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We are subject to a number of existing laws and regulations, non-compliance with which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and we are susceptible to a changing regulatory environment.As a participant in the healthcare industry, our operations and products, and those of our customers, are regulated by numerous government agencies, both inside and outside the United States. The impact of this on us is direct to the extent we are subject to these laws and regulations, and indirect in that in a number of situations, even though we may not be directly regulated by specific healthcare laws and regulations, our products must be capable of being used by our customers in a manner that complies with those laws and regulations.The manufacture, distribution, marketing and use of our products are subject to extensive regulation and scrutiny by FDA and other regulatory authorities globally. Any new product must undergo lengthy and rigorous testing and other extensive, costly and time-consuming procedures mandated by FDA and foreign regulatory authorities. Changes to current products may be subject to vigorous review, including additional 510(k) and other regulatory submissions, and approvals are not certain. Our facilities must be approved and licensed prior to production and remain subject to inspection from time to time thereafter. Failure to comply with the requirements of FDA or other regulatory authorities, including a failed inspection or a failure in our adverse event reporting system, could result in adverse inspection reports, warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt the manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a government to grant approvals or licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. Any of these actions could cause a loss of customer confidence in us and our products, which could adversely affect our sales. The requirements of regulatory authorities, including interpretative guidance, are subject to change and compliance with additional or changing requirements or interpretative guidance may subject the company to further review, result in product launch delays or otherwise increase our costs. For information on current regulatory issues affecting us, please refer to the caption entitled “Certain Regulatory Matters” in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In connection with these issues, there can be no assurance that additional costs or civil and criminal penalties will not be incurred, that additional regulatory actions with respect to the company will not occur, that the company will not face civil claims for damages from purchasers or users, that substantial additional charges or significant asset impairments may not be required, that sales of other products may not be adversely affected, or that additional regulation will not be introduced that may adversely affect the company’s operations and consolidated financial statements.The sales, marketing and pricing of products and relationships that pharmaceutical and medical device companies have with healthcare providers are under increased scrutiny by federal, state and foreign government agencies. Compliance with the Anti-Kickback Statute, False Claims Act, Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (including as these laws relate to off-label promotion of products) and other healthcare related laws, as well as competition, data and patient privacy and export and import laws, is under increased focus by the agencies charged with overseeing such activities, including FDA, OIG, DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission. The DOJ and the Securities and Exchange Commission have also increased their focus on the enforcement of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 6 (FCPA), particularly as it relates to the conduct of pharmaceutical and medical product companies. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their employees, contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Healthcare professionals in many countries are employed by the government and consequently may be considered government officials. Foreign governments have also increased their scrutiny of pharmaceutical and medical product companies’ sales and marketing activities and relationships with healthcare providers and competitive practices generally. The laws and standards governing the promotion, sale and reimbursement of our products and those governing our relationships with healthcare providers and governments, including the Sunshine Act enacted under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, can be complicated, are subject to frequent change and may be violated unknowingly. Additionally, the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Control and the Bureau of Industry and Security at the U.S. Department of Commerce administer laws and regulations that restrict U.S. persons and, in some instances, non-U.S. persons, in conducting activities, transacting business or making investments in certain countries, governments, entities and individuals subject to U.S. economic sanctions. From time to time, certain of our subsidiaries have limited business dealings in countries subject to these sanctions, including Iran, Sudan, Syria, Cuba, and Russia. These dealings represent an insignificant amount of our consolidated revenues and income but expose us to an increased risk of violating applicable sanctions regulations, which are complex and subject to frequent change. Additional restrictions may be enacted, enforced or interpreted in a way that may adversely affect our operations.We have compliance programs in place, including policies, training and various forms of monitoring, designed to address the risks discussed above. Nonetheless, these programs and policies may not always protect us from conduct by individual employees that violate these laws. Violations or allegations of violations of these laws may result in large civil and criminal penalties, debarment from participating in government programs, diversion of management time, attention and resources and may otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For more information related to the company’s ongoing government investigations, please refer to Note 16 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.The laws and regulations discussed above are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial cost associated with compliance or to alter one or more of our sales and marketing practices and may subject us to enforcement actions which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.If reimbursement or other payment for our current or future products is reduced or modified in the United States or abroad, including through the implementation of government-sponsored healthcare reform or other similar actions, cost containment measures, or changes to policies with respect to pricing, taxation or rebates, then our business could suffer.Sales of our products depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our products are paid by both public and private payers. These payers include Medicare, Medicaid, and private health care insurers in the United States and foreign governments and third-party payers outside the United States. Public and private payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. We may continue to experience continued downward pricing pressures from any or all of these payers which could result in an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operational results.Global efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing. Governments around the world use various mechanisms to control healthcare expenditures such as price controls, the formation of public contracting authorities, product formularies (lists of recommended or approved products), and competitive tenders which require the submission of a bid to sell products. Sales of our products are dependent, in part, on the availability of reimbursement by government agencies and healthcare programs, as well as insurance companies and other private payers. In much of Europe, Latin America, Asia and Australia, for example, the government provides healthcare at low cost to patients, and controls its expenditures by purchasing products through public tenders, collective purchasing, regulating prices, setting reference prices in public tenders or limiting reimbursement or patient access to certain products. Additionally, austerity measures or other reforms by foreign governments may limit, reduce or eliminate payments for our products and adversely affect both pricing flexibility and demand for our products.For example, in the United States the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), which was signed into law in March 2010, includes several provisions which impact our businesses in the United States, including increased Medicaid rebates and an expansion of the 340B Drug Pricing Program which provides certain qualified entities, such as hospitals serving disadvantaged populations, with discounts on the purchase of drugs for outpatient use and an excise tax on the sale of certain drugs. The PPACA reduces Medicare and Medicaid payments to hospitals and other providers, which may cause us to experience downward pricing pressure. Members of Congress and the Executive Branch have made statements suggesting plans to seek repeal of all or portions of the PPACA. Because of the continued uncertainty about the implementation of the PPACA, including the potential for legal challenges or repeal of that legislation, we cannot quantify or predict the likely impact of any change in or replacement of the PPACA on our business and the demand for our products.7 As a result of these and other measures, including future measures or reforms that cannot be predicted, reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive basis. Legislation and regulations affecting reimbursement for our products may change at any time and in ways that may be adverse to us. We cannot predict the impact of these pressures and initiatives, or any negative effects of any additional regulations that may affect our business.There is substantial competition in the product markets in which we operate.Although no single company competes with us in all of our businesses, we face substantial competition in both of our segments from international and domestic healthcare and pharmaceutical companies and providers of all sizes, and these competitors often differ across our businesses. Competition is primarily focused on cost-effectiveness, price, service, product performance, and technological innovation.Competition may increase further as additional companies begin to enter our markets or modify their existing products to compete directly with ours. If our competitors respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or we do not introduce new versions or upgrades to our product portfolio in response to those requirements, our products may be rendered obsolete or non-competitive. If our competitors develop more effective or affordable products, or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than we do, our operations will likely be negatively affected. If we are forced to reduce our prices due to increased competition, our business could become less profitable. The company’s sales could be adversely affected if any of its contracts with GPOs, IDNs or other customers are terminated due to increased competition or otherwise.If our business development activities are unsuccessful, our business could suffer and our financial performance could be adversely affected.As part of our long-term strategy, we are engaged in business development activities including evaluating acquisitions, joint development opportunities, technology licensing arrangements and other opportunities. These activities may result in substantial investment of the company’s resources. Our success developing products or expanding into new markets from such activities will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to find suitable opportunities for acquisition, investment or alliance; whether we are able to complete an acquisition, investment or alliance on terms that are satisfactory to us; the strength of the other company’s underlying technology, products and ability to execute its business strategies; any intellectual property and litigation related to these products or technology; and our ability to successfully integrate the acquired company, business, product, technology or research into our existing operations, including the ability to adequately fund acquired in-process research and development projects and to maintain adequate controls over the combined operations. Certain of these activities are subject to antitrust and competition laws, which laws could impact our ability to pursue strategic transactions and could result in mandated divestitures in the context of proposed acquisitions. If we are unsuccessful in our business development activities, we may be unable to meet our financial targets and our financial performance could be adversely affected.For more information on recent business development activities, see Note 5 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.If we are unable to obtain sufficient components or raw materials on a timely basis or if we experience other manufacturing or supply difficulties, our business may be adversely affected.The manufacture of our products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of quality components and materials. We manufacture our products in approximately 50 manufacturing facilities around the world. We acquire our components and materials from many suppliers in various countries. We work closely with our suppliers to ensure the continuity of supply but we cannot guarantee these efforts will always be successful. Further, while efforts are made to diversify our sources of components and materials, in certain instances we acquire components and materials from a sole supplier. For most of our components and materials for which a sole supplier is used, we believe that alternative sources of supply exist and have made a strategic determination to use a sole supplier. In very limited instances, however, we do rely upon sole supplier relationships for which no alternatives have currently been identified. Although we do carry strategic inventory and maintain insurance to mitigate the potential risk related to any related supply disruption, there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective. Due to the regulatory environment in which we operate, we may be unable to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for some components or materials. A reduction or interruption in supply, and an inability to develop alternative sources for such supply, could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in a timely or cost-effective manner, and our ability to make product sales.Many of our products are difficult to manufacture. This is due to the complex nature of manufacturing pharmaceuticals, including biologics, and devices, as well as the strict regulatory regime governing our manufacturing operations. Variations in the manufacturing process may result in production failures which could lead to launch delays, product shortage, unanticipated costs, lost revenues and damage to our reputation. A failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers may also result in a quality or safety issue of the type discussed above.8 Some of our products are manufactured at a single manufacturing facility or stored at a single storage site. Loss or damage to a manufacturing facility or storage site due to a natural disaster or otherwise could adversely affect our ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of key products or otherwise deliver products to meet customer demand or contractual requirements which may result in a loss of revenue and other adverse business consequences. Because of the time required to approve and license a manufacturing facility a third party manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis to replace production capacity in the event we lose manufacturing capacity or products are otherwise unavailable due to natural disaster, regulatory action or otherwise.If we are unable to protect our patents or other proprietary rights, or if we infringe the patents or other proprietary rights of others, our competitiveness and business prospects may be materially damaged.Patent and other proprietary rights are essential to our business. Our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain and enforce patents and licenses to patent rights, both in the United States and in other countries. We cannot guarantee that pending patent applications will result in issued patents, that patents issued or licensed will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, that our patents will not be found to be invalid or that the intellectual property rights of others will not prevent the company from selling certain products or including key features in the company’s products.The patent position of a healthcare company is often uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. Significant litigation concerning patents and products is pervasive in our industry. Patent claims include challenges to the coverage and validity of our patents on products or processes as well as allegations that our products infringe patents held by competitors or other third parties. A loss in any of these types of cases could result in a loss of patent protection or the ability to market products, which could lead to a significant loss of sales, or otherwise materially affect future results of operations. We also rely on trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and know-how to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive positions. Third parties may know, discover or independently develop equivalent proprietary information or techniques, or they may gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our trade secrets to the public.Although our employees, consultants, parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners are generally subject to confidentiality or similar agreements to protect our confidential and proprietary information, these agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. To the extent that our employees, consultants, parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.Furthermore, our intellectual property, other proprietary technology and other sensitive company data is potentially vulnerable to loss, damage or misappropriation from system malfunction, computer viruses, unauthorized access to our data or misappropriation or misuse thereof by those with permitted access and other events. While we have invested to protect our intellectual property and other data, and continue to work diligently in this area, there can be no assurance that our precautionary measures will prevent breakdowns, breaches, cyber incidents or other events. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.Misappropriation or other loss of our intellectual property from any of the foregoing would have an adverse effect on our competitive position and may cause us to incur substantial litigation costs.We are subject to risks associated with doing business globally.Our operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business globally and under the laws, regulations and customs of various jurisdictions and geographies. These risks include changes in exchange controls and other governmental actions, loss of business in government and public tenders that are held annually in many cases, increasingly complex labor environments, availability of raw materials, changes in taxation, export control restrictions, changes in or violations of U.S. or local laws, including the FCPA and the United Kingdom Bribery Act, dependence on a few government entities as customers, pricing restrictions, economic and political instability (including instability as it relates to the Euro and currencies in certain emerging market countries), disputes between countries, diminished or insufficient protection of intellectual property, and disruption or destruction of operations in a significant geographic region regardless of cause, including war, terrorism, riot, civil insurrection or social unrest. Failure to comply with, or material changes to, the laws and regulations that affect our global operations could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. The 2016 referendum by British voters to exit the European Union (EU) (commonly known as Brexit) has created uncertainties affecting business operations in the EU. The UK government is expected to initiate a process to withdraw from the EU in the coming months. A withdrawal could result in the deterioration of economic conditions, volatility in currency exchange rates (as evidenced by the deterioration in the value of the British pound as compared to the U.S. dollar following the Brexit vote), and increased regulatory complexities.  These outcomes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.9 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and liquidity.We generate the majority of our revenue and profit outside the United States. As a result, our financial results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or our ability to mitigate these risks. We may experience additional volatility as a result of inflationary pressures and other macroeconomic factors in certain emerging market countries. We are also exposed to changes in interest rates, and our ability to access the money markets and capital markets could be impeded if adverse liquidity market conditions occur. A discussion of the financial impact of foreign exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations, and the ways and extent to which we attempt to mitigate such impact is contained under the caption “Financial Instrument Market Risk” in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities may have a negative impact on our operating results.Tax policy reform continues to be a topic of discussion in the United States. Members of the newly installed U.S. Congress, including the Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, have identified comprehensive tax reform as a priority for 2017. A significant change to the tax system in the United States, including changes to the taxation of international income or imported product, could have an adverse effect upon our results of operations. Because we operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States, cross border transactions among our affiliates are a significant part of the manner in which we operate. Although we believe that we transact intercompany business in accordance with arms-length principles, taxing authorities may audit us from time to time, disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. However, we may not accurately predict the outcome of these audits, and as a result the actual outcome of these audits may have an adverse impact on our financial results. For more information on ongoing audits, see Note 15 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and subject to privacy and security laws, and our systems and infrastructure face certain risks, including from cyber security breaches and data leakage.We increasingly rely upon technology systems and infrastructure. Our technology systems are potentially vulnerable to breakdown or other interruption by fire, power loss, system malfunction, unauthorized access and other events. Likewise, data privacy breaches by employees and others with both permitted and unauthorized access to our systems and products may pose a risk that sensitive data (including protected health information (PHI)) may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public, or may be permanently lost. The increasing use and evolution of technology, including cloud-based computing, creates additional opportunities for the unintentional dissemination of information, intentional destruction of confidential information stored in our systems, products or in non-encrypted portable media or storage devices. We could also experience a business interruption, information theft of confidential information, or reputational damage from industrial espionage attacks, malware or other cyber incidents, which may compromise our system infrastructure or lead to data leakage, either internally or at our third-party providers or other business partners. As our products continue to evolve, third-parties may attempt to access or obtain proprietary information from our products or systems. Additionally, we must comply with numerous federal and state laws and regulations governing the collection, dissemination, access, use, security and PHI, including The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its implementing privacy and security regulations. While we have invested heavily in the protection of data and information technology and in related training, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent significant breakdowns, breaches in our systems or other cyber incidents or ensure compliance with all applicable security and privacy laws, regulations and standards, including with respect to third-party service providers that utilize sensitive personal information, including PHI, on our behalf. Any such breakdown, breach, incident or failure to comply could have a material adverse effect upon our reputation, business, operations or financial condition. In addition, significant implementation issues may arise as we continue to consolidate and outsource certain computer operations and application support activities.If we fail to attract and retain key employees our business may suffer.Our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees, including people in senior management, sales, marketing and research positions. Competition for top talent in healthcare can be intense. Our ability to recruit and retain such talent will depend on a number of factors, including hiring practices of our competitors, compensation and benefits, work location, work environment and industry economic conditions. If we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified employees, our business could suffer.We are subject to a number of pending lawsuits.We are a defendant in a number of pending lawsuits. In addition, we may be named as a defendant in future patent, product liability or other lawsuits. These current and future matters may result in a loss of patent protection, reduced revenue, significant liabilities and 10 diversion of our management’s time, attention and resources. Given the uncertain nature of litigation generally, we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in these current matters. In view of these uncertainties, the outcome of these matters may result in charges in excess of any established reserves, and, to the extent available, liability insurance. We also continue to be self-insured with respect to product liability claims. The absence of third-party insurance coverage for current or future claims increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims and adverse decisions. Protracted litigation, including any adverse outcomes, may have an adverse impact on the business, operations or financial condition of the company. Even claims without merit could subject us to adverse publicity and require us to incur significant legal fees. See Note 16 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding current lawsuits.Current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect our business and financial condition.The company’s ability to generate cash flows from operations could be affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the company’s products, in the solvency of its customers or suppliers, or deterioration in the company’s key financial ratios or credit ratings. Current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of our customers (including governments) to pay for our products and services, and the amount spent on healthcare generally. This could result in a decrease in the demand for our products and services, declining cash flows, longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. These conditions may also adversely affect certain of our suppliers, which could cause a disruption in our ability to produce our products. We continue to do business with foreign governments in certain countries, including Greece, Spain, Portugal, and Italy, which have experienced deterioration in credit and economic conditions. As of December 31, 2016, the company’s net accounts receivable from the public sector in Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy totaled $137 million. While global economic conditions have not significantly impacted the company’s ability to collect receivables, liquidity issues in certain countries have resulted, and may continue to result, in delays in the collection of receivables and credit losses. These conditions may also impact the stability of the Euro or Yuan. For more information on accounts receivable and credit matters with respect to certain of these countries, refer to the discussion under the caption entitled “Credit Facilities, Access to Capital and Credit Ratings” in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.We may incur operational difficulties or be exposed to claims and liabilities as a result of the separation and distribution.On July 1, 2015, we distributed approximately 80.5% of the outstanding shares of Baxalta common stock to Baxter stockholders in connection with the separation of our biopharmaceuticals business. We disposed of our remaining 19.5% stake in Baxalta (Retained Shares) in 2016, in connection with a series of transactions including debt-for-equity exchanges, an equity-for-equity exchange and a contribution to our U.S. pension plan (Retained Shares Transactions). Shire plc (Shire) acquired Baxalta in June 2016, after completion of the last Retained Shares Transaction. In connection with the July 2015 distribution, we entered into a separation and distribution agreement and various other agreements (including a transition services agreement, a tax matters agreement, a long term services agreement, a manufacturing and supply agreement, an employee matters agreement, a trademark license agreement, a Galaxy license agreement, an international commercial operations agreement, a shareholders’ and registration rights agreement and certain other commercial agreements) with Baxalta. These agreements govern the separation and distribution and the relationship between the companies going forward, including with respect to potential tax-related losses associated with the separation and distribution and the Retained Shares Transactions. They also provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time (including under the manufacturing and supply agreement pursuant to which Shire now manufactures and sells certain products and materials to us).The separation and distribution agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make Baxalta financially responsible for many liabilities that may exist relating to its business activities, whether incurred prior to or after the distribution, including any pending or future litigation. It is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between us and Baxalta and require us to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to Baxalta. Third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of these liabilities or obligations, and the indemnity rights we have under the separation and distribution agreement may not be sufficient to fully cover all of these liabilities and obligations. Even if we are successful in obtaining indemnification, we may have to bear costs temporarily. In addition, our indemnity obligations to Baxalta may be significant. These risks could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.The separation of Baxalta continues to involve a number of risks, including, among other things, the indemnification risks described above and the potential that management’s and our employees’ attention will be significantly diverted by the provision of transitional services. Certain of the agreements described above provide for the performance of services by each company for the benefit of the other for a period of time. Shire may elect to extend the term for which we provide services to Baxalta under these agreements. If Baxalta is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements, including its indemnification obligations, we could incur losses. These arrangements could also lead to disputes over rights to certain shared property and rights and over the allocation of costs and revenues for products and operations. Our inability to effectively manage the separation activities and related events could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.11 There could be significant liability if the separation and distribution or any Retained Shares Transaction is determined to be a taxable transaction. Baxalta has indemnified us for certain potential liabilities that may arise, and such indemnification obligation is guaranteed by Shire, but Baxalta and Shire may be unable to satisfy their indemnification obligations to us in the future.The separation and distribution and the Retained Shares Transactions (collectively, the Baxter Transactions) qualify for tax-free treatment to Baxter and its stockholders under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). Completion of the separation and distribution was conditioned upon, among other things, the receipt of a private letter ruling from the IRS regarding certain issues relating to the tax-free treatment of the Baxter Transactions. Although the IRS private letter ruling is generally binding on the IRS, the continuing validity of such ruling is subject to the accuracy of factual representations and assumptions made in the ruling. Completion of the distribution was also conditioned upon Baxter’s receipt of a tax opinion from KPMG LLP regarding certain aspects of the Baxalta spin-off not covered by the IRS private letter ruling. The opinion was based upon various factual representations and assumptions, as well as certain undertakings made by Baxter and Baxalta. If any of the factual representations or assumptions in the IRS private letter ruling or tax opinion is untrue or incomplete in any material respect, if any undertaking is not complied with, or if the facts upon which the IRS private letter ruling or tax opinion are based are materially different from the actual facts relating to the Baxter Transactions, the opinion or IRS private letter ruling may not be valid. Moreover, opinions of a tax advisor are not binding on the IRS. As a result, the conclusions expressed in the opinion of a tax advisor could be successfully challenged by the IRS.If the Baxter Transactions are determined to be taxable, Baxter and its stockholders could incur significant tax liabilities. Pursuant to the tax matters agreement, Baxalta agreed to indemnify us for certain tax-related losses incurred if Baxalta’s actions cause the separation and distribution and certain related transactions to fail to qualify for tax-free status under the applicable provisions of the Code.In anticipation of the proposed Baxalta — Shire merger (the Merger), we entered into a letter agreement with Shire and Baxalta (the Letter Agreement). Under the Letter Agreement, Baxalta agreed to indemnify, and Shire agreed to guarantee such indemnity to, Baxter and each of its affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors and employees against certain tax-related losses attributable to or resulting from (in whole or in part) the merger as further described in the Letter Agreement. If the Baxter Transactions are determined to be taxable as a result (in whole or in part) of the merger (for example, if the merger is deemed to be part of a plan (or series of related transactions) that includes the Baxter Transactions), Baxter and its stockholders could incur significant tax liabilities. Although Baxalta and Shire may be required to indemnify Baxter under the tax matters agreement and the Letter Agreement for any such tax liabilities incurred by Baxter, there can be no assurance that the indemnity from Baxalta or the guarantee thereof by Shire will be sufficient to protect us against all or a part of the amount of such liabilities, or that either Baxalta or Shire will be able to fully satisfy their respective obligations.Even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Baxalta or Shire any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these costs ourselves, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.  "
3,BAX,BAXTER INTERNATIONAL INC,2016-02-26,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
.  Inaddition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, stockholders or prospective investors should carefully consider the following risk factors. If any of the events described below occurs, our business, financial condition andresults of operations and future growth prospects could suffer.  Risks Related to Baxters Business We may not achieve our long-term financial improvement goals.  In connection with the separation and distribution, we announced plans to enhance profitability and returns for our stockholders. These plans include the achievement of certain financial goals (includingimproved operating margin) in 2016 and beyond. While we are continuing to refine these goals, our plan contemplates significant margin expansion over our long-range plan, which covers the time period from 2015 through 2020. We have identifiedcertain key strategies to help achieve these targets. These strategies include optimizing our core product portfolio globally, driving operational excellence through the rebasing of our cost structure and maximizing the value derived from theallocation of our capital.  As part of these strategies, we continue to evaluate the performance of all of our businesses and may sell oracquire a business or product line or exit a particular market. We are also evaluating our corporate and commercial infrastructure in the interest of streamlining costs while maintaining our commitment to quality and safety. Future divestitures mayresult in significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets. Future acquisitions may fail to achieve the desired financial results (including return on investment) and synergies and may not provide the desiredmarket access. The restructuring of our operations may not generate targeted savings or may cause unexpected disruptions to our business. As a result, we may not achieve our targeted financial results, which could have a material adverse effect onour business, financial condition or results of operations.  If we are unable to successfully introduce new products or fail to keeppace with advances in technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.  We need tosuccessfully introduce new products to achieve our strategic business objectives. Product development requires substantial investment and there is inherent risk in the research and development process. A successful product development processdepends on many factors, including our ability to properly anticipate and satisfy customer needs, adapt to new technologies, obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis, demonstrate satisfactory clinical results, manufacture products in aneconomical and timely manner and differentiate our products from those of our competitors. If we cannot successfully introduce new products or adapt to changing technologies, our products may become obsolete and our revenue and profitability couldsuffer.   6 Table of ContentsIssues with product supply or quality could have an adverse effect upon our business, subject us toregulatory actions and cause a loss of customer confidence in us or our products.  Our success depends upon the availability andquality of our products. The medical products industry is competitive and subject to complex market dynamics and varying demand levels. These levels vary in response to macro-economic conditions, regulatory requirements (including the availabilityof private or public reimbursement) and seasonality. Additionally the development of new or enhanced products involves a lengthy regulatory process and is capital intensive. As a result, our ability to match our production levels and capacity tomarket demand is imprecise and may result in a failure to meet market demand or satisfy customer requirements for our products or, alternatively, an oversupply of inventory. Failure to meet market demand may result in customers transitioning toavailable competitive products resulting in a loss of market share or customer confidence. In the event of an oversupply, we may be forced to lower our prices or record asset impairment charges or take other action which may adversely affect ourbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.  Additionally, quality management plays an essential role in determining and meetingcustomer requirements, preventing defects, improving the companys products and services and assuring the safety and efficacy of our products. Our future success depends on our ability to maintain and continuously improve our quality managementprogram. While we have one quality system deployed globally that covers the lifecycle of our products, quality and safety issues may occur with respect to any of our products. A quality or safety issue may result in adverse inspection reports,warning letters, product recalls (either voluntary or required by the FDA or similar governmental authorities in other countries) or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminalsanctions, costly litigation, refusal of a government to grant approvals and licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. An inability to address a quality or safety issue in an effective and timely mannermay also cause negative publicity, a loss of customer confidence in us or our current or future products, which may result in the loss of sales and difficulty in successfully launching new products. Additionally, Baxter has made and continues tomake significant investments in assets, including inventory and property, plant and equipment, which relate to potential new products or modifications to existing products. Product quality or safety issues may restrict the company from being able torealize the expected returns from these investments, potentially resulting in asset impairments in the future.  Unaffiliated third partysuppliers provide a number of goods and services to our R&D, clinical and manufacturing organizations. Third party suppliers are required to comply with our quality standards. Failure of a third party supplier to provide compliant raw materialsor supplies could result in delays, service interruptions or other quality related issues that may negatively impact our business results. In addition, some of the raw materials employed in our production processes are derived from human and animalorigins, requiring robust controls to eliminate the potential for introduction of pathogenic agents or other contaminants.  For moreinformation on regulatory matters currently affecting us, refer to the discussion under the caption entitled Certain Regulatory Matters in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We are subject to a number of existing laws and regulations, non-compliance with which could adversely affect our business, financial condition andresults of operations, and we are susceptible to a changing regulatory environment.  As a participant in the healthcare industry, ouroperations and products, and those of our customers, are regulated by numerous government agencies, both inside and outside the United States. The impact of this on us is direct to the extent we are subject to these laws and regulations, andindirect in that in a number of situations, even though we may not be directly regulated by specific healthcare laws and regulations, our products must be capable of being used by our customers in a manner that complies with those laws andregulations.   7 Table of ContentsThe manufacture, distribution, marketing and use of our products are subject to extensive regulation andscrutiny by FDA and other regulatory authorities globally. Any new product must undergo lengthy and rigorous testing and other extensive, costly and time-consuming procedures mandated by FDA and foreign regulatory authorities. Changes to currentproducts may be subject to vigorous review, including additional 510(k) and other regulatory submissions, and approvals are not certain. Our facilities must be approved and licensed prior to production and remain subject to inspection from time totime thereafter. Failure to comply with the requirements of FDA or other regulatory authorities, including a failed inspection or a failure in our adverse event reporting system, could result in adverse inspection reports, warning letters, productrecalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt the manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a government to grant approvals or licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existingapprovals and licenses. Any of these actions could cause a loss of customer confidence in us and our products, which could adversely affect our sales. The requirements of regulatory authorities, including interpretative guidance, are subject tochange and compliance with additional or changing requirements or interpretative guidance may subject the company to further review, result in product launch delays or otherwise increase our costs. For information on current regulatory issuesaffecting us, please refer to the caption entitled Certain Regulatory Matters in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In connection with these issues, there can be no assurance that additional costs or civil and criminalpenalties will not be incurred, that additional regulatory actions with respect to the company will not occur, that the company will not face civil claims for damages from purchasers or users, that substantial additional charges or significant assetimpairments may not be required, that sales of other products may not be adversely affected, or that additional regulation will not be introduced that may adversely affect the companys operations and consolidated financial statements. The sales, marketing and pricing of products and relationships that pharmaceutical and medical device companies have with healthcareproviders are under increased scrutiny by federal, state and foreign government agencies. Compliance with the Anti-Kickback Statute, False Claims Act, Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (including as these laws relate to off-label promotion of products)and other healthcare related laws, as well as competition, data and patient privacy and export and import laws, is under increased focus by the agencies charged with overseeing such activities, including FDA, OIG, DOJ and the Federal TradeCommission. The DOJ and the Securities and Exchange Commission have also increased their focus on the enforcement of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), particularly as it relates to the conduct of pharmaceutical companies. The FCPA andsimilar anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their employees, contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Healthcare professionals in many countriesare employed by the government and consequently may be considered government officials. Foreign governments have also increased their scrutiny of pharmaceutical and medical device companies sales and marketing activities and relationships withhealthcare providers and competitive practices generally. The laws and standards governing the promotion, sale and reimbursement of our products and those governing our relationships with healthcare providers and governments, including the SunshineAct enacted under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, can be complicated, are subject to frequent change and may be violated unknowingly. We have compliance programs in place, including policies, training and various forms of monitoring,designed to address these risks. Nonetheless, these programs and policies may not always protect us from conduct by individual employees that violate these laws. Violations or allegations of violations of these laws may result in large civil andcriminal penalties, debarment from participating in government programs, diversion of management time, attention and resources and may otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For moreinformation related to the companys ongoing government investigations, please refer to Note 16 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The laws and regulations discussed above are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial cost associated with compliance or to alter one or more ofour sales and marketing practices and may subject us to enforcement actions which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.   8 Table of ContentsIf reimbursement or other payment for our current or future products is reduced or modified in theUnited States or abroad, including through the implementation of government-sponsored healthcare reform or other similar actions, cost containment measures, or changes to policies with respect to pricing, taxation or rebates, then our business couldsuffer.  Sales of our products depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our products are paid by both public and privatepayors. These payors include Medicare, Medicaid, and private health care insurers in the United States and foreign governments and third-party payors outside the United States. Public and private payors are increasingly challenging the pricescharged for medical products and services. We may continue to experience continued downward pricing pressures from any or all of these payors which could result in an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operational results. Global efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing. Governments around the world use variousmechanisms to control healthcare expenditures such as price controls, the formation of public contracting authorities, product formularies (lists of recommended or approved products), and competitive tenders which require the submission of a bid tosell products. Sales of our products are dependent, in part, on the availability of reimbursement by government agencies and healthcare programs, as well as insurance companies and other private payors. In much of Europe, Latin America, Asia andAustralia, for example, the government provides healthcare at low cost to patients, and controls its expenditures by purchasing products through public tenders, collective purchasing, regulating prices, setting reference prices in public tenders orlimiting reimbursement or patient access to certain products. Additionally, austerity measures or other reforms by foreign governments may limit, reduce or eliminate payments for our products and adversely affect both pricing flexibility and demandfor our products.  For example, in the United States the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), which was signed into law inMarch 2010, includes several provisions which impact our businesses in the United States, including increased Medicaid rebates and an expansion of the 340B Drug Pricing Program which provides certain qualified entities, such as hospitals servingdisadvantaged populations, with discounts on the purchase of drugs for outpatient use and an excise tax on the sale of certain drugs. We may also experience downward pricing pressure as the PPACA reduces Medicare and Medicaid payments to hospitalsand other providers. While it is intended to expand health insurance coverage and increase access to medical care generally, the long-term impact of the PPACA on our business and the demand for our products is uncertain. As a result of these and other measures, including future measures or reforms that cannot be predicted, reimbursement may not be available or sufficientto allow us to sell our products on a competitive basis. Legislation and regulations affecting reimbursement for our products may change at any time and in ways that may be adverse to us. We cannot predict the impact of these pressures andinitiatives, or any negative effects of any additional regulations that may affect our business.  There is substantial competition inthe product markets in which we operate.  Although no single company competes with us in all of our businesses, we face substantialcompetition in both of our segments from international and domestic healthcare and pharmaceutical companies and providers of all sizes. Competition is primarily focused on cost-effectiveness, price, service, product performance, and technologicalinnovation.  Competition may increase further as additional companies begin to enter our markets or modify their existing products to competedirectly with ours. If our competitors respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or we do not introduce new versions or upgrades to our product portfolio in response to those requirements, our productsmay be rendered obsolete or non-competitive. If our competitors develop more effective or affordable products, or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than we do, our operations will likely be negatively affected. If we areforced to reduce our prices due to   9 Table of Contentsincreased competition, our business could become less profitable. The companys sales could be adversely affected if any of its contracts with GPOs, IDNs or other customers are terminateddue to increased competition or otherwise.  If our business development activities are unsuccessful, our business could suffer and ourfinancial performance could be adversely affected.  As part of our long-term strategy, we are engaged in business developmentactivities including evaluating acquisitions, joint development opportunities, technology licensing arrangements and other opportunities. These activities may result in substantial investment of the companys resources. Our success developingproducts or expanding into new markets from such activities will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to find suitable opportunities for acquisition, investment or alliance; whether we are able to complete an acquisition, investmentor alliance on terms that are satisfactory to us; the strength of the other companys underlying technology, products and ability to execute its business strategies; any intellectual property and litigation related to these products ortechnology; and our ability to successfully integrate the acquired company, business, product, technology or research into our existing operations, including the ability to adequately fund acquired in-process research and development projects and tomaintain adequate controls over the combined operations. Certain of these activities are subject to antitrust and competition laws, which laws could impact our ability to pursue strategic transactions and could result in mandated divestitures in thecontext of proposed acquisitions. If we are unsuccessful in our business development activities, we may be unable to meet our financial targets and our financial performance could be adversely affected. For more information on recent business development activities, see Note 5 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If we are unable to obtain sufficient components or raw materials on a timely basis or if we experience other manufacturing or supply difficulties,our business may be adversely affected.  The manufacture of our products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of qualitycomponents and materials. We manufacture our products in approximately 50 manufacturing facilities around the world. We acquire our components and materials from many suppliers in various countries. We work closely with our suppliers to ensure thecontinuity of supply but we cannot guarantee these efforts will always be successful. Further, while efforts are made to diversify our sources of components and materials, in certain instances we acquire components and materials from a solesupplier. For most of our components and materials for which a sole supplier is used, we believe that alternative sources of supply exist and have made a strategic determination to use a sole supplier. In very limited instances, however, we do relyupon sole supplier relationships for which no alternatives have currently been identified. Although we do carry strategic inventory and maintain insurance to mitigate the potential risk related to any related supply disruption, there can be noassurance that such measures will be effective. Due to the regulatory environment in which we operate, we may be unable to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for some components or materials. A reduction or interruption in supply,and an inability to develop alternative sources for such supply, could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in a timely or cost-effective manner, and our ability to make product sales. Many of our products are difficult to manufacture. This is due to the complex nature of manufacturing pharmaceuticals, including biologics, and devices,as well as the strict regulatory regime governing our manufacturing operations. Variations in the manufacturing process may result in production failures which could lead to launch delays, product shortage, unanticipated costs, lost revenues anddamage to our reputation. A failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers may also result in a quality or safety issue of the type discussed above. Several of our products are manufactured at a single manufacturing facility or stored at a single storage site. Loss or damage to a manufacturingfacility or storage site due to a natural disaster or otherwise could adversely affect   10 Table of Contentsour ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of key products or otherwise deliver products to meet customer demand or contractual requirements which may result in a loss of revenue and otheradverse business consequences. Because of the time required to approve and license a manufacturing facility a third party manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis to replace production capacity in the event we lose manufacturing capacityor products are otherwise unavailable due to natural disaster, regulatory action or otherwise.  If we are unable to protect our patentsor other proprietary rights, or if we infringe the patents or other proprietary rights of others, our competitiveness and business prospects may be materially damaged.  Patent and other proprietary rights are essential to our business. Our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain and enforce patents and licenses to patent rights, both in theUnited States and in other countries. We cannot guarantee that pending patent applications will result in issued patents, that patents issued or licensed will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, that our patents will not be found to beinvalid or that the intellectual property rights of others will not prevent the company from selling certain products or including key features in the companys products.  The patent position of a healthcare company is often uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. Significant litigation concerning patents and products is pervasive in our industry. Patentclaims include challenges to the coverage and validity of our patents on products or processes as well as allegations that our products infringe patents held by competitors or other third parties. A loss in any of these types of cases could resultin a loss of patent protection or the ability to market products, which could lead to a significant loss of sales, or otherwise materially affect future results of operations. We also rely on trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and know-how todevelop, maintain and strengthen our competitive positions. Third parties may know, discover or independently develop equivalent proprietary information or techniques, or they may gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our trade secrets to thepublic.  Although our employees, consultants, parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners are generally subject toconfidentiality or similar agreements to protect our confidential and proprietary information, these agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. To the extent that our employees, consultants, parties tocollaboration agreements and other business partners use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. Furthermore, our intellectual property, other proprietary technology and other sensitive company data is potentially vulnerable to loss, damage ormisappropriation from system malfunction, computer viruses, unauthorized access to our data or misappropriation or misuse thereof by those with permitted access and other events. While we have invested to protect our intellectual property and otherdata, and continue to work diligently in this area, there can be no assurance that our precautionary measures will prevent breakdowns, breaches, cyber incidents or other events. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation,business, financial condition or results of operations.  Misappropriation or other loss of our intellectual property from any of the foregoingwould have an adverse effect on our competitive position and may cause us to incur substantial litigation costs.  We are subject torisks associated with doing business globally.  Our operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business globally and underthe laws, regulations and customs of various jurisdictions and geographies. These risks include changes in exchange controls and other governmental actions, loss of business in government and public tenders that are held annually in many cases,increasingly complex labor environments, availability of raw materials, changes in taxation, export control restrictions, changes in or violations of U.S. or local laws, including the FCPA and the United Kingdom Bribery  11 Table of ContentsAct, dependence on a few government entities as customers, pricing restrictions, economic and political instability (including instability as it relates to the Euro and currencies in certainemerging market countries), disputes between countries, diminished or insufficient protection of intellectual property, and disruption or destruction of operations in a significant geographic region regardless of cause, including war, terrorism,riot, civil insurrection or social unrest. Failure to comply with, or material changes to, the laws and regulations that affect our global operations could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our operating results andliquidity.  We generate the majority of our revenue and profit outside the United States. As a result, our financial results may beadversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or our ability to mitigate these risks. We may experience additional volatility as a result ofinflationary pressures and other macroeconomic factors in certain emerging market countries. We are also exposed to changes in interest rates, and our ability to access the money markets and capital markets could be impeded if adverse liquiditymarket conditions occur. A discussion of the financial impact of foreign exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations, and the ways and extent to which we attempt to mitigate such impact is contained under the caption Financial InstrumentMarket Risk in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income taxliabilities may have a negative impact on our operating results.  Tax policy reform continues to be a topic of discussion in the UnitedStates. A significant change to the tax system in the United States, including changes to the taxation of international income, could have an adverse effect upon our results of operations. Because we operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions bothinside and outside the United States, we are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits inorder to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. However, we may not accurately predict the outcome of these audits, and as a result the actual outcome of these audits may have an adverse impact on our financial results. For moreinformation on ongoing audits, see Note 15 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  We are increasingly dependent oninformation technology systems and subject to privacy and security laws, and our systems and infrastructure face certain risks, including from cyber security breaches and data leakage.  We increasingly rely upon technology systems and infrastructure. Our technology systems are potentially vulnerable to breakdown or other interruption by fire, power loss, system malfunction, unauthorizedaccess and other events. Likewise, data privacy breaches by employees and others with both permitted and unauthorized access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data (including protected health information (PHI)) may be exposed tounauthorized persons or to the public, or may be permanently lost. The increasing use and evolution of technology, including cloud-based computing, creates additional opportunities for the unintentional dissemination of information, intentionaldestruction of confidential information stored in our systems or in non-encrypted portable media or storage devices. We could also experience a business interruption, information theft of confidential information, or reputational damage fromindustrial espionage attacks, malware or other cyber incidents, which may compromise our system infrastructure or lead to data leakage, either internally or at our third-party providers or other business partners. Additionally, we must comply withnumerous federal and state laws and regulations governing the collection, dissemination, access, use, security and PHI, including The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and its implementing privacy and security regulations.While we have invested heavily in the protection of data and information technology and in related training, there   12 Table of Contentscan be no assurance that our efforts will prevent significant breakdowns, breaches in our systems or other cyber incidents or ensure compliance with all applicable security and privacy laws,regulations and standards, including with respect to third-party service providers that utilize sensitive personal information, including PHI, on our behalf. Any such breakdown, breach, incident or failure to comply could have a material adverseeffect upon our reputation, business, operations or financial condition. In addition, significant implementation issues may arise as we continue to consolidate and outsource certain computer operations and application support activities. If we fail to attract and retain key employees our business may suffer.  Our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees, including people in senior management, sales, marketing and research positions. Competition for top talent inhealthcare can be intense. Our ability to recruit and retain such talent will depend on a number of factors, including hiring practices of our competitors, compensation and benefits, work location, work environment and industry economic conditions.If we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified employees, our business could suffer.  We are subject to a number of pendinglawsuits.  We are a defendant in a number of pending lawsuits. In addition, we may be named as a defendant in future patent, productliability or other lawsuits. These current and future matters may result in a loss of patent protection, reduced revenue, significant liabilities and diversion of our managements time, attention and resources. Given the uncertain nature oflitigation generally, we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in these current matters. In view of these uncertainties, the outcome of these matters may result in charges inexcess of any established reserves, and, to the extent available, liability insurance. We also continue to be self-insured with respect to product liability claims. The absence of third-party insurance coverage for current or future claims increasesour potential exposure to unanticipated claims and adverse decisions. Protracted litigation, including any adverse outcomes, may have an adverse impact on the business, operations or financial condition of the company. Even claims without meritcould subject us to adverse publicity and require us to incur significant legal fees. See Note 16 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding current lawsuits. Current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect our business and financial condition. The companys ability to generate cash flows from operations could be affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the companysproducts, in the solvency of its customers or suppliers, or deterioration in the companys key financial ratios or credit ratings. Current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of our customers (includinggovernments) to pay for our products and services, and the amount spent on healthcare generally. This could result in a decrease in the demand for our products and services, declining cash flows, longer sales cycles, slower adoption of newtechnologies and increased price competition. These conditions may also adversely affect certain of our suppliers, which could cause a disruption in our ability to produce our products. We continue to do business with foreign governments in certaincountries, including Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy, which have experienced deterioration in credit and economic conditions. As of December 31, 2015, the companys net accounts receivable from the public sector in Greece, Spain,Portugal and Italy totaled $211 million. While global economic conditions have not significantly impacted the companys ability to collect receivables, liquidity issues in certain countries have resulted, and may continue to result, in delaysin the collection of receivables and credit losses. These conditions may also impact the stability of the Euro or Yuan. For more information on accounts receivable and credit matters with respect to certain of these countries, refer to thediscussion under the caption entitled Credit Facilities, Access to Capital and Credit Ratings in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  We may incur operational difficulties or be exposed to claims and liabilities as a result of the separation and distribution.  On July 1, 2015, we distributed approximately 80.5% of the outstanding shares of Baxalta common stock to Baxter stockholders in connection with the separation of our biopharmaceuticals business.After giving effect to the   13 Table of Contentsdistribution we retained approximately 19.5% of the outstanding Baxalta shares (the Retained Shares). In connection with the distribution, we entered into a separation and distribution agreementand various other agreements (including a transition services agreement, a tax matters agreement, a long term services agreement, a manufacturing and supply agreement, an employee matters agreement, a trademark license agreement, a Galaxy licenseagreement, an international commercial operations agreement, a shareholders and registration rights agreement and certain other commercial agreements). These agreements govern the separation and distribution and the relationship between thetwo companies going forward, including with respect to potential tax-related losses associated with the separation and distribution and certain dispositions of the Retained Shares. They also provide for the performance of services by each companyfor the benefit of the other for a period of time (including under the manufacturing and supply agreement pursuant to which Baxalta manufactures and sells certain products and materials to us). In connection with Baxaltas entry into a merger agreement with Shire plc (Shire) on January 11, 2016, we entered into a letter agreement withShire and Baxalta (the Letter Agreement). The Letter Agreement, as further described below, addresses certain matters related to the tax matters agreement and provides us with enhanced transaction support with respect to certain debt-for-equityand/or equity-for-equity exchanges involving the Retained Shares (the Retained Shares Transactions). See  There could be significant liability if the separation and distribution or any Later Distribution is determined to be ataxable transaction. Baxalta has indemnified us for certain potential liabilities that may arise, and such indemnification obligation is guaranteed by Shire with respect to the proposed combination of Baxalta and Shire, but Baxalta and Shire may beunable to satisfy their indemnification obligations to us in the future for a more detailed discussion of the Letter Agreement.  Theseparation and distribution agreement provides for indemnification obligations designed to make Baxalta financially responsible for many liabilities that may exist relating to its business activities, whether incurred prior to or after thedistribution, including any pending or future litigation. It is possible that a court would disregard the allocation agreed to between us and Baxalta and require us to assume responsibility for obligations allocated to Baxalta. Third parties couldalso seek to hold us responsible for any of these liabilities or obligations, and the indemnity rights we have under the separation and distribution agreement may not be sufficient to fully cover all of these liabilities and obligations. Even if weare successful in obtaining indemnification, we may have to bear costs temporarily. In addition, our indemnity obligations to Baxalta may be significant. These risks could negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. The separation of Baxalta continues to involve a number of risks, including, among other things, the indemnification risks described aboveand the potential that managements and our employees attention will be significantly diverted by the provision of transitional services. Certain of the agreements described above provide for the performance of services by each companyfor the benefit of the other for a period of time. If Baxalta is unable to satisfy its obligations under these agreements, including its indemnification obligations, we could incur losses. These arrangements could also lead to disputes over rightsto certain shared property and rights and over the allocation of costs and revenues for products and operations. Our inability to effectively manage the separation activities and related events could adversely affect our business, financialcondition or results of operations.  We may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits of the separation and distribution, andsuch events may adversely affect our business.  We may not be able to achieve the full strategic and financial benefits expected toresult from the separation and distribution, or such benefits may be delayed or not occur at all. Although the separation of Baxalta is expected to provide a number of benefits, including, among others, enabling management to better focus on ourmedical products business, providing the ability to more effectively commercialize new and existing product offerings, drive innovation across our Hospital Products and Renal businesses and allocate necessary resources to the areas presenting thehighest growth potential and providing flexibility to pursue growth and investment strategies that could result in revenue acceleration, improved profitability and enhanced returns, if we fail to achieve some or all  14 Table of Contentsof the expected benefits of the separation, or if such benefits are delayed, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected and the value of our stockcould be adversely impacted. See Risks Associated with Our Business  We may not achieve our long-term financial improvement goals for additional information on risks associated with our post-separationstrategies.  We may not be able to capture the full benefits from our retained stake in Baxalta. As of January 31, 2016, we owned approximately 94.3 million Baxalta shares after giving effect to a Retained Shares Transaction,as described above. As with any investment in a publicly traded company, this investment is subject to risks and uncertainties relating to Baxaltas business, some of which are disclosed in Baxaltas filings with the SEC (including withrespect to the proposed combination of Baxalta and Shire) and risks and uncertainties relating to fluctuations in public equity markets generally.  In addition, under the shareholders and registration rights agreement, we committed to vote all of the Retained Shares in proportion to the votes cast by Baxaltas other stockholders. Althoughwe have entered into the Letter Agreement, such commitment could adversely impact our ability to exert influence (that we may otherwise have) over Baxalta to act in a manner that we may believe best for protecting or enhancing the value of ourinvestment.  Additionally, any disposition of the Retained Shares by us in the public market, or the perception that such dispositions couldoccur, could adversely affect prevailing market prices for Baxalta shares and thereby adversely affect the value of the Retained Shares disposed of by us in any Retained Shares Transaction or adversely affect the terms and conditions of suchdisposition.  There could be significant liability if the separation and distribution or subsequent distribution of Retained Shares isdetermined to be a taxable transaction. Baxalta has indemnified us for certain potential liabilities that may arise, and such indemnification obligation is guaranteed by Shire with respect to the proposed combination of Baxalta and Shire, butBaxalta and Shire may be unable to satisfy their indemnification obligations to us in the future.  The separation anddistribution, the Retained Shares Transactions and certain other uses of the Retained Shares, including a contribution to our U.S. qualified pension plan or dividend to our stockholders (collectively, the Baxter Transactions), are intended toqualify for tax-free treatment to Baxter and its stockholders under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). Completion of the separation and distribution was conditioned upon, among other things, the receipt of a private letterruling from the IRS regarding certain issues relating to the tax-free treatment of the Baxter Transactions. Although the IRS private letter ruling is generally binding on the IRS, the continuing validity of such ruling is subject to the accuracy offactual representations and assumptions made in the ruling. Completion of the distribution was also conditioned upon Baxters receipt of a tax opinion from KPMG LLP regarding certain aspects of the Baxalta spin-off not covered by the IRSprivate letter ruling. The opinion was based upon various factual representations and assumptions, as well as certain undertakings made by Baxter and Baxalta. If any of the factual representations or assumptions in the IRS private letter ruling ortax opinion is untrue or incomplete in any material respect, if any undertaking is not complied with, or if the facts upon which the IRS private letter ruling or tax opinion are based are materially different from the actual facts relating to theBaxter Transactions, the opinion or IRS private letter ruling may not be valid. Moreover, opinions of a tax advisor are not binding on the IRS. As a result, the conclusions expressed in the opinion of a tax advisor could be successfully challengedby the IRS.  If the Baxter Transactions are determined to be taxable, Baxter and its stockholders could incur significant tax liabilities.Pursuant to the tax matters agreement, Baxalta agreed to indemnify us for certain tax-related losses incurred if Baxaltas actions cause the separation and distribution and certain related transactions to fail to qualify for tax-free statusunder the applicable provisions of the Code.  In connection with the proposed Baxalta  Shire merger, we entered into theLetter Agreement with Shire and Baxalta (as described above). Under the Letter Agreement, from and after the closing of the merger, Baxalta   15 Table of Contentsagreed to indemnify, and Shire agreed to guarantee such indemnity to, Baxter and each of its affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors and employees against certain tax-relatedlosses attributable to or resulting from (in whole or in part) the merger as further described in the Letter Agreement. If the Baxter Transactions are determined to be taxable as a result (in whole or in part) of the merger (for example, if themerger is deemed to be part of a plan (or series of related transactions) that includes the Baxter Transactions), Baxter and its stockholders could incur significant tax liabilities. Although Baxalta and Shire may be required to indemnify Baxterunder the tax matters agreement and the Letter Agreement for any such tax liabilities incurred by Baxter, there can be no assurance that the indemnity from Baxalta or the guarantee thereof by Shire will be sufficient to protect us against all or apart of the amount of such liabilities, or that either Baxalta or Shire will be able to fully satisfy their respective obligations.  Even ifwe ultimately succeed in recovering from Baxalta or Shire any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these costs ourselves, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financialcondition.   "

.  In additionto the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, shareholders or prospective investors should carefully consider the following risk factors. If any of the events described below occurs, our business, financial condition and resultsof operations and future growth prospects could suffer.  If we are unable to successfully introduce new products or fail to keep pacewith advances in technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.  We need tosuccessfully introduce new products to achieve our strategic business objectives. Product development requires substantial investment and there is inherent risk in the research and development process. A successful product development processdepends on many factors, including our ability to properly anticipate and satisfy customer needs, adapt to new technologies, obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis, demonstrate satisfactory clinical results, manufacture products in aneconomical and timely manner and differentiate our products from those of our competitors. If we cannot successfully introduce new products or adapt to changing technologies, our products may become obsolete and our revenue and profitability couldsuffer.  Issues with product quality could have an adverse effect upon our business, subject us to regulatory actions and cause a lossof customer confidence in us or our products.  Our success depends upon the quality of our products. Quality management plays anessential role in determining and meeting customer requirements, preventing defects, improving the companys products and services and assuring the safety and efficacy of our products. Our future success depends on our ability to maintain andcontinuously improve our quality management program. While we have one quality system deployed globally that covers the lifecycle of our products, quality and safety issues may occur with respect to any of our products. A quality or safety issue mayresult in adverse inspection reports, warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, costly litigation, refusal of a government to grantapprovals and licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. An inability to address a quality or safety issue in an effective and timely manner may also cause negative publicity, a loss of customer confidencein us or our current or future products, which may result in the loss of sales and difficulty in successfully launching new products. Additionally, Baxter has made and continues to make significant investments in assets, including inventory andproperty, plant and equipment, which relate to potential new products or modifications to existing products. Product quality or safety issues may restrict the company from being able to realize the expected returns from these investments,potentially resulting in asset impairments in the future.  Unaffiliated third party suppliers provide a number of goods and services to ourR&D, clinical and manufacturing organizations. Third party suppliers are required to comply with our quality standards. Failure of a third party supplier to provide compliant raw materials or supplies could result in delays, serviceinterruptions or   6 Table of Contentsother quality related issues that may negatively impact our business results. In addition, some of the raw materials employed in our production processes are derived from human and animalorigins, requiring robust controls to eliminate the potential for introduction of pathogenic agents or other contaminants.  For moreinformation on regulatory matters currently affecting us, refer to the discussion under the caption entitled Certain Regulatory Matters in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We are subject to a number of existing laws and regulations, non-compliance with which could adversely affect our business, financial condition andresults of operations, and we are susceptible to a changing regulatory environment.  As a participant in the healthcare industry, ouroperations and products, and those of our customers, are regulated by numerous government agencies, both inside and outside the United States. The impact of this on us is direct to the extent we are subject to these laws and regulations, andindirect in that in a number of situations, even though we may not be directly regulated by specific healthcare laws and regulations, our products must be capable of being used by our customers in a manner that complies with those laws andregulations.  The manufacture, distribution, marketing and use of our products are subject to extensive regulation and scrutiny by FDA andother regulatory authorities globally. Any new product must undergo lengthy and rigorous testing and other extensive, costly and time-consuming procedures mandated by FDA and foreign regulatory authorities. Changes to current products may be subjectto vigorous review, including additional 510(k) and other regulatory submissions, and approvals are not certain. Our facilities must be approved and licensed prior to production and remain subject to inspection from time to time thereafter. Failureto comply with the requirements of FDA or other regulatory authorities, including a failed inspection or a failure in our adverse event reporting system, could result in adverse inspection reports, warning letters, product recalls or seizures,monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt the manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a government to grant approvals or licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses.Any of these actions could cause a loss of customer confidence in us and our products, which could adversely affect our sales. The requirements of regulatory authorities, including interpretative guidance, are subject to change and compliance withadditional or changing requirements or interpretative guidance may subject the company to further review, result in product launch delays or otherwise increase our costs. For information on current regulatory issues affecting us, please refer to thecaption entitled Certain Regulatory Matters in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In connection with these issues, there can be no assurance that additional costs or civil and criminal penalties will not be incurred,that additional regulatory actions with respect to the company will not occur, that the company will not face civil claims for damages from purchasers or users, that substantial additional charges or significant asset impairments may not berequired, that sales of other products may not be adversely affected, or that additional regulation will not be introduced that may adversely affect the companys operations and consolidated financial statements. The sales, marketing and pricing of products and relationships that pharmaceutical and medical device companies have with healthcare providers are underincreased scrutiny by federal, state and foreign government agencies. Compliance with the Anti-Kickback Statute, False Claims Act, Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (including as these laws relate to off-label promotion of products) and other healthcarerelated laws, as well as competition, data and patient privacy and export and import laws, is under increased focus by the agencies charged with overseeing such activities, including FDA, OIG, DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission. The DOJ and theSecurities and Exchange Commission have also increased their focus on the enforcement of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), particularly as it relates to the conduct of pharmaceutical companies. The FCPA and similar anti-briberylaws generally prohibit companies and their employees, contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Healthcare professionals in many countries are employed by thegovernment and consequently may be considered government officials. Foreign governments have also increased their scrutiny of pharmaceutical and medical device companies sales and marketing activities and relationships with healthcareproviders and   7 Table of Contentscompetitive practices generally. The laws and standards governing the promotion, sale and reimbursement of our products and those governing our relationships with healthcare providers andgovernments, including the Sunshine Act enacted under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, can be complicated, are subject to frequent change and may be violated unknowingly. We have compliance programs in place, including policies,training and various forms of monitoring, designed to address these risks. Nonetheless, these programs and policies may not always protect us from conduct by individual employees that violate these laws. Violations or allegations of violations ofthese laws may result in large civil and criminal penalties, debarment from participating in government programs, diversion of management time, attention and resources and may otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition andresults of operations. For more information related to the companys ongoing government investigations, please refer to Note 16 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The laws and regulations discussed above are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costassociated with compliance or to alter one or more of our sales and marketing practices and may subject us to enforcement actions which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If reimbursement or other payment for our current or future products is reduced or modified in the United States or abroad, including through theimplementation of government-sponsored healthcare reform or other similar actions, cost containment measures, or changes to policies with respect to pricing, taxation or rebates, then our business could suffer. Sales of our products depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our products are paid by both public and private payors. These payors includeMedicare, Medicaid, and private health care insurers in the United States and foreign governments and third-party payors outside the United States. Public and private payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products andservices. We may continue to experience continued downward pricing pressures from any or all of these payors which could result in an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operational results. Global efforts toward healthcare cost containment continue to exert pressure on product pricing. Governments around the world use various mechanisms tocontrol healthcare expenditures such as price controls, the formation of public contracting authorities, product formularies (lists of recommended or approved products), and competitive tenders which require the submission of a bid to sell products.Sales of our products are dependent, in part, on the availability of reimbursement by government agencies and healthcare programs, as well as insurance companies and other private payors. In much of Europe, Latin America, Asia and Australia, forexample, the government provides healthcare at low cost to patients, and controls its expenditures by purchasing products through public tenders, collective purchasing, regulating prices, setting reference prices in public tenders or limitingreimbursement or patient access to certain products. Additionally, austerity measures or other reforms by foreign governments may limit, reduce or eliminate payments for our products and adversely affect both pricing flexibility and demand for ourproducts.  For example, in the United States the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), which was signed into law in March 2010,includes several provisions which impact our businesses in the United States, including increased Medicaid rebates and an expansion of the 340B Drug Pricing Program which provides certain qualified entities, such as hospitals serving disadvantagedpopulations, with discounts on the purchase of drugs for outpatient use and an excise tax on the sale of certain drugs. We may also experience downward pricing pressure as the PPACA reduces Medicare and Medicaid payments to hospitals and otherproviders. While it is intended to expand health insurance coverage and increase access to medical care generally, the long-term impact of the PPACA on our business and the demand for our products is uncertain. As a result of these and other measures, including future measures or reforms that cannot be predicted, reimbursement may not be available or sufficientto allow us to sell our products on a competitive basis.   8 Table of ContentsLegislation and regulations affecting reimbursement for our products may change at any time and in ways that may be adverse to us. We cannot predict the impact of these pressures and initiatives,or any negative effects of any additional regulations that may affect our business.  There is substantial competition in the productmarkets in which we operate and in the development of alliances with research, academic and governmental institutions.  Although nosingle company competes with us in all of our businesses, we face substantial competition in both of our segments from international and domestic healthcare and pharmaceutical companies of all sizes. Competition is primarily focused oncost-effectiveness, price, service, product performance, and technological innovation.  Competition may increase further as additionalcompanies begin to enter our markets or modify their existing products to compete directly with ours. If our competitors respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, our products may be rendered obsoleteor non-competitive. If our competitors develop more effective or affordable products, or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than we do, our operations will likely be negatively affected. If we are forced to reduce ourprices due to increased competition, our business could become less profitable. The companys sales could be adversely affected if any of its contracts with GPOs, IDNs or other customers are terminated due to increased competition or otherwise. We also face competition for marketing, distribution and collaborative development agreements, for establishing relationships with academicand research institutions, and for licenses to intellectual property. In addition, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations may also conduct research, seek patent protection and establishcollaborative arrangements for discovery, research, clinical development and marketing of products similar to ours. These companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel as well asin acquiring technologies complementary to our programs. If we are unable to successfully compete with these companies and institutions, our business may suffer.  If our business development activities are unsuccessful, our business could suffer and our financial performance could be adversely affected. As part of our long-term strategy, we are engaged in business development activities including evaluating acquisitions, joint development opportunities,technology licensing arrangements and other opportunities. These activities may result in substantial investment of the companys resources. Our success developing products or expanding into new markets from such activities will depend on anumber of factors, including our ability to find suitable opportunities for acquisition, investment or alliance; whether we are able to complete an acquisition, investment or alliance on terms that are satisfactory to us; the strength of the othercompanys underlying technology, products and ability to execute its business strategies; any intellectual property and litigation related to these products or technology; and our ability to successfully integrate the acquired company,business, product, technology or research into our existing operations, including the ability to adequately fund acquired in-process research and development projects and to maintain adequate controls over the combined operations. Certain of theseactivities are subject to antitrust and competition laws, which laws could impact our ability to pursue strategic transactions and could result in mandated divestitures in the context of proposed acquisitions. If we are unsuccessful in our businessdevelopment activities, we may be unable to meet our financial targets and our financial performance could be adversely affected.  For moreinformation on recent business development activities, see Note 5 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.   9 Table of ContentsThe nature of producing plasma-based therapies may prevent us from timely responding to market forcesand effectively managing our production capacity.  The production of plasma-based therapies is a lengthy and complex process, and wesource our plasma both externally and internally through BioLife Plasma Services L.P. (BioLife), our wholly-owned subsidiary. Efforts to increase the collection of plasma or the production of plasma-based therapies may include the construction andregulatory approval of additional plasma collection facilities and plasma fractionation facilities. We are in the process of building a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility near Covington, Georgia to support growth of our plasma-based treatments,with commercial production scheduled to begin in 2018. The development of such facilities involves a lengthy regulatory process and is highly capital intensive. In addition, access to,transport and use of plasma may be subject to restrictions bygovernmental agencies both inside and outside the United States. As a result, our ability to match our collection and production of plasma-based therapies to market demand is imprecise and may result in a failure to meet market demand for ourplasma-based therapies or, alternatively, an oversupply of inventory. Failure to meet market demand for our plasma-based therapies may result in customers transitioning to available competitive products resulting in a loss of market share orcustomer confidence. In the event of an oversupply, we may be forced to lower the prices we charge for some of our plasma-based therapies, close collection and processing facilities, record asset impairment charges or take other action which mayadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  If we are unable to obtain sufficient components or rawmaterials on a timely basis or if we experience other manufacturing or supply difficulties, our business may be adversely affected. The manufacture of our products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of quality components and materials. We manufacture our products inmore than 50 manufacturing facilities around the world. We acquire our components and materials from many suppliers in various countries. We work closely with our suppliers to ensure the continuity of supply but we cannot guarantee these effortswill always be successful. Further, while efforts are made to diversify our sources of components and materials, in certain instances we acquire components and materials from a sole supplier. For most of our components and materials for which a solesupplier is used, we believe that alternative sources of supply exist and have made a strategic determination to use a sole supplier. In very limited instances, however, we do rely upon sole supplier relationships for which no alternatives havecurrently been identified. Although we do carry strategic inventory and maintain insurance to mitigate the potential risk related to any related supply disruption, there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective. Due to the regulatoryenvironment in which we operate, we may be unable to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for some components or materials. A reduction or interruption in supply, and an inability to develop alternative sources for such supply, couldadversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in a timely or cost-effective manner, and our ability to make product sales.  Many ofour products are difficult to manufacture. This is due to the complex nature of manufacturing pharmaceuticals, including biologics, and devices, as well as the strict regulatory regime governing our manufacturing operations. Variations in themanufacturing process may result in production failures which could lead to launch delays, product shortage, unanticipated costs, lost revenues and damage to our reputation. A failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to therelease of products to our customers may also result in a quality or safety issue of the type discussed above.  Several of our products aremanufactured at a single manufacturing facility or stored at a single storage site. Loss or damage to a manufacturing facility or storage site due to a natural disaster or otherwise could adversely affect our ability to manufacture sufficientquantities of key products or otherwise deliver products to meet customer demand or contractual requirements which may result in a loss of revenue and other adverse business consequences. Because of the time required to approve and license amanufacturing facility a third party manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis to replace production capacity in the event we lose manufacturing capacity or products are otherwise unavailable due to natural disaster, regulatory action orotherwise.   10 Table of ContentsThe proposed spin-off of Baxters biopharmaceutical business may not be completed on the terms ortimeline currently contemplated, if at all, and may not achieve the intended results.  In March 2014, Baxter announced plans to createtwo separate, independent global healthcare companies  one focused on developing and marketing innovative biopharmaceuticals and the other on life-saving medical products  through a tax-free distribution to Baxter shareholders ofpublicly traded stock in the new biopharmaceuticals company. The transaction is expected to be completed by mid-year 2015. Unanticipated developments could delay, prevent or otherwise adversely affect this proposed spin-off, including but notlimited to disruptions in general market conditions or potential problems or delays in obtaining various regulatory, tax and works council approvals or clearances. In addition, consummation of the proposed spin-off will require final approval fromour Board of Directors. Therefore, we cannot assure that we will be able to complete the spin-off on the terms or on the timeline that we announced, if at all.  We will incur significant expenses in connection with the spin-off. In addition, completion of the proposed spin-off will require significant amounts of managements time and effort which may divertmanagements attention from other aspects of our business operations. Further, if the spin-off is completed, it may not achieve the intended results. The spin-off will also require modifications to the companys systems and processes usedto operate our business and accurately maintain the companys books and records. We may experience delays, increased costs and other difficulties related to these modifications which could adversely affect our business operations, results ofoperations or financial condition.  If we are unable to protect our patents or other proprietary rights, or if we infringe the patentsor other proprietary rights of others, our competitiveness and business prospects may be materially damaged.  Patent and otherproprietary rights are essential to our business. Our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain and enforce patents and licenses to patent rights, both in the United States and in other countries. We cannot guarantee thatpending patent applications will result in issued patents, that patents issued or licensed will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, that our patents will not be found to be invalid or that the intellectual property rights of otherswill not prevent the company from selling certain products or including key features in the companys products.  The patent position of ahealthcare company is often uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. Significant litigation concerning patents and products is pervasive in our industry. Patent claims include challenges to the coverage and validity of our patentson products or processes as well as allegations that our products infringe patents held by competitors or other third parties. A loss in any of these types of cases could result in a loss of patent protection or the ability to market products, whichcould lead to a significant loss of sales, or otherwise materially affect future results of operations. We also rely on trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and know-how to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive positions. Third partiesmay know, discover or independently develop equivalent proprietary information or techniques, or they may gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our trade secrets to the public.  Although our employees, consultants, parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners are generally subject to confidentiality or similar agreements to protect our confidential andproprietary information, these agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. To the extent that our employees, consultants, parties to collaboration agreements and other business partners use intellectual propertyowned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.  Furthermore, ourintellectual property, other proprietary technology and other sensitive company data is potentially vulnerable to loss, damage or misappropriation from system malfunction, computer viruses, unauthorized access to our data or misappropriation ormisuse thereof by those with permitted access and other events. While we have invested to protect our intellectual property and other data, and continue to work   11 Table of Contentsdiligently in this area, there can be no assurance that our precautionary measures will prevent breakdowns, breaches, cyber incidents or other events. Such events could have a material adverseeffect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.  Misappropriation or other loss of our intellectual propertyfrom any of the foregoing would have an adverse effect on our competitive position and may cause us to incur substantial litigation costs. We are subject to risks associated with doing business globally.  Our operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business globally and under the laws, regulations and customs of various jurisdictions and geographies. These risks include changes in exchangecontrols and other governmental actions, loss of business in government and public tenders that are held annually in many cases, increasingly complex labor environments, availability of raw materials, changes in taxation, export controlrestrictions, changes in or violations of U.S. or local laws, including the FCPA and the United Kingdom Bribery Act, dependence on a few government entities as customers, pricing restrictions, economic and political instability (includinginstability as it relates to the Euro and currencies in certain emerging market countries), disputes between countries, diminished or insufficient protection of intellectual property, and disruption or destruction of operations in a significantgeographic region regardless of cause, including war, terrorism, riot, civil insurrection or social unrest. Failure to comply with, or material changes to, the laws and regulations that affect our global operations could have an adverse effect onour business, financial condition or results of operations.  Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates could have amaterial adverse effect on our operating results and liquidity.  We generate the majority of our revenue outside the United States. Asa result, our financial results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or our ability to mitigate these risks. We may experienceadditional volatility as a result of inflationary pressures and other macroeconomic factors in certain emerging market countries. We are also exposed to changes in interest rates, and our ability to access the money markets and capital markets couldbe impeded if adverse liquidity market conditions occur. A discussion of the financial impact of foreign exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations, and the ways and extent to which we attempt to mitigate such impact is contained under the captionFinancial Instrument Market Risk in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Changes in tax laws or exposure toadditional income tax liabilities may have a negative impact on our operating results.  Tax policy reform continues to be a topic ofdiscussion in the United States. A significant change to the tax system in the United States, including changes to the taxation of international income, could have an adverse effect upon our results of operations. Because we operate in multipleincome tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States, we are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes. We regularly assess the likelyoutcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision. However, we may not accurately predict the outcome of these audits, and as a result the actual outcome of these audits may have an adverse impact on ourfinancial results. For more information on ongoing audits, see Note 15 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  We areincreasingly dependent on information technology systems, and our systems and infrastructure face certain risks, including from cyber security breaches and data leakage.  We increasingly rely upon technology systems and infrastructure. Our technology systems are potentially vulnerable to breakdown or other interruption by fire, power loss, system malfunction, unauthorizedaccess and   12 Table of Contentsother events. Likewise, data privacy breaches by employees and others with both permitted and unauthorized access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorizedpersons or to the public, or may be permanently lost. The increasing use and evolution of technology, including cloud-based computing, creates additional opportunities for the unintentional dissemination of information, intentional destruction ofconfidential information stored in our systems or in non-encrypted portable media or storage devices. We could also experience a business interruption, information theft of confidential information, or reputational damage from industrial espionageattacks, malware or other cyber incidents, which may compromise our system infrastructure or lead to data leakage, either internally or at our third-party providers or other business partners. While we have invested heavily in the protection of dataand information technology and in related training, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent significant breakdowns, breaches in our systems or other cyber incidents that could have a material adverse effect upon our reputation,business, operations or financial condition. In addition, significant implementation issues may arise as we continue to consolidate and outsource certain computer operations and application support activities. If we fail to attract and retain key employees our business may suffer.  Our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees, including people in senior management, sales, marketing and research positions. Competition for top talent inhealthcare can be intense. Our ability to recruit and retain such talent will depend on a number of factors, including hiring practices of our competitors, compensation and benefits, work location, work environment and industry economic conditions.If we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified employees, our business could suffer.  We are subject to a number of pendinglawsuits.  We are a defendant in a number of pending lawsuits. In addition, we may be named as a defendant in future patent, productliability or other lawsuits. These current and future matters may result in a loss of patent protection, reduced revenue, significant liabilities and diversion of our managements time, attention and resources. Given the uncertain nature oflitigation generally, we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in these current matters. In view of these uncertainties, the outcome of these matters may result in charges inexcess of any established reserves, and, to the extent available, liability insurance. We also continue to be self-insured with respect to product liability claims. The absence of third-party insurance coverage for current or future claims increasesour potential exposure to unanticipated claims and adverse decisions. Protracted litigation, including any adverse outcomes, may have an adverse impact on the business, operations or financial condition of the company. Even claims without meritcould subject us to adverse publicity and require us to incur significant legal fees. See Note 16 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding current lawsuits. Current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect our business and financial condition. The companys ability to generate cash flows from operations could be affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the companysproducts, in the solvency of its customers or suppliers, or deterioration in the companys key financial ratios or credit ratings. Current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of our customers (includinggovernments) to pay for our products and services, and the amount spent on healthcare generally. This could result in a decrease in the demand for our products and services, declining cash flows, longer sales cycles, slower adoption of newtechnologies and increased price competition. These conditions may also adversely affect certain of our suppliers, which could cause a disruption in our ability to produce our products. We continue to do business with foreign governments in certaincountries, including Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy, that have experienced a deterioration in credit and economic conditions. As of December 31, 2014, the companys net accounts receivable from the public sector in Greece, Spain,Portugal and Italy totaled $363 million. While global economic conditions have not significantly impacted the companys ability to collect receivables, liquidity issues in certain countries have resulted, and may continue to result, in delaysin the collection of receivables and credit losses. These conditions may also impact the stability of the   13 Table of ContentsEuro. For more information on accounts receivable and credit matters with respect to certain of these countries, refer to the discussion under the caption entitled Credit Facilities, Accessto Capital and Credit Ratings in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.   "

.  Inaddition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, shareholders or prospective investors should carefully consider the following risk factors. If any of the events described below occurs, our business, financial condition andresults of operations and future growth prospects could suffer.  If we are unable to successfully introduce new products or fail to keeppace with advances in technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.  We need tosuccessfully introduce new products to achieve our strategic business objectives. Product development requires substantial investment and there is inherent risk in the research and development process. A successful product development processdepends on many factors, including our ability to properly anticipate and satisfy customer needs, adapt to new technologies, obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis, demonstrate satisfactory clinical results, manufacture products in aneconomical and timely manner and differentiate our products from those of our competitors.

Our facilities must be approved and licensed prior to production and remain subject to inspection from time to time thereafter.Failure to comply with the requirements of FDA or other regulatory authorities, including a failed inspection or a failure in our adverse event reporting system, could result in adverse inspection reports, warning letters, product recalls orseizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt the manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a government to grant approvals or licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals andlicenses. Any of these actions could cause a loss of customer confidence in us and our products, which could adversely affect our sales. The requirements of regulatory authorities, including interpretative guidance, are subject to change andcompliance with additional or changing requirements or interpretative guidance may subject the company to further review, result in product launch delays or otherwise increase our costs. For information on current  6 Table of Contentsregulatory issues affecting us, please refer to the caption entitled Certain Regulatory Matters in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In connection with theseissues, there can be no assurance that additional costs or civil and criminal penalties will not be incurred, that additional regulatory actions with respect to the company will not occur, that the company will not face civil claims for damages frompurchasers or users, that substantial additional charges or significant asset impairments may not be required, that sales of other products may not be adversely affected, or that additional regulation will not be introduced that may adversely affectthe companys operations and consolidated financial statements.

Violations, or allegations of violations, of these laws may result in large civil and criminal penalties, debarment from participating in government programs, diversion of management time, attention and resources and may otherwise have anadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For more information related to the Companys ongoing government investigations, please refer to Note 15 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The laws and regulations discussed above are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which could require us to incursubstantial cost associated with compliance or to alter one or more of our sales and marketing practices and may subject us to enforcement actions which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Issues with product quality could have an adverse effect upon our business, subject us to regulatory actions and cause a loss of customerconfidence in us or our products.  Our success depends upon the quality of our products. Quality management plays an essential role indetermining and meeting customer requirements, preventing defects, improving the companys products and services and assuring the safety and efficacy of our products. Our future success depends on our ability to maintain and continuouslyimprove our quality management program. While we have one quality system deployed globally that covers the lifecycle of our products, quality and safety issues may occur with respect to any of our products. A quality or safety issue may result inadverse inspection reports, warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, costly litigation, refusal of a government to grant approvalsand licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. An inability to address a quality or safety issue in an effective and timely manner may also cause negative publicity, a loss of customer confidence in us orour current or future products, which may result in the loss of sales and difficulty in successfully launching new products. Additionally, Baxter   7 Table of Contentshas made and continues to make significant investments in assets, including inventory and property, plant and equipment, which relate to potential new products or modifications to existingproducts. Product quality or safety issues may restrict the company from being able to realize the expected returns from these investments, potentially resulting in asset impairments in the future. Unaffiliated third party suppliers provide a number of goods and services to our R&D, clinical and manufacturing organizations. Third party suppliersare required to comply with our quality standards. Failure of a third party supplier to provide compliant raw materials or supplies could result in delays, service interruptions or other quality related issues that may negatively impact our businessresults. In addition, some of the raw materials employed in our production processes are derived from human and animal origins, requiring robust controls to eliminate the potential for introduction of pathogenic agents or other contaminants. For more information on regulatory matters currently affecting us, refer to the discussion under the caption entitled CertainRegulatory Matters in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The implementation of healthcare reform in the UnitedStates may adversely affect our business.  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), which was signed into law in March2010, includes several provisions which impact the companys businesses in the United States, including increased Medicaid rebates and an expansion of the 340B Drug Pricing Program which provides certain qualified entities, such as hospitalsserving disadvantaged populations, with discounts on the purchase of drugs for outpatient use and an excise tax on the sale of certain drugs and medical devices. In 2011, the company became subject to a tax on the sales of its pharmaceuticalproducts to the government, and in 2013, the company became subject to a 2.3% tax on sales of certain of its medical devices. The impact of the increased Medicaid rebates and the expanded 340B Drug Pricing Program is largely to our BioSciencebusiness, while the additional taxes impact both of our business segments. We may also experience downward pricing pressure as the PPACA reduces Medicare and Medicaid payments to hospitals. While it is intended to expand health insurance coverageand increase access to medical care generally, the long-term impact of the PPACA on our business and the demand for our products is uncertain. Similarly, we cannot predict the impact of the additional regulations that need to be established toimplement many of the PPACAs provisions.  If reimbursement for our current or future products is reduced or modified in the UnitedStates or abroad, our business could suffer.  Sales of our products depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our productsare paid by both public and private payors. These payors include Medicare, Medicaid, and private health care insurers in the United States and foreign governments and third-party payors outside the United States. Public and private payors areincreasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. We may continue to experience continued downward pricing pressures from any or all of these payors which could result in an adverse effect on our business, financialcondition and operational results.  Austerity measures or other reforms by foreign governments may limit, reduce or eliminate payments for ourproducts and adversely affect both our pricing flexibility and demand for our products. Accordingly, reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive basis. Legislation and regulations affectingreimbursement for our products may change at any time and in ways that may be adverse to us.  There is substantial competition in theproduct markets in which we operate and in the development of alliances with research, academic and governmental institutions. Although no single company competes with us in all of our businesses, we face substantial competition in both of our segments from international anddomestic healthcare and pharmaceutical companies of all sizes. Competition is primarily focused on cost-effectiveness, price, service, product performance, and technological innovation.   8 Table of ContentsCompetition may increase further as additional companies begin to enter our markets or modify their existing products to compete directly with ours. If our competitors respond more quickly to newor emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, our products may be rendered obsolete or non-competitive. If our competitors develop more effective or affordable products, or achieve earlier patent protection or productcommercialization than we do, our operations will likely be negatively affected. If we are forced to reduce our prices due to increased competition, our business could become less profitable. The companys sales could be adversely affected ifany of its contracts with GPOs, IDNs or other customers are terminated due to increased competition or otherwise.  We also face competitionfor marketing, distribution and collaborative development agreements, for establishing relationships with academic and research institutions, and for licenses to intellectual property. In addition, academic institutions, government agencies andother public and private research organizations may also conduct research, seek patent protection and establish collaborative arrangements for discovery, research, clinical development and marketing of products similar to ours. These companies andinstitutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our programs. If we are unable to successfully compete with these companies andinstitutions, our business may suffer.  The nature of producing plasma-based therapies may prevent us from timely responding to marketforces and effectively managing our production capacity.  The production of plasma-based therapies is a lengthy and complex process.Efforts to increase the collection of plasma or the production of plasma-based therapies may include the construction and regulatory approval of additional plasma collection facilities and/or plasma fractionation facilities. The development of suchfacilities can be a lengthy regulatory and capital intensive process. As a result, our ability to match our collection and production of plasma-based therapies to market demand is imprecise and may result in a failure to meet the market demand forour plasma-based therapies or potentially an oversupply of inventory. Failure to meet market demand for our plasma-based therapies may result in customers transitioning to available competitive products resulting in a loss of segment share orcustomer confidence. In the event of an oversupply we may be forced to lower the prices we charge for some of our plasma-based therapies, close collection and processing facilities, record asset impairment charges or take other action which mayadversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  If we are unable to obtain sufficient components or rawmaterials on a timely basis or if we experience other manufacturing or supply difficulties, our business may be adversely affected. The manufacture of our products requires the timely delivery of sufficient amounts of quality components and materials. We manufacture our products inmore than 50 manufacturing facilities around the world. We acquire our components and materials from many suppliers in various countries. We work closely with our suppliers to ensure the continuity of supply but we cannot guarantee these effortswill always be successful. Further, while efforts are made to diversify our sources of components and materials, in certain instances we acquire components and materials from a sole supplier. Due to the regulatory environment in which we operate, wemay be unable to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for some components or materials. A reduction or interruption in supply, and an inability to develop alternative sources for such supply, could adversely affect our ability tomanufacture our products in a timely or cost-effective manner, and our ability to make product sales.  Many of our products are difficult tomanufacture. This is due to the complex nature of manufacturing pharmaceuticals, including biologics, and devices, as well as the strict regulatory regime governing our manufacturing operations. Variations in the manufacturing process may result inproduction failures which could lead to launch delays, product shortage, unanticipated costs, lost revenues and damage to our reputation. A failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers mayalso result in a quality or safety issue of the type discussed above.   9 Table of ContentsSeveral of our products are manufactured at a single manufacturing facility. Loss or damage to amanufacturing facility due to a natural disaster or otherwise could adversely affect our ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of key products to meet customer demand or contractual requirements which may result in a loss of revenue and otheradverse business consequences. Because of the time required to approve and license a manufacturing facility a third party manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis to replace production capacity in the event we lose manufacturing capacitydue to natural disaster, regulatory action or otherwise.  If we are unable to protect our patents or other proprietary rights, or if weinfringe the patents or other proprietary rights of others, our competitiveness and business prospects may be materially damaged. Patent and other proprietary rights are essential to our business. Our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain and enforcepatents and licenses to patent rights, both in the United States and in other countries. We cannot guarantee that pending patent applications will result in issued patents, that patents issued or licensed will not be challenged or circumvented bycompetitors, that our patents will not be found to be invalid or that the intellectual property rights of others will not prevent the company from selling certain products or including key features in the companys products. The patent position of a healthcare company is often uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. Significant litigation concerningpatents and products is pervasive in our industry. Patent claims include challenges to the coverage and validity of our patents on products or processes as well as allegations that our products infringe patents held by competitors or other thirdparties. A loss in any of these types of cases could result in a loss of patent protection or the ability to market products, which could lead to a significant loss of sales, or otherwise materially affect future results of operations. We also relyon trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and know-how to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive positions. Third parties may know, discover or independently develop equivalent proprietary information or techniques, or they may gain accessto our trade secrets or disclose our trade secrets to the public. Misappropriation or other loss of our intellectual property would have an adverse effect on our competitive position and may cause us to incur substantial litigation costs. If our business development activities are unsuccessful, including our integration of Gambro, our business could suffer and ourfinancial performance could be adversely affected.  As part of our long-term strategy, we are engaged in business developmentactivities including evaluating acquisitions, joint development opportunities, technology licensing arrangements and other opportunities. These activities may result in substantial investment of the companys resources. Our success developingproducts or expanding into new markets from such activities will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to find suitable opportunities for acquisition, investment or alliance; whether we are able to complete an acquisition, investmentor alliance on terms that are satisfactory to us; the strength of the other companys underlying technology, products and ability to execute its business strategies; any intellectual property and litigation related to these products ortechnology; and our ability to successfully integrate the acquired company, business, product, technology or research into our existing operations, including the ability to adequately fund acquired in-process research and development projects and tomaintain adequate controls over the combined operations. Certain of these activities are subject to antitrust and competition laws, which laws could impact our ability to pursue strategic transactions and could result in mandated divestitures in thecontext of proposed acquisitions. If we are unsuccessful in our business development activities, we may be unable to meet our financial targets and our financial performance could be adversely affected. In September 2013, we completed the acquisition of Gambro for a total purchase price of $3.7 billion, excluding adjustments for net indebtedness, whichwas financed in part by proceeds of approximately $3.0 billion from debt issuances in June 2013. These additional debt issuances significantly increased the companys outstanding debt and will require us to dedicate a portion of our cash flowto servicing this debt, thereby reducing the availability of cash to fund other business initiatives. The integration of Gambros operations will require   10 Table of Contentssignificant efforts, including the coordination of information technologies, research and development, sales, marketing, operations, manufacturing and finance. These efforts will result inadditional expenses and involve significant amounts of managements time that cannot be dedicated to other projects. Our failure to successfully integrate Gambros operations into our own could result in a failure to achieve expectedsynergies. A failure to achieve our strategic objectives with respect to the Gambro acquisition could result in slower growth, higher than expected costs, the closure of facilities, the recording of asset impairment charges and other actions whichcould adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  For more information on recent business developmentactivities, see Note 4 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  We are subject to risks associated with doing businessglobally.  Our operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business globally and under the laws, regulations and customs ofvarious jurisdictions and geographies. These risks include changes in exchange controls and other governmental actions, loss of business in government and public tenders that are held annually in many cases, increasingly complex labor environments,availability of raw materials, changes in taxation, export control restrictions, changes in or violations of U.S. or local laws, including the FCPA and the United Kingdom Bribery Act, dependence on a few government entities as customers,pricing restrictions, economic and political instability (including instability as it relates to the Euro and currencies in certain emerging market countries), disputes between countries, diminished or insufficient protection of intellectualproperty, and disruption or destruction of operations in a significant geographic region regardless of cause, including war, terrorism, riot, civil insurrection or social unrest. Failure to comply with, or material changes to, the laws andregulations that affect our global operations could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We are subject to foreign currency exchange risk.  We generate the majority of our revenue outside the United States. As a result, our financial results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We cannot predict withany certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or our ability to mitigate these risks. We may experience additional volatility as a result of inflationary pressures and other macroeconomic factors in certain emerging market countries. Adiscussion of the financial impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, and the ways and extent to which we attempt to mitigate such impact is contained under the caption Financial Instrument Market Risk in Item 7 of this AnnualReport on Form 10-K.  Changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities may have a negative impact on ouroperating results.  Tax policy reform continues to be a topic of discussion in the United States. A significant change to the taxsystem in the United States, including changes to the taxation of international income, could have an adverse effect upon our results of operations. Because we operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States,we are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriatenessof our tax provision. However, we may not accurately predict the outcome of these audits, and as a result the actual outcome of these audits may have an adverse impact on our financial results. For more information on ongoing audits, see Note 14 inItem 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  We are increasingly dependent on information technology systems andinfrastructure.  We increasingly rely upon technology systems and infrastructure. Our technology systems are potentially vulnerable tobreakdown or other interruption by fire, power loss, system malfunction, unauthorized access and   11 Table of Contentsother events. Likewise, data privacy breaches by employees and others with both permitted and unauthorized access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorizedpersons or to the public, or may be permanently lost. While we have invested heavily in the protection of data and information technology and in related training, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent significant breakdowns,breaches in our systems or other cyber incidents that could have a material adverse effect upon the reputation, business, operations or financial condition of the company. In addition, significant implementation issues may arise as we continue toconsolidate and outsource certain computer operations and application support activities.  We may experience difficulties implementingour new global enterprise resource planning system.  We are engaged in a multi-year implementation of a new global enterprise resourceplanning system (ERP). The ERP is designed to accurately maintain the companys books and records and provide information important to the operation of the business to the companys management team. The companys ERP will continue torequire significant investment of human and financial resources. In implementing the ERP, we may experience significant delays, increased costs and other difficulties. Any significant disruption or deficiency in the design and implementation of theERP could adversely affect our ability to process orders, ship product, send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business.  If we fail to attract and retain key employees our business may suffer.  Our abilityto compete effectively depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees, including people in senior management, sales, marketing and research positions. Competition for top talent in healthcare can be intense. Our ability to recruit andretain such talent will depend on a number of factors, including hiring practices of our competitors, compensation and benefits, work location, work environment and industry economic conditions. If we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualifiedemployees, our business could suffer.  We are subject to a number of pending lawsuits. We are a defendant in a number of pending lawsuits. In addition, we may be named as a defendant in future patent, product liability or other lawsuits.These current and future matters may result in a loss of patent protection, reduced revenue, significant liabilities and diversion of our managements time, attention and resources. Given the uncertain nature of litigation generally, we are notable in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in these current matters. In view of these uncertainties, the outcome of these matters may result in charges in excess of any establishedreserves, and, to the extent available, liability insurance. We also continue to be self-insured with respect to product liability claims. The absence of third-party insurance coverage for current or future claims increases our potential exposure tounanticipated claims and adverse decisions. Protracted litigation, including any adverse outcomes, may have an adverse impact on the business, operations or financial condition of the company. Even claims without merit could subject us to adversepublicity and require us to incur significant legal fees. See Note 15 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding current lawsuits.  Current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect our business and financial condition.  The companys ability to generate cash flows from operations could be affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the companys products, in the solvency of its customers orsuppliers, or deterioration in the companys key financial ratios or credit ratings. Current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of our customers (including governments) to pay for our products and services, andthe amount spent on healthcare generally. This could result in a decrease in the demand for our products and services, declining cash flows, longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. These conditionsmay also adversely affect certain of our suppliers, which could cause a disruption in our ability to produce our products. We continue to do business with foreign governments in certain countries, including Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy, thathave experienced a deterioration in credit and economic conditions. As of   12 Table of ContentsDecember 31, 2013, the companys net accounts receivable from the public sector in Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy totaled $561 million (of which $29 million is related to Greece).This amount reflects an increase of $176 million during 2013 primarily as a result of the acquisition of Gambro. While the economic downturn has not significantly impacted our ability to collect receivables, global economic conditions and liquidityissues in certain countries have resulted, and may continue to result, in delays in the collection of receivables and credit losses. These conditions may also impact the stability of the Euro. For more information on accounts receivable and creditmatters with respect to certain of these countries, refer to the discussion under the caption entitled Credit Facilities, Access to Capital and Credit Ratings in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  "
0,BAX,BAXTER INTERNATIONAL INC,2013-02-21,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
.   Inaddition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, shareholders or prospective investors should carefully consider the following risk factors. If any of the events described below occurs, our business, financial condition andresults of operations and future growth prospects could suffer.  If we are unable to successfully introduce new products or fail to keeppace with advances in technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.  We need tosuccessfully introduce new products to achieve our strategic business objectives. Product development requires substantial investment and there is inherent risk in the research and development process. A successful product development processdepends on many factors, including our ability to properly anticipate and satisfy customer needs, adapt to new technologies, obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis, demonstrate satisfactory clinical results, manufacture products in aneconomical and timely manner and differentiate our products from those of our competitors. If we cannot successfully introduce new products or adapt to changing technologies, our products may become obsolete and our revenue and profitability couldsuffer.  We are subject to a number of existing laws and regulations, non-compliance with which could adversely affect our business,financial condition and results of operations, and we are susceptible to a changing regulatory environment.  As a participant in thehealthcare industry, our operations and products, and those of our customers, are regulated by numerous government agencies, both inside and outside the United States. The impact of this on us is direct, to the extent we are subject to these lawsand regulations, and indirect in that in a number of situations, even though we may not be directly regulated by specific healthcare laws and regulations, our products must be capable of being used by our customers in a manner that complies withthose laws and regulations.  The manufacture, distribution, marketing and use of our products are subject to extensive regulation andincreased scrutiny by FDA and other regulatory authorities globally. Any new product must undergo lengthy and rigorous testing and other extensive, costly and time-consuming procedures mandated by FDA and foreign regulatory authorities. Changes tocurrent products may be subject to vigorous review, including additional 510(k) and other regulatory submissions, and approvals are not certain. Our facilities must be approved and licensed prior to production and remain subject to inspection fromtime to time thereafter. Failure to comply with the requirements of FDA or other regulatory authorities, including a failed inspection or a failure in our adverse event reporting system, could result in adverse inspection reports, warning letters,product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt the manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a government to grant approvals or licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal ofexisting approvals and licenses. Any of these actions could cause a loss of customer confidence in us and our products, which could adversely affect our sales. The requirements of regulatory authorities, including interpretative guidance, aresubject to change and compliance with additional or changing requirements or interpretative guidance may subject the company to further review, result in product launch delays or otherwise increase our costs. For information on current regulatoryissues affecting us, please refer to the caption entitled Certain Regulatory Matters in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In connection with these issues, there can be no assurance that additional costs or civil andcriminal penalties will not be incurred, that additional regulatory actions with respect to the company will not occur, that the company will not face civil claims for damages from purchasers or users, that substantial additional charges orsignificant asset impairments may not be required, that sales of other products may not be adversely affected, or that additional regulation will not be introduced that may adversely affect the companys operations and consolidated financialstatements.   6 Table of ContentsThe sales, marketing and pricing of products and relationships that pharmaceutical and medical devicecompanies have with healthcare providers are under increased scrutiny by federal, state and foreign government agencies. Compliance with the Anti-Kickback Statute, False Claims Act, Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (including as these laws relate tooff-label promotion of products) and other healthcare related laws, as well as competition, data and patient privacy and export and import laws is under increased focus by the agencies charged with overseeing such activities, including FDA, OIG, DOJand the Federal Trade Commission. The DOJ and the Securities and Exchange Commission have also increased their focus on the enforcement of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), particularly as it relates to the conduct ofpharmaceutical companies. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws generally prohibit companies and their employees, contractors or agents from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.Healthcare professionals in many countries are employed by the government and consequently are considered government officials. Foreign governments have also increased their scrutiny of pharmaceutical companies sales and marketing activitiesand relationships with healthcare providers and competitive practices generally. The laws and standards governing the promotion, sale and reimbursement of our products and those governing our relationships with healthcare providers and governmentscan be complicated, are subject to frequent change and may be violated unknowingly. We have compliance programs in place, including policies, training and various forms of monitoring, designed to address these risks. Nonetheless, these programs andpolicies may not always protect us from conduct by individual employees that violate these laws. Violations, or allegations of violations, of these laws may result in large civil and criminal penalties, debarment from participating in governmentprograms, diversion of management time, attention and resources and may otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For more information related to the Companys ongoing governmentinvestigations, please refer to Note 13 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  The laws and regulations discussed aboveare broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial cost associated with compliance or to alter one or more of our sales and marketing practices and may subject us to enforcement actions whichcould adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Issues with product quality could have an adverseeffect upon our business, subject us to regulatory actions and cause a loss of customer confidence in us or our products.  Our successdepends upon the quality of our products. Quality management plays an essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements, preventing defects, improving the companys products and services and maintaining the integrity of the datathat supports the safety and efficacy of our products. Our future success depends on our ability to maintain and continuously improve our quality management program. While we have one quality system deployed globally that covers the lifecycle of ourproducts, quality and safety issues may occur with respect to any of our products. A quality or safety issue may result in adverse inspection reports, warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufactureand distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, costly litigation, refusal of a government to grant approvals and licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. An inability to address a quality orsafety issue in an effective and timely manner may also cause negative publicity, a loss of customer confidence in us or our current or future products, which may result in the loss of sales and difficulty in successfully launching new products. Unaffiliated third party suppliers provide a number of goods and services to our R&D, clinical and manufacturing organizations. Thirdparty suppliers are required to comply with our quality standards.

If we are unable to successfully compete with these companies and institutions, our business may suffer.  The nature of producing plasma-based therapies may prevent us from timely responding to market forces and effectively managing our production capacity. The production of plasma-based therapies is a lengthy and complex process. Efforts to increase the collection of plasma or the production of plasma-basedtherapies may include the construction and regulatory approval of additional plasma collection facilities and/or plasma fractionation facilities, such as the Covington, Georgia facility, the site selection of which we announced in April 2012. Thedevelopment of such facilities can be a lengthy regulatory and capital intensive process. As a result, our ability to match our collection and production of plasma-based therapies to market demand is imprecise and may result in a failure to meet themarket demand for our plasma-based therapies or potentially an oversupply of inventory. Failure to meet market demand for our plasma-based therapies may result in customers transitioning to available competitive products resulting in a loss ofsegment share or customer confidence.

Loss or damage to a manufacturingfacility due to a natural disaster or otherwise could adversely affect our ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of key products to meet customer demand or contractual requirements which may result in a loss of revenue and other adversebusiness consequences. Because of the time required to approve and license a manufacturing facility a third party manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis to replace production capacity in the event we lose manufacturing capacity due tonatural disaster, regulatory action or otherwise.  If we are unable to protect our patents or other proprietary rights, or if weinfringe the patents or other proprietary rights of others, our competitiveness and business prospects may be materially damaged. Patent and other proprietary rights are essential to our business. Our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain and enforcepatents and licenses to patent rights, both in the United States and in other   9 Table of Contentscountries. We cannot guarantee that pending patent applications will result in issued patents, that patents issued or licensed will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, that ourpatents will not be found to be invalid or that the intellectual property rights of others will not prevent the company from selling certain products or including key features in the companys products. The patent position of a healthcare company is often uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. Significant litigation concerningpatents and products is pervasive in our industry. Patent claims include challenges to the coverage and validity of our patents on products or processes as well as allegations that our products infringe patents held by competitors or other thirdparties. A loss in any of these types of cases could result in a loss of patent protection or the ability to market products, which could lead to a significant loss of sales, or otherwise materially affect future results of operations. We also rely on trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and know-how to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive positions. Third parties may know,discover or independently develop equivalent proprietary information or techniques, or they may gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our trade secrets to the public. Misappropriation or other loss of our intellectual property would have anadverse effect on our competitive position and may cause us to incur substantial litigation costs.  If our business developmentactivities are unsuccessful, our business could suffer and our financial performance could be adversely affected.  As part of ourlong-term strategy, we are engaged in business development activities including evaluating acquisitions, joint development opportunities, technology licensing arrangements and other opportunities. These activities may result in substantialinvestment of the companys resources. Our success developing products or expanding into new markets from such activities will depend on a number of factors, including our ability to find suitable opportunities for acquisition, investment oralliance; whether we are able to complete an acquisition, investment or alliance on terms that are satisfactory to us; the strength of the other companys underlying technology, products and ability to execute its business strategies; anyintellectual property and litigation related to these products or technology; and our ability to successfully integrate the acquired company, business, product, technology or research into our existing operations, including the ability to adequatelyfund acquired in-process research and development projects. If we are unsuccessful in our business development activities, we may be unable to meet our financial targets and our financial performance could be adversely affected. The proposed acquisition of Gambro AB may adversely affect our financial condition and our business. In December 2012, we announced an agreement to purchase Gambro AB (Gambro). The closing of the transaction is subject to regulatory approvals (includingmultiple antitrust approvals) and other closing conditions. While the closing of the transaction is expected to occur at the end of the second quarter of 2013, there can be no assurance that the closing will in fact occur or that significant delaysin closing the transaction will not result. A failure to close the transaction or significant delays in doing so may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock and our business, financial condition and results of operations. We expectto issue at least $3.0 billion of debt during the first half of 2013 to fund the planned acquisition of Gambro, which will significantly increase the companys outstanding debt. This additional indebtedness will require us to dedicate a portionof our cash flow to servicing this debt, thereby reducing the availability of cash to fund other business initiatives, including stock repurchases. We performed substantial due diligence in connection with this transaction but undiscovered andunanticipated risks and liabilities may emerge after the closing. The integration of Gambros operations will require significant efforts, including the coordination of information technologies, research and development, sales, marketing,operations, manufacturing and finance. These efforts will result in additional expenses and involve significant amounts of managements time that cannot be dedicated to other projects. Our failure to successfully integrate Gambrosoperations into our own could result in a failure to achieve expected synergies. A failure to achieve our strategic objectives with respect to the Gambro acquisition could result in slower growth, higher than expected costs, the closure offacilities, the recording of asset   10 Table of Contentsimpairment charges and other actions which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For more information on this acquisition, see Note 2 in Item 8of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  We are subject to risks associated with doing business globally. Our operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business globally and under the laws, regulations and customs of various jurisdictions andgeographies. These risks include changes in exchange controls and other governmental actions, loss of business in government and public tenders that are held annually in many cases, increasingly complex labor environments, availability of rawmaterials, changes in taxation, export control restrictions, changes in or violations of U.S. or local laws, including the FCPA and the United Kingdom Bribery Act, dependence on a few government entities as customers, pricing restrictions,economic and political instability (including instability as it relates to the Euro), disputes between countries, diminished or insufficient protection of intellectual property, and disruption or destruction of operations in a significant geographicregion regardless of cause, including war, terrorism, riot, civil insurrection or social unrest. Failure to comply with, or material changes to, the laws and regulations that affect our global operations could have an adverse effect on our business,financial condition or results of operations.  We are subject to foreign currency exchange risk. We generate the majority of our revenue outside the United States. As a result, our financial results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreigncurrency exchange rates. We cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or our ability to mitigate these risks. A discussion of the financial impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, and the ways and extent towhich we attempt to mitigate such impact, including the impact of restrictions on currency exchange imposed by the Venezuelan government, is contained under the caption Financial Instrument Market Risk in Item 7 of this AnnualReport on Form 10-K.  Changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilities may have a negative impact on ouroperating results.  Tax policy reform continues to be a topic of discussion in the United States. A significant change to the taxsystem in the United States, including changes to the taxation of international income, could have an adverse effect upon our results of operations. Because we operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States,we are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriatenessof our tax provision. However, we may not accurately predict the outcome of these audits, and as a result the actual outcome of these audits may have an adverse impact on our financial results. For more information on ongoing audits, see Note 12 inItem 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  We may experience difficulties implementing our new global enterprise resource planningsystem.  We are engaged in a multi-year implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning system (ERP). The ERP is designedto accurately maintain the companys books and records and provide information important to the operation of the business to the companys management team. The companys ERP will continue to require significant investment of human andfinancial resources. In implementing the ERP, we may experience significant delays, increased costs and other difficulties. Any significant disruption or deficiency in the design and implementation of the ERP could adversely affect our ability toprocess orders, ship product, send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business. While we have invested significant resources in planning and project management, significant implementation issues mayarise.   11 Table of ContentsWe are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure. We increasingly rely upon technology systems and infrastructure. Our technology systems are potentially vulnerable to breakdown orother interruption by fire, power loss, system malfunction, unauthorized access and other events. Likewise, data privacy breaches by employees and others with permitted access to our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data may be exposed tounauthorized persons or to the public. While we have invested heavily in the protection of data and information technology and in related training, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent significant breakdowns, breaches in oursystems or other cyber incidents that could have a material adverse effect upon our reputation, business, operations or financial condition of the company. In addition, significant implementation issues may arise as we continue to consolidate andoutsource certain computer operations and application support activities.  If we fail to attract and retain key employees our businessmay suffer.  Our ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract and retain key employees, including people in seniormanagement, sales, marketing and research positions. Competition for top talent in healthcare can be intense. Our ability to recruit and retain such talent will depend on a number of factors, including hiring practices of our competitors,compensation and benefits, work location, work environment and industry economic conditions. If we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified employees, our business could suffer.  We are subject to a number of pending lawsuits.  We are a defendant in a number ofpending lawsuits. In addition, we may be named as a defendant in future patent, product liability or other lawsuits. These current and future matters may result in a loss of patent protection, reduced revenue, significant liabilities and diversionof our managements time, attention and resources. Given the uncertain nature of litigation generally, we are not able in all cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in these current matters.In view of these uncertainties, the outcome of these matters may result in charges in excess of any established reserves, and, to the extent available, liability insurance. We also continue to be self-insured with respect to product liabilityclaims. The absence of third-party insurance coverage for current or future claims increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims and adverse decisions. Protracted litigation, including any adverse outcomes, may have an adverse impact onthe business, operations or financial condition of the company. Even claims without merit could subject us to adverse publicity and require us to incur significant legal fees. See Note 13 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-Kfor more information regarding current lawsuits.  Current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect our business andfinancial condition.  The companys ability to generate cash flows from operations could be affected if there is a materialdecline in the demand for the companys products, in the solvency of its customers or suppliers, or deterioration in the companys key financial ratios or credit ratings. Current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect theability of our customers (including governments) to pay for our products and services, and the amount spent on healthcare generally. This could result in a decrease in the demand for our products and services, declining cash flows, longer salescycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition. These conditions may also adversely affect certain of our suppliers, which could cause a disruption in our ability to produce our products. We continue to do business withforeign governments in certain countries, including Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy, that have experienced deterioration in credit and economic conditions. As of December 31, 2012, the companys net accounts receivable from the publicsector in Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy totaled $385 million (of which $66 million is related to Greece). The global economic conditions and governmental actions in these and other countries may continue to result in delays in the collection ofreceivables and require us to re-evaluate the collectibility and valuation of our receivables which could result in additional credit losses. These conditions may also impact the stability of the Euro. For more information on accounts receivable andcredit matters with respect to certain of these countries, refer to the discussion under the caption entitled Credit Facilities, Access to Capital and Credit Ratings in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.   12 Table of Contents"
12,BAX,BAXTER INTERNATIONAL INC,2012-02-23,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
.  Inaddition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, shareholders or prospective investors should carefully consider the following risk factors. If any of the events described below occurs, our business, financial condition andresults of operations and future growth prospects could suffer.  If we are unable to successfully introduce new products or fail to keeppace with advances in technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.  We operatein highly competitive and innovative businesses. We need to successfully introduce new products to achieve our strategic business objectives. The development and acquisition of innovative products and technologies that improve efficacy, safety,patients and clinicians ease of use and cost-effectiveness involve significant technical and business risks. The success of new product offerings will depend on many factors, including our ability to properly anticipate and satisfycustomer needs, adapt to new technologies, obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis, demonstrate satisfactory clinical results, manufacture products in an economic and timely manner, and differentiate our products from those of our competitors.If we cannot successfully introduce new products, adapt to changing technologies or anticipate changes in our current and potential customers requirements, our products may become obsolete and our business could suffer. We are subject to a number of existing laws and regulations, non-compliance with which could adversely affect our business, financial condition andresults of operations, and we are susceptible to a changing regulatory environment.  As a participant in the healthcare industry, ouroperations and products, and those of our customers, are regulated by numerous government agencies, both inside and outside the United States. The impact of this on us is direct, to the extent we are subject to these laws and regulations, andindirect in that in a number of situations, even though we may not be directly regulated by specific healthcare laws and regulations, our products must be capable of being used by our customers in a manner that complies with those laws andregulations.  Any new product must undergo lengthy and rigorous testing and other extensive, costly and time-consuming procedures mandated bythe FDA and foreign regulatory authorities. Our facilities must be approved and licensed prior to production and remain subject to inspection from time to time thereafter. Failure to comply with the requirements of the FDA or other regulatoryauthorities, including a failed inspection or a failure in our adverse event reporting system, could result in warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt the manufacture and distribution of products, civilor criminal sanctions, refusal of a government to grant approvals or licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. Any of these actions could cause a loss of customer confidence in us and our products, whichcould adversely affect our sales. In addition, requirements of the FDA and other regulatory authorities are subject to change and compliance with additional requirements may result in product launch delays and otherwise increase our costs. We continue to address a number of regulatory issues as discussed further under the caption entitled Certain Regulatory Mattersin Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In connection with these issues, there can be no assurance that additional costs or civil and criminal penalties will not be incurred, that additional regulatory actions with respect to thecompany will not occur, that the company will not face civil claims for damages from purchasers or users, that substantial additional charges or significant asset impairments may not be required, that sales of other products may not be adverselyaffected, or that additional regulation will not be introduced that may adversely affect the companys operations and consolidated financial statements.   6 The sales and marketing of products and relationships that pharmaceutical and medical device companies havewith healthcare providers are under increasing scrutiny by federal, state and foreign government agencies. The FDA, OIG, DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission have each increased their enforcement efforts (including joint efforts) with respect to theAnti-Kickback Statute, False Claims Act, off-label promotion of products, other healthcare related laws, antitrust and other competition laws. The DOJ also has increased its focus on the enforcement of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act(FCPA), particularly as it relates to the conduct of pharmaceutical companies. Foreign governments have also increased their scrutiny of pharmaceutical companies sales and marketing activities and relationships with healthcare providers. Thelaws and standards governing the promotion, sale and reimbursement of our products and those governing our relationships with healthcare providers and governments can be complicated, are subject to frequent change and may be violated unknowingly. Wehave compliance programs in place, including policies, training and various forms of monitoring, designed to address these risks. Nonetheless, these programs and policies may not always protect us from conduct by individual employees that violatethese laws. Violations, or allegations of violations, of these laws may result in large civil and criminal penalties, debarment from participating in government programs, diversion of management time, attention and resources and may otherwise havean adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For more information related to the Companys ongoing government investigations, please refer to Note 11 in Item 8 of this Annual Report onForm 10-K.  Issues with product quality could have an adverse effect upon our business, subject us to regulatory actions and costlylitigation and cause a loss of customer confidence in us or our products.  Our success depends upon the quality of our products.Quality management plays an essential role in determining and meeting customer requirements, preventing defects, improving the companys products and services and maintaining the integrity of the data that supports the safety and efficacy ofour products. Our future operating results will depend on our ability to maintain and continuously improve our quality management program, that includes an objective and systematic process for monitoring and the evaluation of key effectivenessindicators. While we have one quality system deployed globally that covers the lifecycle of our products, quality and safety issues may occur with respect to any of our products. Unaffiliated third party suppliers provide a number of goods andservices to our R&D, clinical and manufacturing organizations. Third party suppliers are required to comply with our quality standards. Failure of a third party supplier to provide compliant raw materials or supplies could result in delays,service interruptions or other quality related issues that may negatively impact our business results. In addition, some of the raw materials employed in our production processes are derived from human and animal origins, requiring robust controlsto eliminate the potential for introduction of pathogenic agents or other contaminants.  A quality or safety issue could have an adverseeffect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and may result in warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions,refusal of a government to grant approvals and licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. An inability to address a quality or safety issue in an effective and timely manner may also cause negativepublicity, a loss of customer confidence in us or our current or future products, which may result in the loss of sales and difficulty in successfully launching new products.  For more information on regulatory matters currently being addressed by the company, refer to the discussion under the caption entitled Certain Regulatory Matters in Item 7 of this AnnualReport on Form 10-K.  Implementation of the FDA order to recall our COLLEAGUE infusion pumps in the United States may adverselyaffect our business.  Pursuant to the Consent Decree entered into by the company in June 2006, the FDA issued a final order in July2010 regarding the recall of the companys COLLEAGUE infusion pumps currently in use in the United States. The company is executing the recall by offering its customers an option to replace their COLLEAGUE infusion  7 pumps or receive monetary consideration. Under the replacement option, the companys customers may receive the Sigma International General Medical Apparatus, LLC (SIGMA) Spectrum infusionpumps in exchange for their COLLEAGUE infusion pumps. For more information on the COLLEAGUE recall, refer to the discussion under the caption entitled Certain Regulatory Matters in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Thecompany cannot be certain that SIGMA will have sufficient production capacity to meet the demand for SIGMA Spectrum infusion pumps. Customers choosing a refund or for whom sufficient replacement pumps are unavailable are likely to move to acompetitive infusion pump platform. Many of the companys COLLEAGUE customers also purchase a variety of products from the companys Medical Products business. If a significant number of COLLEAGUE customers move to a competitive pumpplatform, our business may suffer and sales of other products in the companys Medical Products portfolio may be adversely affected. In addition, it is possible that substantial additional cash and non-cash charges, including significant assetimpairments related to the COLLEAGUE infusion pumps and related businesses, may be required in future periods based on new information, changes in estimates, the implementation of the recall in the United States, and other actions the company may berequired to undertake in markets outside the United States.  The implementation of healthcare reform in the United States may adverselyaffect our business.  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Act), which was signed into law in March 2010, includes severalprovisions which impact the companys businesses in the United States, including increased Medicaid rebates and an expansion of the 340B Drug Pricing Program which provides certain qualified entities, such as hospitals serving disadvantagedpopulations, with discounts on the purchase of drugs for outpatient use and an excise tax on the sale of certain drugs and medical devices. In 2011, the company became subject to a tax on the sales of its pharmaceutical products to the government.In 2013, the company will be required to pay a 2.3% tax on sales of certain of its medical devices. The impact of the increased Medicaid rebates and the expanded 340B Drug Pricing Program is largely expected to impact the companys BioSciencebusiness, while the additional taxes are expected to impact both of the companys business segments. We may also experience downward pricing pressure as the Act reduces Medicare and Medicaid payments to hospitals. While it is intended to expandhealth insurance coverage and increase access to medical care generally, the long-term impact of the Act on our business and the demand of our products is uncertain. Similarly, we cannot predict the impact of the additional regulations that need tobe established to implement many of the Acts provisions.  If reimbursement for our current or future products is reduced ormodified in the United States or abroad, our business could suffer.  Sales of our products depend, in part, on the extent to which thecosts of our products are paid by health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management organizations, private health coverage insurers and other third-party payors. These healthcare management organizations andthird-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. We may continue to experience continued downward pricing pressures from third-party payors which could result in an adverse effect on our business,financial condition and operational results.  The imposition of austerity measures or other reforms by foreign governments may limit, reduceor eliminate payments for our products and adversely affect both our pricing flexibility and demand for our products. Accordingly, our current and future products may not be considered cost effective, and reimbursement to the consumer may not beavailable or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a competitive basis. Legislation and regulations affecting reimbursement for our products may change at any time and in ways that are difficult to predict and these changes may be adverseto us.  We face substantial competition across each of our product categories. Although no single company competes with us in all of our businesses, we face substantial competition in both of our segments from international anddomestic healthcare and pharmaceutical companies of all sizes. Competition   8 is primarily focused on cost-effectiveness, price, service, product performance, and technological innovation. Competition may increase further as additional companies begin to enter our marketsor modify their existing products to compete directly with ours. If our competitors respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements, our products may be rendered obsolete or non-competitive. If ourcompetitors develop more effective or affordable products, or achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization than we do, our operations will likely be negatively affected. If we are forced to reduce our prices due to increasedcompetition, our business will become less profitable. The companys sales could be adversely affected if any of its contracts with group purchasing organizations, integrated delivery networks or other customers are terminated due to increasedcompetition or otherwise.  We also face competition for marketing, distribution and collaborative development agreements, for establishingrelationships with academic and research institutions, and for licenses to intellectual property. In addition, academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations may also conduct research, seek patentprotection and establish collaborative arrangements for discovery, research, clinical development and marketing of products similar to ours. These companies and institutions compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific andmanagement personnel as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our programs. If we are unable to successfully compete with these companies and institutions, our business may suffer. The nature of producing plasma-based therapies may prevent us from timely responding to market forces and effectively managing our productioncapacity.  The production of plasma-based therapies is a lengthy and complex process. Efforts to increase the collection of plasma orthe production of plasma-based therapies may include the construction and regulatory approval of additional plasma collection facilities and/or plasma fractionation facilities, which can be a lengthy regulatory and capital intensive process. As aresult, our ability to match our collection and production of plasma-based therapies to market demand is imprecise and may result in a failure to meet the market demand for our plasma-based therapies or potentially an oversupply of inventory.Failure to meet market demand for our plasma-based therapies may result in customers transitioning to available competitive products resulting in a loss of segment share or customer confidence. In the event of an oversupply we may be forced to lowerthe prices we charge for some of our plasma-based therapies, close collection and processing facilities, record asset impairment charges or take other action which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we are unable to obtain sufficient components or raw materials on a timely basis or if we experience other manufacturingdifficulties, our business may be adversely affected.  The manufacture of our products requires the timely delivery of sufficientamounts of quality components and materials. We manufacture our products in more than 50 manufacturing facilities around the world. We acquire our components and materials from many suppliers in various countries. While efforts are made to diversifyour sources of components and materials, in certain instances we acquire components and materials from a sole supplier. We work closely with our suppliers to ensure the continuity of supply but we cannot guarantee these efforts will always besuccessful. In addition, due to the regulatory environment in which we operate, we may be unable to quickly establish additional or replacement sources for some components or materials. A reduction or interruption in supply, and an inability todevelop alternative sources for such supply, could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in a timely or cost-effective manner, and our ability to make product sales.  Many of our products are difficult to manufacture. This is due to the complex nature of manufacturing pharmaceuticals, including biologics, and devices, as well as the strict regulatory regime governingour manufacturing operations. Variations in the manufacturing process may result in production failures which could lead to launch delays, product shortage, unanticipated costs, lost revenues and damage to our reputation.  9 A failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior to the release of products to our customers may also result in warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary sanctions,injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a government to grant approvals or licenses, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of existing approvals or licenses. Several of our products are manufactured at a single manufacturing facility. Loss or damage to a manufacturing facility due to a natural disaster orotherwise could adversely affect our ability to manufacture sufficient quantities of key products to meet customer demand or contractual requirements which may result in a loss of revenue and other adverse business consequences. Because of the timerequired to approve and license a manufacturing facility a third party manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis to replace production capacity in the event we lose manufacturing capacity due to natural disaster, regulatory action orotherwise.  If we are unable to protect our patents or other proprietary rights, or if we infringe the patents or other proprietaryrights of others, our competitiveness and business prospects may be materially damaged.  Patent and other proprietary rights areessential to our business. Our success depends to a significant degree on our ability to obtain and enforce patents and licenses to patent rights, both in the United States and in other countries. We cannot guarantee that pending patent applicationswill result in issued patents, that patents issued or licensed will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, that our patents will not be found to be invalid or that the intellectual property rights of others will not prevent the companyfrom selling certain products or including key features in the companys products.  The patent position of a healthcare company is oftenuncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. Significant litigation concerning patents and products is pervasive in our industry. Patent claims include challenges to the coverage and validity of our patents on products or processes aswell as allegations that our products infringe patents held by competitors or other third parties. A loss in any of these types of cases could result in a loss of patent protection or the ability to market products, which could lead to a significantloss of sales, or otherwise materially affect future results of operations.  We also rely on trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets andknow-how to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive positions. While we protect our proprietary rights to the extent possible, we cannot guarantee that third parties will not know, discover or independently develop equivalent proprietaryinformation or techniques, or that they will not gain access to our trade secrets or disclose our trade secrets to the public. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that we can maintain and protect unpatented proprietary information and trade secrets.Misappropriation or other loss of our intellectual property would have an adverse effect on our competitive position and may cause us to incur substantial litigation costs.  If our business development activities are unsuccessful, our business could suffer and our financial performance could be adversely affected. As part of our long-term growth strategy, we are engaged in business development activities including evaluating acquisitions, joint developmentopportunities, technology licensing arrangements and other opportunities. These activities may result in substantial investment of the companys resources. Our success developing products or expanding into new markets from such activities willdepend on a number of factors, including our ability to find suitable opportunities for acquisition, investment or alliance; whether we are able to complete an acquisition, investment or alliance on terms that are satisfactory to us; the strength ofthe other companys underlying technology, products and ability to execute its business strategies; any intellectual property and litigation related to these products or technology; and our ability to successfully integrate the acquiredcompany, business, product, technology or research into our existing operations, including the ability to adequately fund acquired in-process research and development projects. If we are unsuccessful in our business development activities, we may beunable to meet our financial targets and our financial performance could be adversely affected.   10 We are subject to risks associated with doing business globally. Our operations, both inside and outside the United States, are subject to risks inherent in conducting business globally and under the laws, regulationsand customs of various jurisdictions and geographies. These risks include fluctuations in currency exchange rates, changes in exchange controls, loss of business in government and public tenders that are held annually in many cases, nationalization,increasingly complex labor environments, expropriation and other governmental actions, availability of raw materials, changes in taxation, importation limitations, export control restrictions, changes in or violations of U.S. or local laws,including the FCPA, dependence on a few government entities as customers, pricing restrictions, economic and political instability, disputes between countries, diminished or insufficient protection of intellectual property, and disruption ordestruction of operations in a significant geographic region regardless of cause, including war, terrorism, riot, civil insurrection or social unrest. Failure to comply with, or material changes to, the laws and regulations that affect our globaloperations could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.  We are subject to foreigncurrency exchange risk.  In 2011, we generated approximately 60% of our revenue outside the United States. We anticipate that revenuefrom outside the United States will continue to be significant. As a result, our financial results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Market volatility and currency fluctuations may limit our ability tocost-effectively hedge against our foreign currency exposure and, in addition, there are limitations in our ability to hedge our exposure to currency fluctuations in certain emerging markets. Governments may impose currency restrictions limiting ourability to manage our foreign currency exposure. We cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange rates or the degree to which we can mitigate these risks. A discussion of the financial impact of foreign exchange ratefluctuations, and the ways and extent to which we attempt to mitigate such impact, including the impact of restrictions on currency exchange imposed by the Venezuelan government, is contained under the caption Financial Instrument MarketRisk in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  Changes in tax laws or exposure to additional income tax liabilitiesmay have a negative impact on our operating results.  Tax policy reform continues to be a topic of discussion in the United States.

We may experience difficulties implementing our new global enterprise resource planning system. We are engaged in a multi-year implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning system (ERP). The ERP is designed to accurately maintain thecompanys books and records and provide information to the companys management team important to the operation of the business. The companys ERP has required, and will continue to require, the investment of significant human andfinancial resources. We may not be able to successfully implement the ERP without experiencing significant delays, increased costs and other difficulties. Any significant disruption or deficiency in the design and implementation of the ERP couldadversely affect our ability to process orders, ship product, send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business. While we have invested significant resources in planning and project management, thereis no assurance that a significant implementation issue will not arise.   11 We are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure. We increasingly rely upon technology systems and infrastructure. Our technology systems are potentially vulnerable to breakdown orother interruption by fire, power loss, system malfunction, unauthorized access and other events.

If we cannot effectively recruit and retain qualified employees, our business could suffer. We are subject to a number of pending lawsuits.  We are a defendant in a number of pending lawsuits, including with respect to patent and product liability matters. In addition, we may be named as a defendant in future patent, product liability or otherlawsuits. These current and future matters may result in reduced sales, significant liabilities and diversion of our managements time, attention and resources. Given the uncertain nature of litigation generally, we are not able in all cases toestimate the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in these current matters. In view of these uncertainties, we cannot assure that the outcome of these matters will not result in charges in excess of any establishedreserves, and, to the extent available, liability insurance. We also continue to be self-insured with respect to product liability claims. The absence of third-party insurance coverage for current or future claims increases our potential exposure tounanticipated claims and adverse decisions. Protracted litigation, including any adverse outcomes, may have an adverse impact on the business, operations or financial condition of the company. Even claims without merit could subject us to adversepublicity and require us to incur significant legal fees. See Note 11 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information regarding current lawsuits.  Current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect our business and financial condition.  The companys ability to generate cash flows from operations could be affected if there is a material decline in the demand for the companys products, in the solvency of its customers orsuppliers, or deterioration in the companys key financial ratios or credit ratings. Current or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect our business and the ability of our customers (including governments), to pay for our productsand services, and the amount spent on healthcare generally. This could result in a decrease in the demand for our products and services, declining cash flows, longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition.These conditions may also adversely affect certain of our suppliers, which could cause a disruption in our ability to produce our products. We continue to do business with foreign governments in certain countries, including Greece, Spain, Portugaland Italy, that have experienced a deterioration in credit and economic conditions. As of December 31, 2011, the companys net accounts receivable from the public sector in Greece, Spain, Portugal and Italy totaled $524 million. The globaleconomic conditions and governmental actions in these and other countries may continue to result in delays in the collection of receivables and require us to re-evaluate the collectibility and valuation of our receivables which could result inadditional credit losses. These conditions may also impact the stability of the Euro. For more information on accounts receivable and credit matters with respect to certain of these countries, refer to the discussion under the caption entitledCredit Facilities, Access to Capital and Credit Ratings in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.   12"
6,BAX,BAXTER INTERNATIONAL INC,2011-02-23,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors.     In addition to the other information in this Annual Report on    Form 10-K,    shareholders or prospective investors should carefully consider    the following risk factors. If any of the events described below    occurs, our business, financial condition and results of    operations and future growth prospects could suffer. If we    are unable to successfully introduce new products or fail to    keep pace with advances in technology, our business, financial    condition and results of operations could be adversely    affected.     The successful and timely implementation of our business model    depends on our ability to adapt to changing technologies and    introduce new products. As our competitors will continue to    introduce competitive products, the development and acquisition    of innovative products and technologies that improve efficacy,    safety, patients and clinicians ease of use and    cost-effectiveness are important to our success. The success of    new product offerings will depend on many factors, including our    ability to properly anticipate and satisfy customer needs,    obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis, develop and    manufacture products in an economic and timely manner, obtain or    maintain advantageous positions with respect to intellectual    property, and differentiate our products from those of our    competitors. Failure by us to introduce planned products or    other new products or to introduce products on schedule could    have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and    results of operations.     The development and acquisition of innovative products and    technologies that improve efficacy, safety, patients and    clinicians ease of use and cost-effectiveness involve    significant technical and business risks. If we cannot adapt to    changing technologies or anticipate changes in our current and    potential customers requirements our products may become    obsolete, and our business could suffer. Our success will    depend, in part, on our ability to continue to enhance our    existing products, develop new technology that addresses the    increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our prospective    customers, license or acquire leading technologies and respond    to technological advances and emerging industry standards and    practices on a timely and cost-effective basis. We are    subject to a number of existing laws and regulations,    non-compliance with which could adversely affect our business,    financial condition and results of operations, and we are    susceptible to a changing regulatory environment.     As a participant in the healthcare industry, our operations and    products, and those of our customers, are regulated by numerous    government agencies, both inside and outside the United States.    The impact of this on us is direct, to the extent we are subject    to these laws and regulations, and indirect in that in a number    of situations, even though we may not be directly regulated by    specific healthcare laws and regulations, our products must be    capable of being used by our customers in a manner that complies    with those laws and regulations.     The manufacture, distribution, marketing and use of our products    are subject to extensive regulation and increasing scrutiny by    the FDA and other regulatory authorities both inside and outside    the United States. Any new product must undergo lengthy and    rigorous testing and other extensive, costly and time-consuming    procedures mandated by the FDA and foreign regulatory    authorities. Our facilities must be approved and licensed prior    to production and remain subject to inspection from time to time    thereafter. Failure to comply with the requirements of the FDA    or other regulatory authorities, including a failed inspection    or a failure in our adverse event reporting system, could result    in warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary    sanctions, injunctions to halt the manufacture and distribution    of products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a    government to grant approvals or licenses, restrictions on    operations or withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. Any    of these actions could cause a loss of customer confidence in us    and our products, which could adversely affect our sales.     We continue to address a number of regulatory issues as    discussed further under the caption entitled Certain    Regulatory Matters in Item 7 of this Annual Report on    Form 10-K.    In connection with these issues, there can be no assurance that    additional costs or civil and criminal penalties will not be    incurred, that additional regulatory actions with respect to the    company will not occur, that the company will not face civil    claims for    6     damages from purchasers or users, that substantial additional    charges or significant asset impairments may not be required,    that sales of other products may not be adversely affected, or    that additional regulation will not be introduced that may    adversely affect the companys operations and consolidated    financial statements.     The sales and marketing of our products and our relationships    with healthcare providers are under increasing scrutiny by    federal, state and foreign government agencies. The FDA, the    OIG, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal    Trade Commission have each increased their enforcement efforts    (including joint efforts) with respect to the Anti-Kickback    Statute, False Claims Act, off-label promotion of products,    other healthcare related laws, antitrust and other competition    laws. The DOJ also has increased its focus on the enforcement of    the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), particularly    as it relates to the conduct of pharmaceutical companies. The    FCPA prohibits certain individuals and entities, including the    company, from promising, offering, or giving anything of value    to foreign officials with the intent of influencing the foreign    official for the purpose of helping the company obtain or retain    business or gain an improper advantage. Outside of the United    States, our business involves significant interaction with    foreign officials. The FCPA also imposes recordkeeping and    internal controls requirements on the company. Foreign    governments have also increased their scrutiny of pharmaceutical    companies sales and marketing activities and relationships    with healthcare providers. The laws and standards governing the    promotion, sale and reimbursement of our products and those    governing our relationships with healthcare providers and    governments can be complicated, are subject to frequent change    and may be violated unknowingly. We have compliance programs in    place, including policies, training and various forms of    monitoring, designed to address these risks. Nonetheless, these    programs and policies may not always protect us from conduct by    our employees that violate these laws. Violations, or    allegations of violations, of these laws may result in large    civil and criminal penalties, debarment from participating in    government programs, diversion of management time, attention and    resources and may otherwise have an adverse effect on our    business, financial condition and results of operations. Refer    to Note 11 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on    Form 10-K    for a discussion of the requests that the company received in    2010 from certain federal government agencies. Issues    with product quality could have an adverse effect upon our    business, subject us to regulatory actions and costly litigation    and cause a loss of customer confidence in us or our    products.     Our success depends upon the quality of our products. Quality    management plays an essential role in determining and meeting    customer requirements, preventing defects, improving the    companys products and services and maintaining the    integrity of the data that supports the safety and efficacy of    our products. Our future operating results will depend on our    ability to implement and improve our quality management program,    and effectively train and manage our employee base with respect    to quality management. While we have a network of quality    systems throughout our business units and facilities that relate    to the design, development, manufacturing, packaging,    sterilization, handling, distribution and labeling of our    products, quality and safety issues may occur with respect to    any of our products. In addition, some of the raw materials    employed in our production processes are derived from human and    animal origins. Though great care is taken to assure the safety    of these raw materials, the nature of their origin elevates the    potential for the introduction of pathogenic agents or other    contaminants.     A quality or safety issue could have an adverse effect on our    business, financial condition and results of operations and may    result in warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary    sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of    products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a government    to grant approvals and licenses, restrictions on operations or    withdrawal of existing approvals and licenses. An inability to    address a quality or safety issue in an effective and timely    manner may also cause negative publicity, a loss of customer    confidence in us or our current or future products, which may    result in the loss of sales and difficulty in successfully    launching new products. In addition, we may be named as a    defendant in product liability or other lawsuits, which could    result in costly litigation, reduced sales, significant    liabilities and diversion of our managements time,    attention and resources. We continue to be self-insured with    respect to product liability claims. The absence of third-party    insurance coverage for such claims increases our potential    exposure to unanticipated claims and adverse decisions. Even    claims without merit could subject us to adverse publicity and    require us to incur significant legal fees.    7     For more information on regulatory matters currently being    addressed by the company, refer to the discussion under the    caption entitled Certain Regulatory Matters in    Item 7 of this Annual Report on    Form 10-K. Implementation    of the FDA order to recall our COLLEAGUE infusion pumps in the    United States may adversely affect our business.     Pursuant to the Consent Decree entered into by the company in    June 2006, the FDA issued a final order in July 2010 regarding    the recall of the companys COLLEAGUE infusion pumps    currently in use in the United States. The company is executing    the recall over the two years following the final order by    offering its customers an option to replace their COLLEAGUE    infusion pumps or receive monetary consideration. Under the    replacement option, the companys customers may receive the    Sigma International General Medical Apparatus, LLC (SIGMA)    Spectrum infusion pumps in exchange for their COLLEAGUE infusion    pumps. For more information on the COLLEAGUE recall, refer to    the discussion under the caption entitled Certain    Regulatory Matters in Item 7 of this Annual Report on    Form 10-K.    The company cannot be certain that SIGMA will have sufficient    production capacity to meet the demand for SIGMA Spectrum    infusion pumps. Customers choosing a refund or for whom    sufficient replacement pumps are unavailable are likely to move    to a competitive infusion pump platform. Many of the    companys COLLEAGUE customers also purchase a variety of    the companys other Medication Delivery products. If a    significant number of COLLEAGUE customers move to a competitive    pump platform, our business may suffer and sales of other    products in the companys Medication Delivery product    portfolio may be adversely affected. In addition, it is possible    that substantial additional cash and non-cash charges, including    significant asset impairments related to the COLLEAGUE infusion    pumps and related businesses, may be required in future periods    based on new information, changes in estimates, the    implementation of the recall in the United States, and other    actions the company may be required to undertake in markets    outside the United States. The    implementation of healthcare reform in the United States may    adversely affect our business.     The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Act), which was    signed into law in March 2010, includes several provisions which    impact the companys businesses in the United States,    including increased Medicaid rebates and an expansion of the    340B Drug Pricing Program which provides certain qualified    entities, such as hospitals serving disadvantaged populations,    with discounts on the purchase of drugs for outpatient use and    an excise tax on the sale of certain drugs and medical devices.    The company will also be required to pay a tax on the sales of    its pharmaceutical products to the government beginning in 2011    and a 2.3% tax on certain of its medical devices beginning in    2013. The impact of the increased Medicaid rebates and the    expanded 340B Drug Pricing Program is largely expected to impact    the companys Bioscience business, while the additional    taxes are expected to impact each of the companys business    segments. We may also experience downward pricing pressure as    the Act reduces Medicare and Medicaid payments to hospitals.    While it is intended to expand health insurance coverage and    increase access to medical care generally, additional    regulations need to be established to implement many of the    Acts provisions. As a result, the full impact of the Act    is uncertain. If    reimbursement for our current or future products is reduced or    modified, our business could suffer.     Sales of our products depend, in part, on the extent to which    the costs of our products are paid by health maintenance,    managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management    organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration    authorities, private health coverage insurers and other    third-party payors. These healthcare management organizations    and third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices    charged for medical products and services. Additionally, as    discussed above, the containment of healthcare costs has become    a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of    drugs and other healthcare products have been targeted in this    effort. We also face challenges, including austerity measures    being taken by governments, in certain foreign markets where the    pricing and profitability of our products generally are subject    to government controls. Government controls in foreign markets    also impact our ability to collect accounts receivable in a    timely manner. Accordingly, our current and potential products    may not be considered cost effective, and reimbursement to the    consumer may not be available or sufficient to allow us to    8     sell our products on a competitive basis. Legislation and    regulations affecting reimbursement for our products may change    at any time and in ways that are difficult to predict and these    changes may be adverse to us. Further reductions in Medicare,    Medicaid or other third-party payor reimbursements could have a    negative effect on our operating results. Consolidation    in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business,    financial condition and results of operations.     There has been consolidation in our customer base, and by our    competitors, which has resulted in pricing and sales pressures.    As these consolidations occur, competition to provide products    like ours will become more intense, and the importance of    establishing relationships with key industry participants    including GPOs, IDNs and other customers will become greater.    Customers will continue to work and organize to negotiate price    reductions for our products and services. To the extent we are    forced to reduce our prices, our business will become less    profitable unless we are able to achieve corresponding    reductions in costs. The companys sales could be adversely    affected if any of its contracts with its GPOs, IDNs or other    customers are terminated in part or in their entirety, or    members decide to purchase from another supplier. We    face substantial competition and many of our competitors have    significantly greater financial and other    resources.     Although no single company competes with us in all of our    businesses, we face substantial competition in each of our    segments from international and domestic healthcare and    pharmaceutical companies of all sizes. Competition is primarily    focused on cost-effectiveness, price, service, product    performance, and technological innovation. Some competitors,    principally large pharmaceutical companies, have greater    financial, R&D and marketing resources than us. Competition    may increase further as additional companies begin to enter our    markets or modify their existing products to compete directly    with ours. Greater financial, R&D and marketing resources    may allow our competitors to respond more quickly to new or    emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements that    may render our products obsolete or non-competitive. If our    competitors develop more effective or affordable products, or    achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization    than we do, our operations will likely be negatively affected.     We also face competition for marketing, distribution and    collaborative development agreements, for establishing    relationships with academic and research institutions, and for    licenses to intellectual property. In addition, academic    institutions, government agencies and other public and private    research organizations may also conduct research, seek patent    protection and establish collaborative arrangements for    discovery, research, clinical development and marketing of    products similar to ours. These companies and institutions    compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific    and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies    complementary to our programs. If we are unable to successfully    compete with these companies and institutions, our business may    suffer. The    nature of producing plasma-based products may prevent us from    timely responding to market forces and effectively managing our    production capacity.     The production of plasma-based products is a lengthy and complex    process. Efforts to increase the collection of plasma may    include the construction and regulatory approval of additional    plasma collection facilities, which can be a lengthy regulatory    and capital intensive process. As a result, our ability to match    our collection and production of plasma-based products to market    demand is imprecise and may result in a failure to meet the    market demand of our plasma-based products or potentially an    oversupply of inventory. Failure to meet market demand for our    plasma-based products may result in customers transitioning to    available competitive products resulting in a loss of segment    share. In the event of an oversupply we may be forced to lower    the prices we charge for some of our plasma-based products,    close collection and processing facilities, record asset    impairment charges or take other action which may adversely    affect our business, financial condition and results of    operations.    9 If we    are unable to obtain sufficient components or raw materials on a    timely basis or if we experience other manufacturing    difficulties, our business may be adversely    affected.     The manufacture of our products requires the timely delivery of    sufficient amounts of quality components and materials. We    manufacture our products in over 50 manufacturing facilities    around the world. We acquire our components and materials from    many suppliers in various countries. While efforts are made to    diversify our sources of components and materials, in certain    instances we acquire components and materials from a sole    supplier. We work closely with our suppliers to ensure the    continuity of supply but we cannot guarantee these efforts will    continue to be successful. In addition, due to the regulatory    environment in which we operate, we may be unable to quickly    establish additional or replacement sources for some components    or materials. A reduction or interruption in supply, and an    inability to develop alternative sources for such supply, could    adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in a    timely or cost-effective manner, and our ability to make product    sales.     Many of our products are difficult to manufacture. This is due    to the complex nature of manufacturing pharmaceuticals,    including biologics, and devices as well as the strict    regulatory regime governing our manufacturing operations.    Variations in the manufacturing process may result in production    failures which could lead to launch delays, product shortage,    unanticipated costs, lost revenues and damage to our reputation.    A failure to identify and address manufacturing problems prior    to the release of products to our customers may also result in    warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary    sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of    products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a government    to grant approvals or licenses, restrictions on operations or    withdrawal of existing approvals or licenses.     Some of our manufacturing facilities are located in areas that    are subject to hurricanes, earthquakes or other natural    disasters. Loss or damage to a manufacturing facility could    adversely affect our ability to manufacture sufficient    quantities of key products to meet customer demand or    contractual requirements which may result in a loss of revenue    and other adverse business consequences. Because of the time    required to approve and license a manufacturing facility a third    party manufacturer may not be available on a timely basis to    replace production capacity in the event we lose manufacturing    capacity due to natural disaster, regulatory action or otherwise. If we    are unable to protect our patents or other proprietary rights,    or if we infringe the patents or other proprietary rights of    others, our competitiveness and business prospects may be    materially damaged.     Patent and other proprietary rights are essential to our    business. Our success depends to a significant degree on our    ability to obtain and enforce patents and licenses to patent    rights, both in the United States and in other countries. We    cannot guarantee that pending patent applications will result in    issued patents, that patents issued or licensed will not be    challenged or circumvented by competitors, that our patents will    not be found to be invalid or that the intellectual property    rights of others will not prevent the company from selling    certain products or including key features in the companys    products.     The patent position of a healthcare company is often uncertain    and involves complex legal and factual questions. Significant    litigation concerning patents and products is pervasive in our    industry. Patent claims include challenges to the coverage and    validity of our patents on products or processes as well as    allegations that our products infringe patents held by    competitors or other third parties. A loss in any of these types    of cases could result in a loss of patent protection or the    ability to market products, which could lead to a significant    loss of sales, or otherwise materially affect future results of    operations.     We also rely on trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and    know-how to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive    positions. While we protect our proprietary rights to the extent    possible, we cannot guarantee that third parties will not know,    discover or independently develop equivalent proprietary    information or techniques, or that they will not gain access to    our trade secrets or disclose our trade secrets to the public.    Therefore, we cannot guarantee that we can maintain and protect    unpatented proprietary information and trade secrets.    Misappropriation or other loss of our intellectual property    would have an adverse effect on our competitive position and may    cause us to incur substantial litigation costs.    10 If our    business development activities are unsuccessful, our business    could suffer and our financial performance could be adversely    affected.     As part of our long-term growth strategy, we are engaged in    business development activities including evaluating    acquisitions, joint development opportunities, technology    licensing arrangements and other opportunities. These activities    may result in substantial investment of the companys    resources. Our success developing products or expanding into new    markets from such activities will depend on a number of factors,    including our ability to find suitable opportunities for    acquisition, investment or alliance; whether we are able to    complete an acquisition, investment or alliance on terms that    are satisfactory to us; the strength of the other companys    underlying technology, products and ability to execute its    business strategies; any intellectual property and litigation    related to these products or technology; and our ability to    successfully integrate the acquired company, business, product,    technology or research into our existing operations, including    the ability to adequately fund acquired in-process research and    development projects. If we are unsuccessful in our business    development activities, we may be unable to meet our financial    targets and our financial performance could be adversely    affected. If we    are unsuccessful in identifying growth opportunities or exiting    low margin businesses or discontinuing low profit products, our    business, financial condition and results could be adversely    affected.     Successful execution of our business strategy depends, in part,    on improving the profit margins we earn with respect to our    current and future products. A failure to identify and take    advantage of opportunities that allow us to increase our profit    margins or a failure by us to exit low profit margin businesses    or discontinue low profit margin products, may result in us    failing to meet our financial targets and may otherwise have an    adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results    of operations. We are    subject to risks associated with doing business    globally.     Our operations, both inside and outside the United States, are    subject to risks inherent in conducting business globally and    under the laws, regulations and customs of various jurisdictions    and geographies. These risks include fluctuations in currency    exchange rates, changes in exchange controls, loss of business    in government and public tenders that are held annually in many    cases, nationalization, increasingly complex labor environments,    expropriation and other governmental actions, availability of    raw materials, changes in taxation, including legislative    changes in United States and international taxation of income    earned outside of the United States, importation limitations,    export control restrictions, changes in or violations of    U.S. or local laws, including the FCPA, dependence on a few    government entities as customers, pricing restrictions, economic    and political instability, disputes between countries,    diminished or insufficient protection of intellectual property,    disruption or destruction of operations in a significant    geographic region  due to the location of    manufacturing facilities, distribution facilities or    customers  regardless of cause, including war,    terrorism, riot, civil insurrection or social unrest, or natural    or man-made disasters, including famine, flood, fire,    earthquake, storm or disease. Failure to comply with the laws    and regulations that affect our global operations could have an    adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results    of operations. We are    subject to foreign currency exchange risk.     In 2010, we generated approximately 60% of our revenue outside    the United States. We anticipate that revenue from outside the    United States will continue to be significant. As a result, our    financial results may continue to be adversely affected by    fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Market    volatility and currency fluctuations may also reduce the    benefits from our natural hedges and limit our ability to    cost-effectively hedge against our foreign currency exposure.    Governments may impose currency restrictions restricting our    ability to manage our foreign currency exposure. We cannot    predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency exchange    rates or the degree to which we can mitigate these risks. A    discussion of the financial impact of foreign exchange rate    fluctuations, and the ways and extent to which we attempt to    mitigate such impact, including the impact of restrictions on    currency exchange imposed by the Venezuelan government, is    contained under the heading Financial Instrument Market    Risk in Item 7 of this Annual Report on    Form 10-K.    11 We may    experience difficulties implementing our new global enterprise    resource planning system.     We are engaged in a multi-year implementation of a new global    enterprise resource planning system (ERP). The ERP is designed    to accurately maintain the companys books and records and    provide information to the companys management team    important to the operation of the business. The companys    ERP has required, and will continue to require, the investment    of significant human and financial resources. We may not be able    to successfully implement the ERP without experiencing delays,    increased costs and other difficulties. Any significant    disruption or deficiency in the design and implementation of the    ERP could adversely affect our ability to process orders, ship    product, send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual    obligations or otherwise operate our business. We are    subject to a number of pending lawsuits.     We are a defendant in a number of pending lawsuits, including    with respect to patent and product liability matters, and could    be subject to additional lawsuits in the future. See    Note 11 in Item 8 of this Annual Report on    Form 10-K    for more information regarding these lawsuits. Given the    uncertain nature of litigation generally, we are not able in all    cases to estimate the amount or range of loss that could result    from an unfavorable outcome of the litigation to which we are a    party. In view of these uncertainties, we cannot assure that the    outcome of these matters will not result in charges in excess of    any established reserves, and, to the extent available,    liability insurance. Protracted litigation, including any    adverse outcomes, may have an adverse impact on the business,    operations or financial condition of the company. Current    or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect our    business and financial condition.     The companys ability to generate cash flows from    operations could be affected if there is a material decline in    the demand for the companys products, in the solvency of    its customers or suppliers, or deterioration in the    companys key financial ratios or credit ratings. Current    or worsening economic conditions may adversely affect our    business and the business of our customers, including their    ability to pay for our products and services, and the amount    spent on healthcare generally. This could result in a decrease    in the demand for our products and services, declining cash    flows, longer sales cycles, slower adoption of new technologies    and increased price competition. These conditions may also    adversely affect certain of our suppliers, which could cause a    disruption in our ability to produce our products. "
10,BAX,BAXTER INTERNATIONAL INC,2010-02-23,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors.     In addition to the other information in this Annual Report on    Form 10-K,    shareholders or prospective investors should carefully consider    the following risk factors. If any of the events described below    occurs, our business, financial condition and results of    operations and future growth prospects could suffer. If we    are unable to successfully introduce new products or fail to    keep pace with advances in technology, our business, financial    condition and results of operations could be adversely    affected.     The successful and timely implementation of our business model    depends on our ability to adapt to changing technologies and    introduce new products. As our competitors will continue to    introduce competitive products, the development and acquisition    of innovative products and technologies that improve efficacy,    safety, patients and clinicians ease of use and    cost-effectiveness are important to our success. The success of    new product offerings will depend on many factors, including our    ability to properly anticipate and satisfy    5     customer needs, obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis,    develop and manufacture products in an economic and timely    manner, obtain    and/or    maintain advantageous positions with respect to intellectual    property, and differentiate our products from those of our    competitors. Failure by us to introduce planned products or    other new products or to introduce products on schedule could    have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and    results of operations.     The development and acquisition of innovative products and    technologies that improve efficacy, safety, patients and    clinicians ease of use and cost-effectiveness involve    significant technical and business risks. If we cannot adapt to    changing technologies or anticipate changes in our current and    potential customers requirements our products may become    obsolete, and our business could suffer. Our success will    depend, in part, on our ability to continue to enhance our    existing products, develop new technology that addresses the    increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our prospective    customers, license or acquire leading technologies and respond    to technological advances and emerging industry standards and    practices on a timely and cost-effective basis. We are    subject to a number of existing laws and regulations,    non-compliance with which could adversely affect our business,    financial condition and results of operations, and we are    susceptible to a changing regulatory environment.     As a participant in the healthcare industry, our operations and    products, and those of our customers, are regulated by numerous    government agencies, both inside and outside the United States.    The impact of this on us is direct, to the extent we are subject    to these laws and regulations, and indirect in that in a number    of situations, even though we may not be directly regulated by    specific healthcare laws and regulations, our products must be    capable of being used by our customers in a manner that complies    with those laws and regulations.     The manufacture, distribution, marketing and use of our products    are subject to extensive regulation and increasing scrutiny by    the FDA and other regulatory authorities both inside and outside    the United States. Any new product must undergo lengthy and    rigorous testing and other extensive, costly and time-consuming    procedures mandated by the FDA and foreign regulatory    authorities. We may elect to delay or cancel our anticipated    regulatory submissions for new indications for our current or    proposed new products for a number of reasons. Failure to comply    with the requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities    could result in warning letters, product recalls or seizures,    monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt the manufacture and    distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal    of a government to grant approvals, restrictions on operations    or withdrawal of existing approvals. Any of these actions could    cause a loss of customer confidence in us and our products,    which could adversely affect our sales.     We continue to address a number of regulatory issues as    discussed further under the caption entitled Certain    Regulatory Matters in Item 7 of this Annual Report on    Form 10-K.    In connection with these issues, there can be no assurance that    additional costs or civil and criminal penalties will not be    incurred, that additional regulatory actions with respect to the    company will not occur, that substantial additional charges or    significant asset impairments may not be required, or that    additional legislation or regulation will not be introduced that    may adversely affect the companys operations. Third    parties may also file claims against us in connection with these    issues. In addition, sales of the related products may continue    to be affected and sales of other Baxter products may be    adversely affected if we do not adequately address these issues.     The sales and marketing of our products and our relationships    with healthcare providers are under increasing scrutiny by    federal, state and foreign government agencies. The FDA, the    OIG, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Trade    Commission have each increased their enforcement efforts with    respect to the anti-kickback statute, False Claims Act,    off-label promotion of products, other healthcare related laws,    antitrust and other competition laws. The DOJ has announced an    increased focus on the enforcement of the U.S. Foreign    Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) particularly as it relates to the    conduct of pharmaceutical companies. Foreign governments have    also increased their scrutiny of pharmaceutical companies    sales and marketing activities and relationships with healthcare    providers. The laws and standards governing the promotion, sale    and reimbursement of our products and those governing our    relationships with healthcare    6     providers and governments can be complicated, are subject to    frequent change and may be violated unknowingly. We have    compliance programs in place, including policies, training and    various forms of monitoring designed to address these risks.    Nonetheless, these programs and policies may not always protect    us from conduct by our employees that violate these laws.    Violations, or allegations of violations, of these laws may    result in large civil and criminal penalties, debarment from    participating in government programs, diversion of management    time, attention and resources and may otherwise have an adverse    effect on our business, financial condition and results of    operations. Issues    with product quality could have an adverse effect on our    business and subject us to regulatory actions and costly    litigation.     Quality management plays an essential role in determining and    meeting customer requirements, preventing defects and improving    the companys products and services. Our future operating    results will depend on our ability to implement and improve our    quality management program, and effectively train and manage our    employee base with respect to quality management. While we have    a network of quality systems throughout our business units and    facilities that relate to the design, development,    manufacturing, packaging, sterilization, handling, distribution    and labeling of our products, quality and safety issues may    occur with respect to any of our products. In addition, some of    the raw materials employed in our production processes are    derived from human and animal origins. Though great care is    taken to assure the safety of these raw materials, the nature of    their origin elevates the potential for the introduction of    pathogenic agents or other contaminants.     A quality or safety issue could have an adverse effect on our    business, financial condition and results of operations and may    result in warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary    sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of    products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a government    to grant approvals, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of    existing approvals. An inability to address a quality or safety    issue in an effective manner on a timely basis may also cause a    loss of customer confidence in us or our products, which may    result in the loss of sales. In addition, we may be named as a    defendant in product liability or other lawsuits, which could    result in costly litigation, reduced sales, significant    liabilities and diversion of our managements time,    attention and resources. We continue to be self-insured with    respect to product liability claims. The absence of third-party    insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to    unanticipated claims and adverse decisions. Even claims without    merit could subject us to adverse publicity and require us to    incur significant legal fees.     For more information on certain regulatory matters currently    being addressed by the company with the FDA, please refer to    Certain Regulatory Matters in Item 7 of this    Annual Report on    Form 10-K. Changes    in the healthcare regulatory environment, including the pending    healthcare reform being contemplated by the United States    Congress, may adversely affect our business.     Changes currently being contemplated in healthcare regulatory    environments worldwide may restrict our operations or our    growth. Congress is currently debating reforming the current    healthcare system in the United States and the laws and    regulations that will determine how that reform may be    implemented. Some of the laws currently under debate may    adversely affect the revenue generated by our products    and/or the    taxes we pay. These taxes may include a tax related to the sales    (or market share) of our medical devices and drugs. Because each    of our business units sell medical devices and drugs it is    expected that each would be impacted by these proposed taxes. In    addition to possible increases in taxes, there is a provision    currently under consideration which is intended to expand the    use of the 340B Drug Discount Program. The 340B    program provides certain qualified entities, such as hospitals    serving disadvantaged populations, with discounts on the    purchases of drugs for outpatient use. It has been proposed that    eligibility for these discounts be expanded to other entities    and to the purchase of drugs for inpatient use. These additional    taxes and compulsory discounts, if enacted, may adversely affect    our business by decreasing revenues and profits, diminishing our    ability to generate sufficient capital available for R&D    and forcing us to discontinue products that cannot support the    increased tax or discount burden.    7     None of the legislation described above has been enacted. We are    unable to predict with any degree of certainty what, if any,    legislation will be enacted and if so what impact such    legislation will ultimately have on our business. If    reimbursement for our current or future products is reduced or    modified, our business could suffer.     Sales of our products depend, in part, on the extent to which    the costs of our products are paid by health maintenance,    managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management    organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration    authorities, private health coverage insurers and other    third-party payors. These healthcare management organizations    and third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices    charged for medical products and services. Additionally, as    discussed above, the containment of healthcare costs has become    a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of    drugs and other healthcare products have been targeted in this    effort. We also face challenges in certain foreign markets where    the pricing and profitability of our products generally are    subject to government controls. Government controls in foreign    markets also impact our ability to collect accounts receivable    in a timely manner. Accordingly, our current and potential    products may not be considered cost effective, and reimbursement    to the consumer may not be available or sufficient to allow us    to sell our products on a competitive basis. Legislation and    regulations affecting reimbursement for our products may change    at any time and in ways that are difficult to predict and these    changes may be adverse to us. Any reduction in Medicare,    Medicaid or other third-party payor reimbursements could have a    negative effect on our operating results. Consolidation    in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business,    financial condition and results of operations.     There has been consolidation in our customer base, and by our    competitors, which has resulted in pricing and sales pressures.    As these consolidations occur, competition to provide products    like ours will become more intense, and the importance of    establishing relationships with key industry participants    including GPOs, IDNs and other customers will become greater.    Customers will continue to work and organize to negotiate price    reductions for our products and services. To the extent we are    forced to reduce our prices, our business will become less    profitable unless we are able to achieve corresponding    reductions in costs. The companys sales could be adversely    affected if any of its contracts with its GPOs, IDNs or other    customers are terminated in part or in their entirety, or    members decide to purchase from another supplier. We    face substantial competition and many of our competitors have    significantly greater financial and other    resources.     Although no single company competes with us in all of our    businesses, we face substantial competition in each of our    segments, from international and domestic healthcare and    pharmaceutical companies of all sizes. Competition is primarily    focused on cost-effectiveness, price, service, product    performance, and technological innovation. Some competitors,    principally large pharmaceutical companies, have greater    financial, R&D and marketing resources than us. Competition    may increase further as additional companies begin to enter our    markets or modify their existing products to compete directly    with ours. Greater financial, R&D and marketing resources    may allow our competitors to respond more quickly to new or    emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements that    may render our products obsolete or non-competitive. If our    competitors develop more effective or affordable products, or    achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization    than we do, our operations will likely be negatively affected.     We also face competition for marketing, distribution and    collaborative development agreements, for establishing    relationships with academic and research institutions, and for    licenses to intellectual property. In addition, academic    institutions, government agencies and other public and private    research organizations may also conduct research, seek patent    protection and establish collaborative arrangements for    discovery, research, clinical development and marketing of    products similar to ours. These companies and institutions    compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific    and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies    complementary to our programs. If we are unable to successfully    compete with these companies and institutions, our business may    suffer.    8 If we    are unable to obtain sufficient components or raw materials on a    timely basis, our business may be adversely    affected.     The manufacture of our products requires the timely delivery of    sufficient amounts of quality components and materials. We    manufacture our products in over 50 manufacturing facilities    around the world. We acquire our components and materials from    many suppliers in various countries. While efforts are made to    diversify our sources of components and materials, in certain    instances we acquire components and materials from a sole    supplier. We work closely with our suppliers to ensure the    continuity of supply but we cannot guarantee these efforts will    continue to be successful. In addition, due to the regulatory    environment in which we operate, we may be unable to quickly    establish additional or replacement sources for some components    or materials. A reduction or interruption in supply, and an    inability to develop alternative sources for such supply, could    adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in a    timely or cost-effective manner, and our ability to make product    sales. If we    are unable to protect our patents or other proprietary rights,    or if we infringe on the patents or other proprietary rights of    others, our competitiveness and business prospects may be    materially damaged.     Patent and other proprietary rights are essential to our    business. Our success depends to a significant degree on our    ability to obtain and enforce patents and licenses to patent    rights, both in the United States and in other countries. We    cannot guarantee that pending patent applications will result in    issued patents, that patents issued or licensed will not be    challenged or circumvented by competitors, that our patents will    not be found to be invalid or that the intellectual property    rights of others will not prevent the company from selling    certain products or including key features in the companys    products.     The patent position of a healthcare company is often uncertain    and involves complex legal and factual questions. Significant    litigation concerning patents and products is pervasive in our    industry. Patent claims include challenges to the coverage and    validity of our patents on products or processes as well as    allegations that our products infringe patents held by    competitors or other third parties. A loss in any of these types    of cases could result in a loss of patent protection or the    ability to market products, which could lead to a significant    loss of sales, or otherwise materially affect future results of    operations.     We also rely on trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and    know-how to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive    positions. While we protect our proprietary rights to the extent    possible, we cannot guarantee that third parties will not know,    discover or develop independently equivalent proprietary    information or techniques, or that they will not gain access to    our trade secrets or disclose our trade secrets to the public.    Therefore, we cannot guarantee that we can maintain and protect    unpatented proprietary information and trade secrets.    Misappropriation or other loss of our intellectual property    would have an adverse effect on our competitive position and may    cause us to incur substantial litigation costs. If our    business development activities are unsuccessful, our business    could suffer and our financial performance could be adversely    affected.     We are engaged in business development activities including    evaluating acquisitions, joint development opportunities,    technology licensing arrangements and other opportunities. These    activities may result in substantial investment of the    companys resources. Our success developing products or    expanding into new markets from such activities will depend on a    number of factors, including our ability to find suitable    opportunities for acquisition, investment or alliance; whether    we are able to establish an acquisition, investment or alliance    on terms that are satisfactory to us; the strength of the other    companys underlying technology, products and ability to    execute its business strategies; any intellectual property and    litigation related to these products or technology; and our    ability to successfully integrate the acquired company,    business, product, technology or research into our existing    operations, including the ability to adequately fund acquired    in-process research and development projects. If we are    unsuccessful in our business development activities, we may be    unable to meet our financial targets and we may be required to    record asset impairment charges.    9 If we    are unsuccessful in identifying growth opportunities or exiting    low margin businesses or discontinuing low profit products, our    business, financial condition and results could be adversely    affected.     Successful execution of our business strategy depends, in part,    on improving the profit margins we earn with respect to our    current and future products. A failure to identify and take    advantage of opportunities that allow us to increase our profit    margins or a failure by us to exit low profit margin businesses    or discontinue low profit margin products, may result in us    failing to meet our financial targets and may otherwise have an    adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results    of operations. We are    subject to risks associated with doing business    globally.     Our operations, both inside and outside the United States, are    subject to risks inherent in conducting business globally and    under the laws, regulations and customs of various jurisdictions    and geographies. These risks include fluctuations in currency    exchange rates, changes in exchange controls, loss of business    in government tenders that are held annually in many cases,    nationalization, increasingly complex labor environments,    expropriation and other governmental actions, availability of    raw materials, changes in taxation, including legislative    changes in United States and international taxation of income    earned outside of the United States, importation limitations,    export control restrictions, changes in or violations of    U.S. or local laws, including the FCPA, dependence on a few    government entities as customers, pricing restrictions, economic    and political destabilization or instability, disputes between    countries, diminished or insufficient protection of intellectual    property, disruption or destruction of operations in a    significant geographic region  due to the location of    manufacturing facilities, distribution facilities or    customers  regardless of cause, including war,    terrorism, riot, civil insurrection or social unrest, or natural    or man-made disasters, including famine, flood, fire,    earthquake, storm or disease. Failure to comply with the laws    and regulations that affect our global operations could have an    adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results    of operations. We are    subject to foreign currency exchange risk.     In 2009, we generated approximately 60% of our revenue outside    the United States. We anticipate that revenue from outside the    United States will continue to represent a majority of our total    revenue. As a result, our financial results may continue to be    adversely affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange    rates. Market volatility and currency fluctuations may also    reduce the benefits from our natural hedges and limit our    ability to cost-effectively hedge against our foreign currency    exposure. A discussion of the financial impact of foreign    exchange rate fluctuations and the ways and extent to which we    attempt to mitigate such impact is contained under the heading    Financial Instrument Market Risk in Item 7 of    this Annual Report on    Form 10-K.    We cannot predict with any certainty changes in foreign currency    exchange rates or the degree to which we can mitigate these    risks. Challenges    in the commercial and credit environment may adversely affect    our business and financial condition.     The companys ability to generate cash flows from    operations could be affected if there is a material decline in    the demand for the companys products, in the solvency of    its customers or suppliers, or deterioration in the    companys key financial ratios or credit rating. Current or    worsening economic conditions may adversely affect our business    and the business of our customers, including their ability to    pay for our products and services, and the amount spent on    healthcare generally. This could result in a decrease in the    demand for our products and services, longer sales cycles,    slower adoption of new technologies and increased price    competition. These conditions may also adversely affect certain    of our suppliers, which could cause a disruption in our ability    to produce our products. "
1,BAX,BAXTER INTERNATIONAL INC,2009-02-19,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors.     In addition to the other information in this Annual Report on    Form 10-K,    shareholders or prospective investors should carefully consider    the following risk factors. If any of the events described below    occurs, our business, financial condition and results of    operations and future growth prospects could suffer.  If we    are unable to successfully introduce new products or fail to    keep pace with advances in technology, our business, financial    condition and results of operations could be adversely    affected.     The successful and timely implementation of our business model    depends on our ability to adapt to changing technologies and    introduce new products. As Baxters competitors will    continue to introduce competitive products, the development and    acquisition of innovative products and technologies that improve    efficacy, safety, patients and clinicians ease of    use and cost-effectiveness are important to Baxters    success. The success of new product offerings will depend on    many factors, including our ability to properly anticipate and    satisfy customer needs, obtain regulatory approvals on a timely    basis, develop and manufacture products in an economic and    timely manner, maintain advantageous positions with respect to    intellectual property, and differentiate our products from those    of our competitors. A failure by us to introduce planned    products or other new products or to introduce these products on    schedule could have an adverse effect on our business, financial    condition and results of operations.     The development and acquisition of innovative products and    technologies that improve efficacy, safety, patients and    clinicians ease of use and cost-effectiveness involve    significant technical and business risks. If we cannot adapt to    changing technologies, our products may become obsolete, and our    business could suffer. Because the healthcare industry is    characterized by rapid technological change, we may be unable to    anticipate changes in our current and potential customers    requirements. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability    to continue to enhance our existing products, develop new    technology that addresses the increasingly sophisticated and    varied needs of our prospective customers, license or acquire    leading technologies and respond to technological advances and    emerging industry standards and practices on a timely and    cost-effective basis.    6Table of ContentsWe are    subject to a number of existing laws and regulations,    non-compliance with which could adversely affect our business,    financial condition and results of operations, and we are    susceptible to a changing regulatory environment.     As a participant in the healthcare industry, our operations and    products, and those of our customers, are regulated by numerous    government agencies, both within and outside the United States.    The impact of this on us is direct, to the extent we are subject    to these laws and regulations, and indirect in that in a number    of situations, even though we may not be directly regulated by    specific healthcare laws and regulations, our products must be    capable of being used by our customers in a manner that complies    with those laws and regulations.     The manufacture, distribution and marketing of our products are    subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the FDA and other    regulatory authorities both within and outside the United    States. Any new product must undergo lengthy and rigorous    testing and other extensive, costly and time-consuming    procedures mandated by the FDA and foreign regulatory    authorities. We may elect to delay or cancel our anticipated    regulatory submissions for new indications for our current or    proposed new products for a number of reasons. Failure to comply    with the requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities    could result in warning letters, product recalls or seizures,    monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and    distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal    of a government to grant approvals, restrictions on operations    or withdrawal of existing approvals. Any of these actions could    cause a loss of customer confidence in us and our products,    which could adversely affect our sales.     We continue to address issues with our infusion pumps as    discussed further under the caption entitled Certain    Regulatory Matters in Managements Discussion    and Analysis of the Annual Report. In connection with    these issues, there can be no assurance that additional costs or    civil and criminal penalties will not be incurred, that    additional regulatory actions with respect to the company will    not occur, that substantial additional charges or significant    asset impairments may not be required, or that additional    legislation or regulation will not be introduced that may    adversely affect the companys operations. Third parties    may also file claims against us in connection with these pump    issues. In addition, sales of these products may continue to be    affected and sales of other Baxter products may be adversely    affected if we do not adequately address these pump issues.     In addition, the healthcare regulatory environment may change in    a way that restricts our existing operations or our growth. The    healthcare industry is likely to continue to undergo significant    changes for the foreseeable future, which could have an adverse    effect on our business, financial condition and results of    operations. We cannot predict the effect of possible future    legislation and regulation.  Failure    to provide quality products and services to our customers could    have an adverse effect on our business and subject us to    regulatory actions and costly litigation.     Quality management plays an essential role in determining and    meeting customer requirements, preventing defects and improving    the companys products and services. Our future operating    results will depend on our ability to implement and improve our    quality management program, and effectively train and manage our    employee base with respect to quality management. While Baxter    has a network of quality systems throughout our business units    and facilities, which relates to the design, development,    manufacturing, packaging, sterilization, handling, distribution    and labeling of our products, quality and safety issues may    occur with respect to any of our products. In addition, some of    the raw materials employed in Baxters production processes    are derived from human and animal origins. Though great care is    taken to assure the safety of these raw materials, the nature of    their origin elevates the potential for the introduction of    pathogenic agents or other contaminants.     A quality or safety issue could have an adverse effect on our    business, financial condition and results of operations and may    result in warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary    sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of    products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a government    to grant approvals, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of    existing approvals. An inability to address a quality or safety    issue in an effective manner on a timely basis may also cause a    loss of customer confidence in us or our products, which may    result in losses of sales. In addition, we may be named as a    defendant in product    7Table of Contents    liability lawsuits, which could result in costly litigation,    reduced sales, significant liabilities and diversion of our    managements time, attention and resources. Even claims    without merit could subject us to adverse publicity and require    us to incur significant legal fees.     In 2008, we removed our heparin sodium injection products from    distribution in the United States after identifying an    increasing level of allergic-type and hypotensive adverse    reactions occurring in certain patients. For more information on    this recall and the lawsuits we face in connection with this    recall, please refer to Certain Regulatory Matters    in Managements Discussion and Analysis of the    Annual Report and Notes to Consolidated Financial    Statements  Note 11 Legal Proceedings of    the Annual Report. If    reimbursement for our current or future products is reduced or    modified, our business could suffer.     Sales of our products depend, in part, on the extent to which    the costs of our products are paid by health maintenance,    managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management    organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration    authorities, private health coverage insurers and other    third-party payors. These healthcare management organizations    and third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices    charged for medical products and services. Additionally, the    containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal    and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been    targeted in this effort. We also face challenges in certain    foreign markets where the pricing and profitability of our    products generally are subject to government controls.    Government controls in foreign markets also impact our ability    to collect accounts receivable in a timely manner. Accordingly,    our current and potential products may not be considered cost    effective, and reimbursement to the consumer may not be    available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a    competitive basis. Legislation and regulations affecting    reimbursement for our products may change at any time and in    ways that are difficult to predict and these changes may be    adverse to us. Any reduction in Medicare, Medicaid or other    third-party payor reimbursements could have a negative effect on    our operating results. If we    are unable to obtain sufficient components and/or raw materials    on a timely basis, our business may be adversely    affected.     The manufacture of our products requires the timely delivery of    sufficient amounts of quality components and materials. We    manufacture our products in over 50 manufacturing facilities    around the world. We acquire our components and materials from    many suppliers in various countries. While efforts are made to    diversify our sources of components and materials, in certain    instances we acquire components and materials from a sole    supplier. We work closely with our suppliers to ensure the    continuity of supply but we cannot guarantee these efforts will    continue to be successful. In addition, due to the regulatory    environment in which we operate, we may not be able to quickly    establish additional or replacement sources for some components    or materials. A reduction or interruption in supply, and an    inability to develop alternative sources for such supply, could    adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in a    timely or cost-effective manner, and our ability to make product    sales. Consolidation    in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business,    financial condition and results of operations.     There has been consolidation in our customer base, and by our    competitors, which has resulted in pricing and sales pressures.    As these consolidations occur, competition to provide products    like ours will become more intense, and the importance of    establishing relationships with key industry participants    including GPOs, IDNs and other customers will become greater.    Customers will continue to work and organize to negotiate price    reductions for our products and services. To the extent we are    forced to reduce our prices, our business will become less    profitable unless we are able to achieve corresponding    reductions in costs. The companys sales could be adversely    affected if any of its contracts with its GPOs, IDNs or other    customers are terminated in part or in their entirety, or    members decide to purchase from another supplier. If we    are unable to protect our patents or other proprietary rights,    or if we infringe on the patents or other proprietary rights of    others, our competitiveness and business prospects may be    materially damaged.     Patent and other proprietary rights are essential to our    business. Our success depends to a significant degree on our    ability to obtain and enforce patents and licenses to patent    rights, both in the United States and    8Table of Contents    in other countries. We cannot assure that pending patent    applications will result in issued patents, that patents issued    or licensed will not be challenged or circumvented by    competitors, that our patents will not be found to be invalid or    that the intellectual property rights of others will not prevent    the company from selling certain products or including key    features in the companys products.     The patent position of a healthcare company is often uncertain    and involves complex legal and factual questions. Significant    litigation concerning patents and products is pervasive in our    industry. Patent claims include challenges to the coverage and    validity of our patents on products or processes as well as    allegations that our products infringe patents held by    competitors or other third parties. A loss in any of these types    of cases could result in a loss of patent protection or the    ability to market products, which could lead to a significant    loss of sales, or otherwise materially affect future results of    operations.     We also rely on trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and    know-how to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive    positions. While we protect our proprietary rights to the extent    possible, we cannot guarantee that third parties will not know,    discover or develop independently equivalent proprietary    information or techniques, or that they will not gain access to    our trade secrets or disclose our trade secrets to the public.    Therefore, we cannot guarantee that we can maintain and protect    unpatented proprietary information and trade secrets.    Misappropriation of our intellectual property would have an    adverse effect on our competitive position and may cause us to    incur substantial litigation costs.  If our    business development activities are unsuccessful, our business    could suffer and our financial performance could be adversely    affected.     We are engaged in business development activities including    evaluating acquisitions, joint development opportunities,    technology licensing arrangements and other opportunities. These    activities may result in substantial investment of the    companys resources. Our success developing products or    expanding into new markets from such activities will depend on a    number of factors, including our ability to find suitable    opportunities for acquisition, investment or alliance; whether    we are able to establish an acquisition, investment or alliance    on terms that are satisfactory to us; the strength of the other    companys underlying technology, products and ability to    execute its business strategies; any intellectual property and    litigation related to these products or technology; and our    ability to successfully integrate the acquired company,    business, product, technology or research into our existing    operations including the ability to adequately fund acquired    in-process research and development projects. If we are    unsuccessful in our business development activities, we may be    unable to meet our financial targets and we may be required to    record asset impairment charges.  If we    are unsuccessful in identifying growth opportunities or if we    are unsuccessful in exiting low margin businesses or    discontinuing low profit products, our business, financial    condition and results could be adversely affected.     Successful execution of our business strategy depends, in part,    on improving the profit margins we earn with respect to our    current and future products. A failure to identify and take    advantage of opportunities that allow us to increase our profit    margins or a failure by us to exit low profit margin businesses    or discontinue low profit margin products, may result in us    failing to meet our financial targets and may otherwise have an    adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results    of operations.  We    face substantial competition and many of our competitors have    significantly greater financial and other    resources.     Although no single company competes with Baxter in all of its    businesses, Baxter faces substantial competition in each of its    segments, from international and domestic healthcare and    pharmaceutical companies of all sizes. Competition is primarily    focused on cost-effectiveness, price, service, product    performance, and technological innovation. Some competitors,    principally large pharmaceutical companies, have greater    financial, research and development and marketing resources than    Baxter. Competition may increase further as additional companies    begin to enter our markets or modify their existing products to    compete directly with ours. Greater financial, research and    development and marketing resources may allow our competitors to    respond more quickly    9Table of Contents    to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer    requirements that may render our products obsolete or    non-competitive. If our competitors develop more effective or    affordable products, or achieve earlier patent protection or    product commercialization than we do, our operations will likely    be negatively affected.     We also face competition for marketing, distribution and    collaborative development agreements, for establishing    relationships with academic and research institutions, and for    licenses to intellectual property. In addition, academic    institutions, government agencies and other public and private    research organizations may also conduct research, seek patent    protection and establish collaborative arrangements for    discovery, research, clinical development and marketing of    products similar to ours. These companies and institutions    compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific    and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies    complementary to our programs. If we are unable to successfully    compete with these companies and institutions, our business may    suffer.  We are    subject to risks associated with doing business    globally.     Our operations, both within and outside the United States, are    subject to risks inherent in conducting business globally and    under the laws, regulations and customs of various jurisdictions    and geographies. These risks include fluctuations in currency    exchange rates, changes in exchange controls, loss of business    in government tenders that are held annually in many cases,    nationalization, increasingly complex labor environments,    expropriation and other governmental actions, changes in    taxation, including legislative changes in United States and    international taxation of income earned outside of the United    States, importation limitations, export control restrictions,    violations of U.S. or local laws, including the U.S.    Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), dependence on a few    government entities as customers, pricing restrictions, economic    destabilization, instability, disruption or destruction in a    significant geographic region  due to the location of    manufacturing facilities, distribution facilities or    customers  regardless of cause, including war,    terrorism, riot, civil insurrection or social unrest, or natural    or man-made disasters, including famine, flood, fire,    earthquake, storm or disease. Failure to comply with the laws    and regulations that affect our global operations, including the    FCPA, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial    condition or results of operations.  We are    subject to foreign currency exchange risk.     In 2008, we generated approximately 60% of our revenue outside    the United States. Our financial results may be adversely    affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,    especially in light of recent market volatility and drastic    movements in currency exchange rates. These conditions may also    reduce the benefits from our natural hedges and limit our    ability to cost-effectively hedge against our foreign currency    exposure. A discussion of the financial impact of foreign    exchange rate fluctuations and the ways and extent to which we    attempt to mitigate such impact is contained under the heading    Financial Instrument Market Risk contained in    Managements Discussion and Analysis of the    Annual Report. We cannot predict with any certainty changes in    foreign currency exchange rates or the degree to which we can    mitigate these risks.  Current    challenges in the commercial and credit environment may    adversely affect our business and financial    condition.     The global financial markets have recently experienced    unprecedented levels of volatility. The companys ability    to generate cash flows from operations, issue debt or enter into    other financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be    adversely affected if there is a material decline in the demand    for the companys products or in the solvency of its    customers or suppliers, deterioration in the companys key    financial ratios or credit ratings, or other significantly    unfavorable changes in conditions. While these conditions and    the current economic downturn have not meaningfully impaired our    ability to access credit markets or meaningfully adversely    affected our operations to date, continuing volatility in the    global financial markets could increase borrowing costs or    affect the companys ability to access the capital markets.    Current or worsening economic conditions may also adversely    affect the business of our customers, including their ability to    pay for our products and services, and the amount spent on    healthcare generally. This could result in a decrease in the    demand for our products and services, longer sales cycles,    slower adoption of new technologies and increased price    competition. These conditions may also adversely affect certain    of our suppliers, which could cause a disruption in our ability    to produce our products.    10Table of Contents"
9,BAX,BAXTER INTERNATIONAL INC,2008-02-26,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors.     In addition to the other information in this Annual Report on    Form 10-K,    shareholders or prospective investors should carefully consider    the following risk factors. If any of the events described below    occurs, our business, financial condition and results of    operations and future growth prospects could suffer. If we    are unable to successfully introduce new products or fail to    keep pace with advances in technology, our business, financial    condition and results of operations could be adversely    affected.     The successful and timely implementation of our business model    depends on our ability to adapt to changing technologies and    introduce new products. The success of new product offerings    will depend on many factors, including our ability to properly    anticipate and satisfy customer needs, obtain regulatory    approvals on a timely basis, develop and manufacture products in    an economic and timely manner, maintain advantageous positions    with respect to intellectual property, and differentiate our    products from those of our competitors. A failure by us to    introduce planned products or other new products or to introduce    these products on schedule could have an adverse effect on our    business, financial condition and results of operations.     The development and acquisition of innovative products and    technologies that improve efficacy, safety, patients ease    of use and cost-effectiveness are important to Baxters    success and involve significant technical and business risks. If    we cannot adapt to changing technologies, our products may    become obsolete, and our business could suffer. Because the    healthcare industry is characterized by rapid technological    change, we may be unable to anticipate changes in our current    and potential customers requirements. Our success will    depend, in part, on our ability to continue to enhance our    existing products, develop new technology that addresses the    increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our prospective    customers, license or acquire leading technologies and respond    to technological advances and emerging industry standards and    practices on a timely and cost-effective basis. If our    business development activities are unsuccessful, our business    could suffer and our financial performance could be adversely    affected.     We are engaged in business development activities including    evaluating acquisitions, joint development opportunities,    technology licensing arrangements and other opportunities. These    activities may result in substantial investment of the    companys resources. Our success developing products from    such activities will depend on a number of factors, including    our ability to find suitable opportunities for acquisition,    investment or alliance, whether we are able to establish an    acquisition, investment or alliance on terms that are    satisfactory to us, the strength of the other companys    underlying technology, products and its ability to execute its    business strategies, any intellectual property and litigation    related to these products or technology, and our ability to    successfully integrate the acquired company, business, product,    technology or research into our existing operations including    the ability to adequately fund acquired in-process research and    development projects. If we are unsuccessful in our business    development activities, we may be unable to meet our financial    targets and we may be required to record asset impairment    charges. If we    are unsuccessful in identifying growth opportunities or if we    are unsuccessful in exiting low margin businesses or products,    our business, financial condition and results could be adversely    affected.     Successful execution of our business strategy depends, in part,    on improving the profit margins we earn with respect to our    current and future products. A failure to identify and take    advantage of opportunities which allow us to increase our profit    margins or a failure by us to exit low profit margin businesses    or    7     terminate low profit margin products, may result in us failing    to meet our financial targets and may otherwise have an adverse    effect on our business, financial condition and results of    operations. We are    subject to a number of existing laws and regulations,    non-compliance with which could adversely affect our business,    financial condition and results of operations, and we are    susceptible to a changing regulatory environment.     As a participant in the healthcare industry, our operations and    products, and those of our customers, are regulated by numerous    governmental agencies, both within and outside the United    States. The impact of this on us is direct, to the extent we are    subject to these laws and regulations, and indirect in that in a    number of situations, even though we may not be directly    regulated by specific healthcare laws and regulations, our    products must be capable of being used by our customers in a    manner that complies with those laws and regulations.     The manufacture, distribution and marketing of our products are    subject to extensive ongoing regulation by the FDA and other    regulatory authorities both within and outside the United    States. Any new product must undergo lengthy and rigorous    clinical testing and other extensive, costly and time-consuming    procedures mandated by the FDA and foreign regulatory    authorities. We may elect to delay or cancel our anticipated    regulatory submissions for new indications for our current or    proposed new products for a number of reasons. Failure to comply    with the requirements of the FDA or other regulatory authorities    could result in warning letters, product recalls or seizures,    monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and    distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal    of a government to grant approvals, restrictions on operations    or withdrawal of existing approvals. Any of these actions could    cause a loss of customer confidence in us and our products,    which could adversely affect our sales.     We continue to address issues with our infusion pumps as    discussed further under the caption entitled Certain    Regulatory Matters in Managements Discussion    and Analysis of Baxters Annual Report to    Shareholders for fiscal year 2007. There can be no assurance    that we will resolve these pump issues without incurring    additional charges or facing any of the sanctions available to    the FDA under the Consent Decree entered into with the FDA    concerning our infusion pumps. Third parties may file claims    against us in connection with these pump issues. In addition,    sales of these products may continue to be affected and sales of    related products may be adversely affected if we do not    adequately address these pump issues.     In addition, the healthcare regulatory environment may change in    a way that restricts our existing operations or our growth. The    healthcare industry is likely to continue to undergo significant    changes for the foreseeable future, which could have an adverse    effect on our business, financial condition and results of    operations. We cannot predict the effect of possible future    legislation and regulation. If    reimbursement for our current or future products is reduced or    modified, our business could suffer.     Sales of our products depend, in part, on the extent to which    the costs of our products are paid by health maintenance,    managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare management    organizations, or reimbursed by government health administration    authorities, private health coverage insurers and other    third-party payors. These healthcare management organizations    and third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices    charged for medical products and services. Additionally, the    containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal    and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been    targeted in this effort. We also face challenges in certain    foreign markets where the pricing and profitability of our    products generally are subject to government controls.    Accordingly, our current and potential products may not be    considered cost effective, and reimbursement to the consumer may    not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our products    on a competitive basis. Legislation and regulations affecting    reimbursement for our products may change at any time, including    in ways that are adverse to us. Any reduction in Medicare,    Medicaid or other third-party payor reimbursements could have a    negative effect on our operating results.    8 If we    are unable to obtain sufficient components and/or raw materials    on a timely basis, our business may be adversely    affected.     The manufacture of our products requires the timely delivery of    sufficient amounts of quality components and materials. We    manufacture our products in over 50 manufacturing facilities    around the world. We acquire our components and materials from    many suppliers in various countries. Efforts are made to    diversify our sources of components and materials, however, in    certain instances, we acquire components and materials from a    sole supplier. We work closely with our suppliers to ensure the    continuity of supply but we cannot guarantee these efforts will    continue to be successful. In addition, due to the regulatory    environment in which we operate, we may not be able to quickly    establish additional or replacement sources for some components    or materials. A reduction or interruption in supply, and an    inability to develop alternative sources for such supply, could    adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products in a    timely or cost effective manner and our ability to make product    sales. Failure    to provide quality products and services to our customers could    have an adverse effect on our business and subject us to    regulatory actions and costly litigation.     Our future operating results will depend on our ability to    implement and improve our quality management program, and    effectively train and manage our employee base with respect to    quality management. Quality management plays an essential role    in determining and meeting customer requirements, preventing    defects and improving the companys products and services.    While Baxter has a network of quality systems throughout our    business units and facilities, which relates to the design,    development, manufacturing, packaging, sterilization, handling,    distribution and labeling of our products, quality and safety    issues may occur with respect to any of our products. A quality    or safety issue could have an adverse effect on our business,    financial condition and results of operations and may result in    warning letters, product recalls or seizures, monetary    sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution of    products, civil or criminal sanctions, refusal of a government    to grant approvals, restrictions on operations or withdrawal of    existing approvals. In addition, we may be named as a defendant    in product liability lawsuits, which could result in costly    litigation, reduced sales, significant liabilities and diversion    of our managements time, attention and resources. Even    claims without merit could subject us to adverse publicity and    require us to incur significant legal fees. Consolidation    in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business,    financial condition and results of operations.     There has been consolidation in our customer base, and by our    competitors, which has resulted in pricing and sales pressures.    As these consolidations occur, competition to provide products    like ours will become more intense, and the importance of    establishing relationships with key industry participants    including GPOs and IDNs will become greater. Customers will    continue to work and organize to negotiate price reductions for    our products and services. To the extent we are forced to reduce    our prices, our business will become less profitable unless we    are able to achieve corresponding reductions in our expenses.    The companys sales could be adversely affected if any of    its contracts with its GPOs or IDNs are terminated in part or in    their entirety, or members decide to purchase from another    supplier. If we    are unable to protect our patents or other proprietary rights or    if we infringe upon the patents or other proprietary rights of    others, our competitiveness and business prospects may be    materially damaged.     Patent and other proprietary rights are essential to our    business. Our success depends to a significant degree on our    ability to obtain and enforce patents and licenses to patent    rights, both in the United States and in other countries. The    patent position of a healthcare company is often uncertain and    involves complex legal and factual questions. Significant    litigation concerning patents and products is pervasive in our    industry. Patent claims include challenges to the coverage and    validity of our patents on products or processes as well as    allegations that our products infringe patents held by    competitors or other third parties. A loss in any of these types    of cases could result in a loss of patent protection or the    ability to market products, which could lead to a significant    loss of sales, or otherwise materially affect future results of    operations.    9     We also rely on trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and    know-how to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive    positions. While we protect our proprietary rights to the extent    possible, we cannot guarantee that third parties will not know,    discover or develop independently equivalent proprietary    information or techniques, that they will not gain access to our    trade secrets or disclose our trade secrets to the public.    Therefore, we cannot guarantee that we can maintain and protect    unpatented proprietary information and trade secrets.    Misappropriation of our intellectual property would have an    adverse effect on our competitive position and may cause us to    incur substantial litigation costs. We    face substantial competition and many of our competitors have    significantly greater financial and other    resources.     Although no single company competes with Baxter in all of its    businesses, Baxter faces substantial competition in each of its    segments, from international and domestic healthcare and    pharmaceutical companies of all sizes. Competition is primarily    focused on cost-effectiveness, price, service, product    performance, and technological innovation. Some competitors,    principally large pharmaceutical companies, have greater    financial, research and development and marketing resources than    Baxter. Competition may increase further as additional companies    begin to enter our markets or modify their existing products to    compete directly with ours. Greater financial, research and    development and marketing resources may allow our competitors to    respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes    in customer requirements that may render our products obsolete    or non-competitive. If our competitors develop more effective or    affordable products, or achieve earlier patent protection or    product commercialization than we do, our operations will likely    be negatively affected.     We also face competition for marketing, distribution and    collaborative development agreements, for establishing    relationships with academic and research institutions, and for    licenses to intellectual property. In addition, academic    institutions, government agencies and other public and private    research organizations also may conduct research, seek patent    protection and establish collaborative arrangements for    discovery, research, clinical development and marketing of    products similar to ours. These companies and institutions    compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific    and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies    complementary to our programs. If we are unable to successfully    compete with these companies and institutions our business may    suffer. We are    subject to risks associated with doing business    globally.     Our operations, both within and outside the United States, are    subject to risks inherent in conducting business globally and    under the laws, regulations and customs of various jurisdictions    and geographies. These risks include fluctuations in currency    exchange rates, nationalization, expropriation and other    governmental actions, importation limitations, violations of    U.S. or local laws, dependence on a few governmental    entities as customers, loss of business in governmental tenders    that are held annually in many cases, pricing restrictions,    economic destabilization, instability, disruption or destruction    in a significant geographic region  due to the    location of manufacturing facilities, distribution facilities or    customers  regardless of cause, including war,    terrorism, riot, civil insurrection or social unrest, or natural    or man-made disasters, including famine, flood, fire,    earthquake, storm or disease. "

The development of our proprietary technology entails    significant technical and business risks. If we    are unsuccessful in identifying growth opportunities in which to    invest or if we are unsuccessful in exiting low margin    businesses or products our business, financial condition and    results could be adversely affected.     Successful execution of our business strategy depends in part on    improving the profit margins we earn with respect to our current    and future products.

Any of these    actions could cause a loss of customer confidence in us and our    products which could adversely affect our sales.     We continue to address issues with our infusion pumps as    discussed further under the caption entitled COLLEAGUE    Matter in Managements Discussion and    Analysis  of Baxters Annual    Report to Shareholders for fiscal year 2006. There can be no    assurance that we will resolve these pump issues without    incurring additional charges or facing any of the sanctions    available to the FDA under the Consent Decree entered into with    the United States concerning our infusion pumps. Third parties may file    claims against us in connection these pump issues. In addition,    our sales of other products may be adversely affected if we    experience a loss of customer confidence as a result of these    pump issues.     In addition, the healthcare regulatory environment may change in    a way that restricts our existing operations or our growth. The    healthcare industry is likely to continue to undergo significant    changes for the foreseeable future, which could have an adverse    effect on our business, financial condition and results of    operations. We cannot predict the effect of possible future    legislation and regulation. If    reimbursement for our current or future products is reduced or    modified, our business would suffer.     Sales of our products depend, in part, on the extent to which    the costs of our products are paid by health maintenance,    managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar health care    management organizations, or reimbursed by government health    administration authorities, private health coverage insurers and    other third-party payors.

We also face    challenges in certain foreign markets where the pricing and    profitability of our products generally are subject to    government controls. Accordingly, our current and potential    products may not be considered cost effective, and reimbursement    to the consumer may not be available or sufficient to allow us    to sell our products on a competitive basis. Legislation and    regulations affecting reimbursement for our products may change    at any time, including in ways that are adverse to us. Any    reduction in Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payor    reimbursements could have a negative effect on our operating    results. Failure    to provide quality products and services to our customers could    have an adverse effect on our business and subject us to    regulatory actions and costly litigation.     Our future operating results will depend on our ability to    implement and improve our quality management program, and    effectively train and manage our employee base with respect to    quality management. We place significant emphasis on providing    quality products and services to our customers. Quality    management plays an essential role in determining and meeting    customer requirements, preventing defects and improving the    companys products and services. While Baxter has a network    of quality systems throughout our business units and facilities,    which relate to the design, development, manufacturing,    packaging, sterilization, handling, distribution and labeling of    our products, quality and safety issues may occur with respect    to any of our products. A quality or safety issue could have an    adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results    of operations and may result in any of the actions described inthe first paragraph above. In addition, we may be named    as a defendant in product liability lawsuits, which could result    in costly litigation, reduced sales, significant liabilities and    diversion of our managements time, attention and    resources. Even claims without merit could subject us to adverse    publicity and require us to incur significant legal fees.    8  Consolidation    in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business,    financial condition and results of operations.     There has been consolidation in our customer base, and by our    competitors, which has resulted in pricing and sales pressures.    As these consolidations occur, competition to provide products    like ours will become more intense, and the importance of    establishing relationships with key industry participants will    become greater. Customers will continue to work and organize to    negotiate price reductions for our products and services. To the    extent we are forced to reduce our prices, our business will    become less profitable unless we were able to achieve    corresponding reductions in our expenses. If we    are unable to protect our patents and other proprietary rights    or infringe upon the patents or other proprietary rights of    others, our competitiveness and business prospects may be    materially damaged.     Patent and other proprietary rights are essential to our    business. Our success depends to a significant degree on our    ability to obtain and enforce patents and licenses to patent    rights, both in the U.S. and in other countries. The patent    position of a healthcare company is often uncertain and involves    complex legal and factual questions. Significant litigation    concerning patents and products is pervasive in our industry.    Patent claims include challenges to the coverage and validity of    our patents on products or processes as well as allegations that    our products infringe patents held by competitors or other third    parties. A loss in any of these types of cases could result in a    loss of patent protection or the ability to market products,    which could lead to a significant loss of sales, or otherwise    materially affect future results of operations.     We also rely on trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets and    know-how to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive    positions. While we protect our proprietary rights to the extent    possible, we cannot guarantee that third parties will not know,    discover or develop independently equivalent proprietary    information or techniques, that they will not gain access to our    trade secrets or disclose our trade secrets to the public.    Therefore, we cannot guarantee that we can maintain and protect    unpatented proprietary information and trade secrets.    Misappropriation of our intellectual property would have an    adverse effect on our competitive position and may cause us to    incur substantial litigation costs. We    have many competitors, several of which have significantly    greater financial and other resources.     Although no single company competes with Baxter in all of its    businesses, Baxter faces substantial competition in each of its    segments, from international and domestic healthcare and    pharmaceutical companies of all sizes. Competition is primarily    focused on cost-effectiveness, price, service, product    performance, and technological innovation. Some competitors,    principally large pharmaceutical companies, have greater    financial, research and development and marketing resources than    Baxter. Competition may increase further as additional companies    begin to enter our markets or modify their existing products to    compete directly with ours. Greater financial, research and    development and marketing resources may allow our competitors to    respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes    in customer requirements that may render our products obsolete    or non-competitive. If our    competitors develop more effective or affordable products, or    achieve earlier patent protection or product commercialization    than we do, our operations will likely be negatively    affected.     We also face competition for marketing, distribution and    collaborative development agreements, for establishing    relationships with academic and research institutions, and for    licenses to intellectual property. In addition, academic    institutions, government agencies and other public and private    research organizations also may conduct research, seek patent    protection and establish collaborative arrangements for    discovery, research, clinical development and marketing of    products similar to ours. These companies and institutions    compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific    and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies    complementary to our programs.    9  We are    subject to risks associated with doing business    globally.     Our operations, both within and outside the United States, are    subject to risks inherent in conducting business globally and    under the laws, regulations and customs of various jurisdictions    and geographies. These risks include possible nationalization,    expropriation, importation limitations, violations of    U.S. or local laws, pricing restrictions, and other    restrictive governmental actions or economic destabilization,    instability, disruption or destruction in a significant    geographic region  due to the location of    manufacturing facilities, distribution facilities or    customers  regardless of cause, including war,    terrorism, riot, civil insurrection or social unrest, and    natural or man-made disasters, including famine, flood, fire,    earthquake, storm or disease. Also, fluctuations in foreign    currency exchange rates can impact our consolidated financial    results. "

If any of the events described belowoccurs, our business, financial condition and results ofoperations and future growth prospects could suffer.If we are unable to successfully introduce new products or    fail to keep pace with advances in technology, our business,    financial condition and results of operations could be adversely    affected.     The successful and timely implementation of our business modeldepends on our ability to adapt to changing technologies andintroduce new products. The success of new product offeringswill depend on many factors, including our ability to properlyanticipate and satisfy customer needs, obtain regulatoryapprovals on a timely basis, develop and manufacture products inan economic and timely manner, maintain advantageous positionswith respect to intellectual property, and differentiate ourproducts from those of our competitors. A failure by us tointroduce planned products or other new products or to introducethese products on schedule could have an adverse effect on ourbusiness, financial condition and results of operations.7Table of Contents     The development and acquisition of innovative products andtechnologies that improve efficacy, safety, patients easeof use and cost-effectiveness are important to Baxterssuccess. If we cannot adapt to changing technologies, ourproducts may become obsolete, and our business could suffer.Because the healthcare industry is characterized by rapidtechnological change, we may be unable to anticipate changes inour current and potential customers requirements. Oursuccess will depend, in part, on our ability to continue toenhance our existing products, develop new technology thataddresses the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of ourprospective customers, license or acquire leading technologiesand respond to technological advances and emerging industrystandards and practices on a timely and cost-effective basis.The development of our proprietary technology entailssignificant technical and business risks.We are subject to a number of existing laws and    regulations, non-compliance with certain of which could    adversely affect our business, financial condition and results    of operations, and we are susceptible to a changing regulatory    environment.     As a participant in the healthcare industry, our operations andproducts, and those of our customers, are regulated by numerousgovernmental agencies, both within and outside the UnitedStates. The impact of this on us is direct, to the extent we areourselves subject to these laws and regulations, and is alsoindirect in that in a number of situations, even though we maynot be directly regulated by specific healthcare laws andregulations, our products must be capable of being used by ourcustomers in a manner that complies with those laws andregulations.     The manufacture, distribution and marketing of our products aresubject to extensive ongoing regulation by the FDA. Any newproduct must undergo lengthy and rigorous clinical testing andother extensive, costly and time-consuming procedures mandatedby the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities. We may elect todelay or cancel our anticipated regulatory submissions for newindications for our current or proposed new products for anumber of reasons. Failure to comply with the requirements ofthe FDA could result in warning letters, product recalls orseizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufactureand distribution of products, civil or criminal sanctions,refusal of the government to grant approvals, restrictions onoperations or withdrawal of existing approvals.     We are currently addressing issues with our infusion pumps thatare discussed further under the caption entitled COLLEAGUEMatter in Managements Discussion andAnalysis on pages 42-43 of Baxters AnnualReport to Shareholders for fiscal year 2005. Although we areworking to resolve these pump issues with the FDA and in relatedlitigation, we nevertheless are subject to administrative andlegal actions. These actions include product recalls, additionalproduct seizures, injunctions to halt manufacture anddistribution, restrictions on our operations, civil sanctions,including monetary sanctions, and criminal actions. Any of theseactions could have an adverse effect on our business and subjectus to additional regulatory actions including costly litigation.There can be no assurance that we will resolve these pump issueswithout incurring additional charges or facing sanctions. Inaddition, our sales of other products may be adversely affectedif we experience a loss of customer confidence as a result ofthese pump issues.     In addition, the healthcare regulatory environment may change ina way that restricts our existing operations or our growth. Thehealthcare industry is likely to continue to undergo significantchanges for the foreseeable future, which could have an adverseeffect on our business, financial condition and results ofoperations. We cannot predict the effect of possible futurelegislation and regulation.If reimbursement for our current or future products is    reduced or modified, our business would suffer.     Sales of our products depends, in part, on the extent to whichthe costs of our products are paid by health maintenance,managed care, pharmacy benefit and similar healthcare managementorganizations, or reimbursed by government health administrationauthorities, private health coverage insurers and otherthird-party payors. These healthcare management organizationsand third-party payors are increasingly challenging the pricescharged for medical products and services. Additionally, thecontainment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federaland state governments, and the prices of drugs have been8Table of Contentstargeted in this effort. We also face challenges in certainforeign markets where the pricing and profitability of ourproducts generally are subject to government controls.Accordingly, our current and potential products may not beconsidered cost effective, and reimbursement to the consumer maynot be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our productson a competitive basis.
