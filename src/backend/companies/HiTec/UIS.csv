6,UIS,UNISYS CORP,2024-02-26,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSWe are subject to a wide range of factors that could materially affect future performance. Because of these factors, past performance may not be a reliable indicator of future results. You should carefully consider, together with the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the risks and uncertainties described below. These risks may have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows. In addition to these risks, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that adversely affect our business, performance or financial condition in the future that are not presently known, are not currently believed to be significant or are not identified below because they are common to most or all companies.BUSINESS AND OPERATING RISKSCyber incidents, security breaches and other disruptions in our IT systems have occurred and will continue to occur that could result in the incurrence of significant costs as well as harm to our business.Our business includes managing, processing, storing and transmitting information, including proprietary, confidential, client, employee and personal information, intellectual property and proprietary business information. This information is housed within our own information systems (made of a combination of on-premise and third-party cloud providers), the cloud and those that we design, develop, host or manage for clients. These systems are critical to our and our clients’ business activities and unauthorized access to, disruption of, or attacks on these systems pose serious risks, including inadvertent loss or disclosure of company, information and employee and client data. In addition, negligent or improper conduct of our employees or third parties working on our behalf with access to these systems and the sensitive information housed therein have and may in the future adversely affect our business and reputation. We have experienced, and will continue to experience, cybersecurity attacks and other security breaches that have and, in the future, could result in access to, or in some instances, loss or disclosure of, sensitive information that would require significant human and financial resources to respond. These include cyberattacks from computer hackers, cyber criminals, including nation states and nation state-sponsored actors, insiders and other malicious internet-based adversaries. The occurrence of cybersecurity attacks and other security breaches continue to increase globally, and our systems, including the systems of our outsourced service providers, have been and may in the future be targeted by attacks such as denial of service attacks, wireless network attacks, viruses and worms, malicious software, ransomware, malware, misconfigurations, supply chain attacks, application centric attacks, peer-to-peer attacks, phishing, vishing and smishing attempts, backdoor trojans, distributed denial of service attacks, social engineering, business email compromises and cyber-extortion, among other cybersecurity threats. As a known provider of IT solutions, we are and will remain an attractive target for such attacks. Furthermore, our industry subjects us to elevated risk and, accordingly, security vulnerabilities can occur and will continue to occur across a broad range of hardware, software or other infrastructure, increasing for us the potential of occurrence and the cost of response and remediation. These attacks have been successful against us and those of our third-party service providers and have resulted in, and in the future could result in, misappropriation, misuse, alteration, theft, loss, corruption, leakage, falsification, and accidental or premature release or improper disclosure of confidential or other information, including intellectual property, personal information, and data of the company, third parties, employees, clients or others. For example, in 2022, the company disclosed a cyber attack involving our software lab environment, which caused no service disruptions for our operations or, to our knowledge, to our clients, but resulted in the exfiltration of source code for our cybersecurity and product and platform software. The techniques used by computer hackers and cyber criminals to obtain unauthorized access to data or to sabotage computer systems change frequently and are growing in sophistication, which increases the risk and severity when they occur. Additionally, limitations in the ability of our IT teams to remain up-to-date with the tools necessary to thwart these threat actors could lead to attacks not being detected until after the attack has occurred. In addition, we rely on our suppliers’ tools and services to adequately detect, report and respond to cyber incidents and security breaches, which could affect our ability to report or address these incidents effectively or in a timely manner. An increase in consumption of public cloud services also elevates the risk to our environment, as securing cloud workload regularly involves new skills, tools and processes. The introduction of AI and quantum computing is also raising the risk level as it opens new possibilities for threat actors to launch complex attacks combining social engineering and classic hacking techniques. Similarly, the threat of malicious cyber activity from nation states and other sophisticated actors continues to increase, particularly with the rise of global conflicts like in the Ukraine.Any disruption, termination or substandard provision of services, including by us or third-party cloud providers, could materially and adversely affect our business by disrupting normal IT operations, customer service, accounting and technology functions, affecting our ability to comply with our financing arrangements and otherwise impacting our ability to manage our business. Disruption, termination or substandard provision of services could be the result of localized conditions (such as power outages, telecommunications failures, fire or explosion), failure of our systems to function as designed, or as the result of events or circumstances of broader geographic impact (such as storms, earthquakes, floods, epidemics, strikes, acts of war, civil unrest 14or terrorist acts). We have incurred such disruptions, which have resulted and could result in further substantial repair or replacement costs and/or data loss or other impediments that affect our ability to run our business. To date these disruptions have not had a material impact on our operations; however, there is no assurance that such impacts will not be material in the future, and such disruptions have in the past and may in the future have the impacts discussed below.Cyber incidents, security breaches and other disruptions in our IT systems have exposed, and in the future could expose, us to liability, litigation and regulatory or other government action, which could result in the loss of existing or potential clients, damage to our brand and reputation, damage to our competitive position and financial loss. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of responding to cyber incidents and security breaches and implementing remediation measures is and could continue to be significant. These financial consequences include the costs associated with obtaining and maintaining cyber insurance.While we work to continuously evaluate our security perimeter to strengthen and enhance our security posture, our efforts may not meet the ever-evolving level of sophistication, volume, persistence and novelty of the threats, or our efforts may not be complete or sufficient to adequately maintain the confidentiality, security, or availability of the data we collect, store and use to operate our business.For information on our cybersecurity risk management, strategy and governance, see Item 1C. - Cybersecurity.A significant portion of our revenue is derived from our installed base. Future results may be adversely impacted if we are unable to maintain our installed base and sell new solutions and related services to existing and new clients. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from our installed base, many of which are subject to long-term contracts. We continue to invest in our solutions to retain and extend our existing client base as well as attract new clients. If legacy clients do not believe in the value provided by our solutions and exit their contracts, or if they choose not to renew their contracts, or not to renew these contracts on terms at least as favorable as the current contracts, our revenue could decline meaningfully and there could be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We could also lose clients because of their merger, acquisition or business failure. We may not be able to replace the revenue and earnings from any such lost client. We are expecting revenue, margin and market share expansion due to our differentiated solutions and the decision by some of our competitors to exit or de-emphasize their focus on our targets markets. If some or all of these competitors focus on our target markets, it could adversely affect our ability to gain market share or otherwise adversely affect future results. Furthermore, if ClearPath Forward is sold in the form of Software as a Service (SaaS) at an accelerated pace, this would have a negative timing impact on our short- and medium-term cash position and could adversely impact our operations, financial condition and liquidity. Additionally, we invest in and sell new solutions and related services. If we invest insufficiently or are unsuccessful in selling these other solutions and related services, there may not be a meaningful return on these investments. Further, the revenues generated by newer solutions and related services may be insufficient to offset any revenue declines caused if we are unable to retain the revenues generated by our installed base.Future results may be materially adversely impacted if we are unable to grow revenue, expand profit margin and generate sufficient cash flows in our businesses.Our strategy places an emphasis on growing revenue, including specifically from higher-value and higher-margin offerings and our ability to profitably grow revenue and generate cash flows in our businesses depends on our ability to win contracts with clients for higher growth and higher-margin solutions. This in turn depends on our ability to offer solutions that meet client needs. It also depends on an efficient utilization of delivery personnel and the ability to meet our clients’ technological needs. Revenue and profit margin in these businesses are a function of both the portfolio of solutions sold and the rates we charge. The rates we charge for our solutions are affected by several factors, including clients’ perception of our ability to add value, introduction of new offerings by us or our alliance partners, market pricing pressure, and general economic conditions such as inflation or an economic downturn, or the perception of the risk of these occurrences. Chargeability is also affected by several factors, including our ability to transition resources from completed projects to new engagements and across geographies, and our ability to forecast demand for services and thereby maintain appropriate resource levels. Our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely impacted if sales of higher-margin offerings do not offset declines in revenue and profitability of lower-margin offerings, including contracts that we voluntarily exit.Our results of operations have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by volatile, negative or uncertain economic and political conditions as well as acts of war, terrorism, natural disasters or the widespread outbreak of infectious diseases.Approximately 56% of our total revenue for 2023 was derived from international operations. Given our global operations, macroeconomic conditions, like foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, currency restrictions and devaluations, increases in inflation rates and weaker intellectual property protections in some jurisdictions, as well as geopolitical conditions affect us, our 15clients’ businesses and the markets they serve. Volatile, negative and uncertain economic and political conditions have in the past, and could in the future, undermine business confidence in markets where we operate or plan to operate, which could cause our clients to reduce, defer or eliminate spending on new initiatives and technologies or existing contracts, both of which could negatively affect our business. Growth in some markets we serve has slowed and could continue to slow, stagnate or contract. The same could occur in other markets where we do business or plant to do business. Because we operate globally and have significant businesses in many markets, an economic slowdown in any of key markets such as in the United States or Europe could adversely affect our results of operations. Ongoing economic and political volatility and uncertainty and changing demand patterns affect our business in several ways, including making it more difficult to accurately forecast client demand and effectively build our revenue and resource plans. Economic and political volatility and uncertainty is particularly challenging because it may take time for the effects and changes in demand patterns resulting from these and other factors to manifest themselves in our business and results of operations. Additionally, our business has been, and can in the future be, adversely impacted by acts of war, terrorism, natural disasters and the widespread outbreak of infectious diseases, like the COVID-19 pandemic, as such events have unpredictable consequences on the world economy and our operations. Changing demand patterns from economic and political volatility and uncertainty, including because of increasing geopolitical tensions, inflation, economic downturns and changes in global trade policies and their impact on us, our clients and the industries we serve, have in the past had a negative impact and could in the future have a significant negative impact on our results of operations.Our inability to effectively anticipate and respond to rapid technological innovation, such as artificial intelligence among others, in our industry could affect our results of operations and cash flows.Our success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to develop and implement services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology and offerings to serve the changing needs of our clients. Our services and solutions are continually evolving because of as machine learning and AI, including generative AI, augmented and virtual reality, automation, Internet of Things, hybrid computing architectures like quantum, high performance and edge computing, infrastructure and network engineering and intelligent connected solutions. As we expand our services and solutions, we may be exposed to operational, legal, regulatory, ethical, technological and other risks specific to these new areas, which may negatively affect our results of operations, cash flows, reputation and demand for our services and solutions. Technological developments may materially affect the cost and use of technology by our clients and, in the case of cloud, data and AI solutions, could affect the nature of how we generate revenue. Some of these technological developments have reduced and replaced some of our historical services and solutions and will continue to do so in the future. This has caused, and may in the future cause, clients to delay spending under existing contracts and delay entering into new contracts while they evaluate new technologies. Furthermore, if we are unable to introduce new pricing or commercial models that reflect the value of technological innovation or if the pace and level of spending on new technological developments are not sufficient to make up any shortfall.Developments in the industries we serve, which may be rapid, could also shift demand to new services and solutions. If, we are unable to offer new services and solutions that match client demand because of changes in the industries we serve, we may be less competitive and need to make significant investment to adapt. For example, if we fail to continue to develop leading machine learning and AI services and solutions, including generative AI, we may lose future opportunities.Our growth strategy focuses on responding to technological developments by driving innovation that will enable us to expand our business into new growth areas. We are applying machine learning and AI to our services, how we deliver work to our clients, and to our own internal operations. AI technologies are complex and rapidly evolving, and we face significant competition, including from our clients, who may develop their own internal AI-related capabilities, which can lead to reduced demand for our services and solutions. If we do not invest in new technology, adapt to industry developments, evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale, or if we do not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments and successfully drive innovation, our services and solutions, our results of operations and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and to execute on our growth strategy could be adversely affected.Our work with government and public sector clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting and public sector environment.A significant amount of our business comes from government and public sector clients. Our clients include national, provincial, state and local government entities, located in a variety of countries. This work carries various inherent risks, including, but not limited to, the right to audit our contract costs and conduct inquiries and investigations of our business practices and compliance with government and public sector contract requirements, such as security clearance, and the inherent limitations of internal controls may not prevent or detect all improper or illegal activities. Negative findings in such audits, investigations or inquiries could affect our future sales and profitability due to a wide range of consequences, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with new and existing government 16and public sector clients. In the ordinary course of business, we have had findings in connection with audits, investigations and inquiries related to government work and public sector clients. We have experienced some adverse consequences, as a result, and may in the future experience further adverse consequences because of our work with government and public sector clients, which could materially affect our future results of operations. Government and public sector clients typically fund projects through appropriated monies. While these projects are often planned and executed as multi-year projects, government and public sector clients usually reserve the right to change the scope of, or terminate these projects for lack of approved funding at their convenience. Changes in government or political developments, including changes in administrations or regimes, government closures or shutdowns, budget deficits, shortfalls or uncertainties, government spending reductions or other debt constraints could result in our projects being reduced in price or scope or terminated altogether, which also could limit our recovery of incurred costs, reimbursable expenses and profits on work completed prior to the termination. Furthermore, if insufficient funding is appropriated to the government or public sector client to cover termination costs, we may not be able to fully recover our investments. Political and economic factors such as pending elections, the outcome of recent elections, changes in leadership among key executive or legislative decision makers, revisions to governmental tax or other policies and reduced tax revenues could affect the number and terms of new government and public sector contracts signed or the speed at which new contracts are signed, decrease future levels of spending and authorizations for programs that we bid, shift spending priorities to programs in areas for which we do not provide services and/or lead to changes in enforcement or how compliance with relevant rules or laws is assessed. The occurrences or conditions described above have had an adverse impact on our results of operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business or our results of operations in the future.If we are unable to maintain our credit rating or access the financing markets, it may adversely impact our business and liquidity. As of December 31, 2023, we had $485 million aggregate principal amount of our 6.875% Senior Secured Notes due November 1, 2027 (the 2027 Notes). Our business may not generate cash flows from operations sufficient to pay off these notes and we expect that we will need to refinance these notes prior to maturity or explore additional sources of debt and/or equity to repay theses notes. The agencies rating our indebtedness regularly evaluate us and determine our credit ratings based on several factors. These factors include our financial strength and ability to generate earnings and cash flows, as well as factors not entirely within our control, such as rising interest rates, conditions affecting the information technology industry and the economy and changes in rating methodologies. A downgrade of our credit ratings could adversely affect our access to liquidity and capital; particularly as we plan to refinance the 2027 Notes prior to maturity, an adverse change in our credit rating could significantly increase our cost of funds, decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us or purchase our securities and impact our ability to utilize surety bonds or other financial instruments we use to run our business. Rising interest rates and other market conditions may also impact our ability to utilize surety bonds, letters of credit, foreign exchange derivatives or other financial instruments we use to conduct our business. These impacts could affect our growth, profitability, and financial condition, including liquidity. If we are unable to access the financing markets, we would be required to use cash on hand to fund operations and our required pension contributions and repay outstanding debt as it comes due. There is no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash to fund our operations, pension contributions and refinance such debt, including because of impaired access to financing markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.If we are unable to align employees and their skills with global client demand around the world and retain and develop employees and management with strong leadership skills, our business may be adversely impacted.Our success is dependent, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain employees with market-leading skills and capabilities like AI and machine learning in line with global client demand. We must reskill, retain and inspire appropriate numbers of talented employees with diverse skills in order to serve our clients, respond quickly to rapid and ongoing changes in demand, technology, industry and the macroeconomic environment, and continuously innovate to grow our business. If we are unable to do so, we may not be able to innovate and deliver new services and solutions to fulfill client demand.In addition, the unionization of certain of our associate populations results in higher costs and unique operational challenges. At certain times and in certain geographical regions, we can find it difficult to attract and retain enough employees with the skills or backgrounds to meet current and/or future demand. In these cases, we may need to redeploy existing employees or increase our reliance on subcontractors to fill certain labor needs. If we are not successful in these initiatives, our results of operations could be adversely affected. If our utilization rate of our employees is too high or too low, it could have an adverse effect on associate engagement and attrition, the quality of the work performed and our ability to staff projects. We are dependent on retaining members of the Unisys management team and other employees with critical capabilities. If we are unable to do so, our ability to innovate, generate new business opportunities and effectively lead large and complex transformations and client relationships could be jeopardized. Our equity-based incentive compensation plans and other variable 17cash compensation programs, as well as promotions, are designed to reward high-performing employees for their contributions and provide incentives for them to remain with us. If the anticipated value of such incentives or the pace of promotions does not materialize because of company performance or volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price, or if our total compensation package is not viewed as being competitive, our ability to attract and retain key employees could be adversely affected. We have been, and expect in the future to be, required to contribute additional cash to meet our significant underfunded defined benefit pension plan obligations, and these contributions could have a material impact on our operations, financial condition and liquidity. We have significant underfunded obligations under our U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. In 2023, we made cash contributions of $42.4 million, primarily for our international defined benefit pension plans. Based on current legislation, global regulations, recent interest rates and expected returns, we estimate cash contributions of approximately $21 million in 2024, primarily for our international defined benefit pension plans. We estimate that cash contributions to our U.S. defined benefit pension plans will begin to increase in 2025, increasing the total estimated contributions for our U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans to approximately $110 million in 2025 and approximately $770 million in the aggregate from 2026 through 2033. Estimates for future cash contributions are likely to change based on several factors including volatility in the capital markets, discount rate changes, asset return changes, or changes in economic or demographic trends. There have been significant increases in forecasted contributions to our U.S. plans and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans in the past and such forecasts can be significantly impacted in the future.If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows from operations to pay the required future cash contributions, we may not be able to obtain additional funding to satisfy these obligations. In such a case, we may be forced to reduce or delay business activities, acquisitions, investments and/or capital expenditures; sell assets; restructure or refinance our indebtedness; or seek additional equity capital, waiver or bankruptcy protection, and we may not be able to effect any of these remedies when necessary, or on satisfactory terms.We face aggressive competition, which could lead to reduced demand for our solutions and related services and could have an adverse effect on our business.Our future performance is largely dependent on our ability to compete successfully and expand in the markets we currently serve. The market in which we operate includes many companies vying for clients and market share both domestically and internationally. Our competitors include systems integrators, consulting and other professional services firms, outsourcing providers, infrastructure services providers, computer hardware manufacturers and software providers. If we are unable to differentiate our offerings from those of our competitors and renew and expand on existing contracts and win new contracts, our revenues may significantly decline. Some of our competitors may develop competing solutions and services that offer better price for performance or that reach the market before our offerings. Some competitors have and may continue to have greater financial and other resources than we have, providing them with the enhanced ability to compete for market share, including by providing significant economic incentives and discounts to secure contracts.Additionally, competitors may generally offer more aggressive pricing or contractual terms, which may affect our ability to win work. Even if we have potential offerings that address marketplace or client needs better than others, competitors may be more successful at selling similar services they offer, including to our clients. Furthermore, some competitors are more established in certain markets, which may make executing our growth strategy to expand in these markets more challenging. Some may be better able to compete for skilled professionals, innovate and/or provide new services and solutions faster than us, or may be able to anticipate the need for services and solutions before we do. Our competitors may also team together to create competing offerings. If we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose market share and clients to competitors, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations. We also may face greater competition due to consolidation of companies in the technology sector through strategic mergers, acquisitions or teaming arrangements. Consolidation activity may result in new competitors with greater scale, a broader footprint or offerings that are more attractive than ours. New services or technologies offered by competitors, our alliance partners or new entrants may make our offerings less differentiated or less competitive when compared to other alternatives, which may adversely affect our businesses and results of operations.Future results depend in part on the pricing, performance and capabilities of third parties with whom we have commercial relationships.We maintain business relationships and transact with our alliance partners, suppliers and other third parties that have complementary solutions, services or skills. Future results will depend, in part, on the pricing, performance and capabilities of these third parties. Inflation may lead to higher labor and other costs charged by these third parties, and supply chain disruptions 18may cause the inability by them to deliver in a timely manner, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Additionally, the financial condition of, and our relationship with, distributors and other indirect partners can impact our ability to serve current and potential clients and end users effectively and efficiently. Our commercial contracts have not been, and in the future may not be, as profitable as expected or provide the expected level of revenue.In many of our long-term solutions and services contracts, revenue is based on the volume of solutions and services provided. As a result, revenue levels anticipated at contract inception are not guaranteed. Some of our contracts may permit termination at the client’s discretion before the end of the contract term or may permit termination or impose other penalties if we do not meet the performance levels specified in the contracts, particularly for government and public sector clients. In addition, from time to time, the company is involved in disputes and legal proceedings with our clients concerning solutions and services that the company has provided. Some of our commercial contracts require customized solutions, features, configurations and functions, and, in such a customized environment, there have been and may continue to be claims for failure to perform. In such cases, we have not, and in the future may not, achieve expected revenue and profit from certain commercial contracts.If we are unable to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, our services or solutions infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others or we lose our ability to utilize the intellectual property of others, our business could be adversely affected.Our success depends, in part, upon our ability to obtain intellectual property protection for our proprietary platforms, methodologies, processes, software, hardware and other solutions. Existing laws of the various countries in which we provide services or solutions may offer only limited intellectual property protection. We rely upon a combination of confidentiality policies and procedures, nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements, and patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights. These laws are subject to change at any time and could further limit our ability to obtain or maintain intellectual property protection. There is uncertainty concerning the scope of patent and other intellectual property protection for software and business methods, which are fields in which we rely on intellectual property laws to protect our rights. Even where we obtain intellectual property protection, our intellectual property rights may not prevent or deter competitors, current or former employees, or other third parties from reverse engineering our solutions or proprietary methodologies and processes or independently developing services or solutions similar to, or duplicative of, ours. Further, the steps we take in this regard might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors, current or former employees or other third parties, and we might not be able to detect unauthorized use of, or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights. For example, we have brought and may continue to bring lawsuits to protect our intellectual property, proprietary and other confidential information. Enforcing our rights requires considerable time, money and oversight, and we may not be successful in enforcing our rights. In addition, we cannot be sure that our services and solutions, including, for example, our software and hardware solutions, or the solutions of others that we offer to our clients, do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties (including competitors as well as non-practicing holders of intellectual property assets), and these third parties could claim that we or our clients are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. Furthermore, although we have established policies and procedures to respect the intellectual property rights of third parties and that prohibit the unauthorized use of intellectual property, we may not be aware if our associates have misappropriated and/or misused intellectual property, and their actions could result in claims of intellectual property misappropriation and/or infringement from third parties. These claims could harm our reputation, cause us to incur substantial costs or prevent us from offering some services or solutions in the future. Any related proceedings could require us to expend significant resources over an extended period of time. In most of our contracts, we agree to indemnify our clients for expenses and liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties used to provide our solutions or perform our services. In some instances, the amount of these indemnities could be greater than the revenues we receive from the client. Any claims or litigation in this area could be time-consuming and costly, damage our reputation and/or require us to incur additional costs to obtain the right to continue to offer a service or solution to our clients. If we cannot secure this right at all or on reasonable terms, or we are unable to implement alternative technology in a cost-effective manner, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected. The risk of infringement claims against us may increase as we expand our business.Further, we rely on third-party software, hardware and other intellectual property in providing some of our services and solutions. If we lose our ability to continue using any such software, hardware or intellectual property for any reason, including because it is found to infringe the rights of others, we will need to obtain substitutes or seek alternative means of obtaining the technology necessary to continue to provide such services and solutions. Our inability to replace such software, hardware or intellectual property effectively or in a timely and cost-effective manner could materially adversely affect our results of operations.19We could face business and financial risk through the completion of acquisitions or dispositions.As part of our business strategy, we have and may acquire complementary technologies, solutions, services and businesses, or dispose of existing technologies, solutions, services and businesses, including transactions of a material size. We may not have the cash sufficient to make such opportunistic acquisitions. Accordingly, any acquisitions may result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness or contingent liabilities. Acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and an increase in amortization expenses related to intangible assets. Potential risks with respect to dispositions include difficulty finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner; potential loss of employees or clients; dispositions at unfavorable prices or on unfavorable terms, including relating to retained liabilities; and post-closing indemnity claims. The risks associated with acquisitions, including integration, and dispositions could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in consummating future acquisitions or dispositions on favorable terms or at all. LEGAL AND REGULATORYOur global operations expose us to numerous and sometimes conflicting legal and regulatory requirements, and violations of these legal and regulatory requirements could harm our business and cause reputational risk.We are subject to numerous, changing, and sometimes conflicting, legal and regulatory regimes on matters as diverse as anticorruption, import/export controls, content requirements, trade restrictions, tariffs, taxation, sanctions, immigration, internal and disclosure control obligations, securities regulation, including ESG regulation and reporting requirements, anti-competition, anti-money-laundering, data privacy and protection such as those in the United States and the European Union with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), government compliance, wage-and-hour standards, employment and labor relations, product liability, health and safety, environmental, human rights and AI regulations. The sanctions environment has resulted in new sanctions and trade restrictions, which may impair trade with sanctioned individuals and countries, and result in negative impacts to regional trade ecosystems among our clients, our alliance partners, and ourselves.The global nature of our operations, including emerging markets where legal and regulatory systems may be less developed or understood by us, and the diverse nature of our operations across several regulated industries, further increases the difficulty of compliance. Compliance with diverse legal or regulatory requirements is costly, time-consuming and requires significant resources. Violations of one or more of these regulations in the conduct of our business or in connection with the performance of our obligations to our clients have occurred and resulted in fines and penalties, claims, money damages and other sanctions, and could result in additional significant fines and penalties, monetary damages, enforcement actions and/or criminal prosecutions or sanctions against us and/or our employees, prohibitions on doing business, restrictions on our ability to carry out our contractual obligations to our clients and damage to our reputation. Due to the varying degrees of development of the legal and regulatory systems of the countries in which we operate, local laws may not be well developed or provide clear guidance or they may be insufficient to protect our rights. In many parts of the world, including countries in which we operate and/or seek to expand, practices in the local business community might not conform to international business standards and could violate anticorruption laws or regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, or economic and trade restrictions administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control. Our employees, alliance partners and third parties, including companies we acquire and their employees, subcontractors, vendors and agents, and other third parties with which we work, could take actions that violate policies or procedures designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance or applicable anticorruption laws or regulations. Violations of these laws or regulations by us, our employees or any of these third parties could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions (whether or not we participated or knew about the actions leading to the violations), including fines or penalties, disgorgement of profits and suspension or disqualification from work, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, including our results of operations and our reputation. Changes in laws and regulations could also mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions or could impose additional taxes on our services and solutions. For example, changes in laws and regulations to limit using off-shore resources in connection with our work or to penalize companies that use off-shore resources, which have been proposed from time to time in various jurisdictions, could adversely affect our results of operations. Such changes may result in contracts being terminated or work being transferred onshore, resulting in greater costs to us, and could have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future work from government clients. In addition, several jurisdictions where we operate have proposed legislation regulating AI and non-personal data that may impose significant requirements on how we design, build and deploy AI and handle non-personal data for ourselves and our clients. For example, some jurisdictions have established extensive new standards for AI safety and security. Other jurisdictions may decide to adopt similar or more restrictive legislation that may render the use of such technologies challenging. These obligations may make it harder for us to conduct our business using AI, lead to regulatory fines or penalties, require us to 20change our solutions and services offerings or business practices, or prevent or limit our use of AI. If we cannot use AI, or that use is restricted, our business may be less efficient, or we may be at a competitive disadvantage. Any of these factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.If we fail again to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, our ability to report timely and accurate financial results or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired, and our business and operating results may be adversely affected.If we fail again to maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, we will not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. If we fail to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment, we could suffer misstatements in our financial statements and fail to meet our reporting obligations, which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and result in significant expenses to remediate.Following the identification during the fourth quarter of 2022 of material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, which has since been remediated, we have expended, and anticipate we will continue to expend, significant resources including accounting-related costs and costs associated with significant management oversight to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting. If any of these new or improved controls and systems do not perform as expected, we may experience material weaknesses in our controls, which could result in material misstatements in our financial statements and a failure to meet our reporting and financial obligations, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. If we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). In addition, testing and maintaining internal controls may divert our management’s attention from other matters that are important to our business.We have received, and may receive in the future, regulatory, investigative and enforcement inquiries, subpoenas or demands arising from, related to, or in connection with these matters, including as disclosed in Note 18, “Litigation and contingencies” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Professional costs resulting from litigation and contingencies have been significant and are expected to continue to be significant, in particular, if litigation costs grow. Although we believe that no significant business has been lost to date, it is possible that a change in the perceptions of our clients could occur as a result. In addition, as a result of the investigation and remediation efforts, certain operational changes have occurred and may continue to occur in the future. Any or all of these could directly or indirectly have a material adverse effect on our operations and/or financial performance.Legal proceedings and environmental matters have and may continue to impact our results of operations and cash flows.Various lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings have been brought or asserted against us relating to matters arising in the ordinary course of business, including actions with respect to commercial and government contracts, labor and employment, employee benefits, intellectual property, environmental, securities, and non-income tax matters. We are also subject to a variety of legal and environmental compliance risk, including with respect to predecessor company operations, which have led or may lead to environmental remedial actions at former or third-party sites. Significant current matters are disclosed in Note 18, “Litigation and contingencies” in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Regardless of the outcome of any individual matter, litigation and environmental matters have impacted and could continue to impact our results of operations, cash flows and business. In addition, legal proceedings or environmental matters may arise in the future with respect to our existing and legacy operations that may adversely affect our business.Failure to meet ESG expectations and standards, achieve our ESG goals, or comply with ESG regulations or laws could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, stock price or reputation.Our ESG goals, commitments, and targets reflect our current plans and aspirations, are based on available data and estimates, and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them. Actions or statements that we may take based on expectations, assumptions, or third-party information that we currently believe to be reasonable may subsequently be determined to be erroneous or be subject to misinterpretation. Initiatives to address ESG issues may be costly and may not have the desired effect. Evolving stakeholder expectations and our efforts and ability to manage these issues and accomplish our goals, commitments, and targets present numerous operational, regulatory, reputational, financial, legal, and other risks, any of which may be outside of our control or could have adverse impacts on our business, including on our stock price.Increasing focus on ESG matters has resulted in, and is expected to continue to result in, the adoption of legal and regulatory requirements designed to mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment, as well as legal and regulatory requirements requiring climate, human rights and supply chain-related disclosures. If new laws or regulations are more stringent than current legal or regulatory requirements, we may experience increased compliance burdens and costs to meet such obligations. In addition, our selection of voluntary disclosure frameworks and standards, and the interpretation or application of 21those frameworks and standards, may change from time to time or may not meet the expectations of investors or other stakeholders. Our ability to achieve our ESG commitments is subject to numerous risks, many of which are outside of our control. Examples of such risks include: (1) the availability and cost of low- or non-carbon-based energy sources and technologies; (2) evolving regulatory requirements affecting ESG standards or disclosures; (3) the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability, diversity and other standards; and (4) our ability to recruit, develop, and retain diverse talent. In addition, standards for tracking and reporting on ESG matters, including climate change and human rights related matters, have not been harmonized and continue to evolve. Methodologies for reporting ESG data may be updated and previously reported ESG data may be adjusted to reflect improvement in availability and quality of third-party data, changing assumptions, changes in the nature and scope of our operations, and other changes in circumstances. Our processes and controls for reporting ESG matters across our operations are evolving along with multiple disparate standards for identifying, measuring, and reporting ESG metrics, including ESG and climate-related disclosures that may soon be required by the SEC, the new California climate legislation and European Union climate legislation, which could result in significant revisions to our current goals, reported progress in achieving such goals, or ability to achieve such goals in the future.ACCOUNTINGOur ability to use our net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited. As of December 31, 2023, we had $1.7 billion in U.S. federal NOL carryforwards, for which we currently maintain a full valuation allowance. A corporation’s ability to deduct its U.S. federal NOL carryforwards and utilize certain other available tax attributes can be substantially constrained under the general annual limitation rules of Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (Section 382) if it undergoes an “ownership change” as defined in Section 382 (generally where cumulative stock ownership changes among material shareholders exceed 50 percent during a rolling three-year period). Similar rules may apply under state tax laws. A future tax “ownership change” pursuant to Section 382 or future changes in tax laws that impose tax attribute utilization limitations may severely limit or effectively eliminate our ability to utilize our NOL carryforwards and other tax attributes. Impairment of goodwill or intangible assets may negatively impact our results of operations. On an annual basis, and whenever circumstances arise, we review goodwill and intangible assets for impairment. The impairment test is based on several factors, estimates and assumptions, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market consideration, overall financial performance, market capitalization and relevant entity-specific events. Significant changes to these factors could impact the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of goodwill or intangible assets and may indicate potential impairment. An impairment of a significant portion of our goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our results of operations.Other factors discussed in this report, although not listed here, also could materially affect our future results.22"
1,UIS,UNISYS CORP,2023-03-01,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSFactors that could affect future results include the following:IMPLEMENTATION OF BUSINESS STRATEGY IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY MARKETFuture results may be adversely impacted if we are unable to grow revenue and expand margin in our Digital Workplace Solutions and Cloud, Applications & Infrastructure Solutions businesses.Our strategy places an emphasis on growing revenue, including specifically from higher-value and higher-margin offerings in our Digital Workplace Solutions and Cloud, Applications & Infrastructure Solutions businesses. Our ability to grow revenue and profitability in these businesses will depend our ability to win contracts with clients for higher growth and higher-margin user experience-based solutions, which in turn depends on our ability to offer differentiated solutions that meet client needs. It will also depend on an efficient utilization of delivery personnel. Revenue and profit margins in these businesses are a function of both the portfolio of solutions sold and the rates we are able to charge for solutions. The rates we are able to charge for our solutions are affected by a number of factors, including clients’ perception of our ability to add value through our solutions, introduction of new offerings by us or our partner eco-system, market pricing pressure, and general economic conditions such as inflation or an economic downturn, or the perception of the risk of these occurrences. Chargeability is also affected by a number of factors, including our ability to transition resources from completed projects to new engagements and across geographies, and our ability to forecast demand for services and thereby maintain appropriate resource levels. Our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely impacted if sales of higher-margin offerings do not offset declines in revenue and profitability of lower-margin offerings, including lower-margin contracts that we voluntarily exit.Future results may be adversely impacted if we are unable to maintain our installed base and sell new solutions and related services.We continue to invest in our ClearPath Forward operating system software in order to retain and extend our existing client base included in our Enterprise Computing Solutions business. If clients do not believe in the value proposition provided by ClearPath Forward or choose not to renew their contracts, there may not be a meaningful return on these investments, and revenue could decline meaningfully. Furthermore, if ClearPath Forward is sold in the form of Software as a Service (SaaS) at an accelerated pace, this would have a negative impact on our short- and medium-term cash position and could adversely impact our operations, financial condition and liquidity. Additionally, we also continue to invest in other software and solutions and related services. If we are unsuccessful in selling these other solutions and related services, there may not be a meaningful return on these investments. Further, the revenues generated by other solutions and related services may be insufficient to offset any revenue declines caused if we are unable to retain our installed base.If we are unable to attract and retain experienced personnel in key positions, our future results could be adversely impacted.Our ability to retain, train and develop our existing associate base in the skills and solutions required to service our clients is critical to our future success.  We also need to attract new talent to augment the skills required to deliver our solutions to our clients. Our failure to retain, train and develop existing personnel or attract new talent with the requisite skill set, retain key personnel or implement an appropriate succession plan for such personnel could adversely impact our ability to successfully carry out our business strategy.We face aggressive competition, which could lead to reduced demand for our solutions and related services and could have an adverse effect on our business.The market in which we operate includes a large number of companies vying for customers and market share both domestically and internationally. Our competitors include systems integrators, consulting and other professional services firms, outsourcing providers, infrastructure services providers, computer hardware manufacturers and software providers. If we are unable to differentiate our offerings from those of our competitors and renew existing contracts and win new contracts, our revenues may decline. Some of our competitors may develop competing services and products that offer better price for performance or that reach the market in advance of our offerings. Some competitors also have or may develop greater financial and other resources than us, providing them with the enhanced ability to compete for market share, in some instances through significant economic incentives to secure contracts. Some also may be better able to compete for skilled professionals. Any of these factors could lead to reduced demand for our solutions and related services and could have an adverse effect on our business. Future results will depend on our ability to mitigate the effects of aggressive competition on revenues, pricing and margins.Our future results may be adversely impacted if we are unable to effectively anticipate and respond to rapid technological innovation in our industry.14We operate in an industry characterized by rapid technological innovation, evolving technology standards, short product life cycles and continually changing customer demand patterns. Future success will depend in part on our ability to anticipate and respond to these market trends and to design, develop, introduce, deliver or obtain new and innovative services and products on a timely and cost-effective basis using newer delivery models. Additionally, we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to changes in technology, industry standards or customer preferences, and the market may not demand or accept our services and product offerings. In addition, services and products developed by competitors may make our offerings less competitive.Our future results will depend on our ability to retain significant clients and attract new clients.We have a number of significant long-term contracts with clients, including governmental entities, and our future success will depend, in part, on retaining our relationships with these clients and attracting new clients. We could lose clients for reasons such as contract expiration, conversion to a competing service provider, disputes with clients or a decision to in-source services.  We could also lose clients as a result of their merger, acquisition or business failure. We may not be able to replace the revenue and earnings from any such lost client.  We are expecting revenue, margin and market share expansion due to our differentiated solutions and the decisions by some of our competitors to exit or de-emphasize their focus on our target markets. If such competitors change that position, it could impact our ability to gain market share. Our contracts may not be as profitable as expected or provide the expected level of revenues.In a number of our long-term services contracts, our revenue is based on the volume of services and products provided. As a result, revenue levels anticipated at contract inception are not guaranteed. Our contracts with governmental entities are subject to the availability of appropriated funds and appropriations may be delayed or may not be made at all. Further, appropriations are subject to many different factors, including budget priorities, economic cycles, change in political administrations and other circumstances beyond our control that may impact our revenues from government contracts.  In addition, some of our contracts may permit termination at the customer’s discretion before the end of the contract term or may permit termination or impose other penalties if we do not meet the performance levels specified in the contracts.Some of our services contracts are fixed-price contracts under which we assume the risk for delivery of the contracted services and products at an agreed-upon fixed price. Should we experience problems in performing fixed-price contracts on a profitable basis, adjustments to the estimated cost to complete may be required and may or may not be obtained. Future results will depend on our ability to perform these services contracts profitably.We could face business and financial risk in implementing acquisitions or dispositions.As part of our business strategy, we may from time to time acquire complementary technologies, products and businesses, or dispose of existing technologies, products and businesses, including transactions of a material size. Any acquisitions may result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness or contingent liabilities. Acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and an increase in amortization expenses related to intangible assets. Additional potential risks associated with acquisitions include technical, cultural and operational integration challenges; difficulties in maintaining or enhancing the profitability of any acquired business; risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience; potential loss of employees or failure to maintain or renew any contracts of any acquired business; and expenses of any undiscovered or potential liabilities of the acquired product or business, including relating to employee benefits contribution obligations or environmental requirements. Potential risks with respect to dispositions include difficulty finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner; potential loss of employees or clients; dispositions at unfavorable prices or on unfavorable terms, including relating to retained liabilities; and post-closing indemnity claims. Further, with respect to both acquisitions and dispositions, management’s attention could be diverted from other business concerns. Adverse credit conditions could also affect our ability to consummate acquisitions or dispositions. The risks associated with acquisitions and dispositions could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in consummating future acquisitions or dispositions on favorable terms or at all. 15DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANSWe have significant underfunded pension obligations. We have significant underfunded obligations under our U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. In 2022, we made cash contributions of $39.3 million, primarily for our international defined benefit pension plans.  Based on current legislation, global regulations, recent interest rates and expected returns, in 2023 we expect to make cash contributions of approximately $40 million, primarily for our international defined benefit pension plans. Based upon our most current estimates as of December 31, 2022, we do not expect to make mandatory cash contributions to our U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans until 2025. Estimates for future cash contributions are likely to change based on a number of factors including market conditions and changes in discount rates. We may need to obtain additional funding in order to make future contributions. In this event, there is no assurance that we would be able to obtain such funding or that we will have enough cash on hand to pay the required cash contributions. Deterioration in the value of our worldwide defined benefit pension plan assets, as well as discount rate changes, asset return changes, or changes in economic or demographic trends, could require us to make cash contributions to our defined benefit pension plans in the future in an amount larger than currently anticipated. Increased cash contribution requirements or an acceleration in the due date of such cash contributions would further reduce the cash available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate uses and may worsen the adverse impact on our operations, financial condition and liquidity. GENERAL BUSINESS RISKSCybersecurity incidents have occurred and may continue to occur and could result in the incurrence of significant costs and harm to our business and reputation.Our business includes managing, processing, storing and transmitting proprietary and confidential data, including personal information, intellectual property and proprietary business information, within our own IT systems and those that we design, develop, host or manage for clients. These systems are critical to our business activities, and unauthorized access to or disruptions of, and cybersecurity attacks on, these systems pose increasing risks. Like other companies, we have experienced cybersecurity attacks and have had to expend increasing human and financial resources to respond. Cyberattacks from computer hackers and cyber criminals and other malicious internet-based activity continue to increase generally, and our services and systems, including the systems of our outsourced service providers, have been and may in the future continue to be the target of various forms of cybersecurity incidents such as DNS attacks, wireless network attacks, viruses and worms, malicious software, ransomware, cyber extortion, misconfigurations, supply chain attacks, application centric attacks, peer-to-peer attacks, phishing attempts, backdoor trojans and distributed denial of service attacks, among other cybersecurity threats. Attacks also may include social engineering and cyber extortion to induce customers, contractors, business partners, vendors, employees and other third parties to disclose information, transfer funds, or unwittingly provide access to systems or data. As a known provider of IT solutions, we pose an attractive target for such attacks.The techniques used by computer hackers and cyber criminals to obtain unauthorized access to data or to sabotage computer systems change frequently and are growing in sophistication, and these new techniques may not be detected until after an incident has occurred. Despite established security controls, cybersecurity incidents involving our systems could result in disruption of our services, misappropriation, misuse, alteration, theft, loss, corruption, leakage, falsification, and accidental or premature release or improper disclosure or misuse of confidential or other information, including intellectual property, personal information, and other confidential information (of the company, third parties, employees, clients or others). We could be exposed to liability, litigation, and regulatory or other government action, as well as the loss of existing or potential customers, damage to our brand and reputation, damage to our competitive position, and other financial loss, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of responding to cybersecurity incidents and implementing remediation measures could be significant. In our industry, security vulnerabilities are increasingly discovered, publicized and exploited across a broad range of hardware, software or other infrastructure, elevating the risk of attacks and the potential cost of response and remediation for us.Although we continuously take significant steps to mitigate cybersecurity risk across a range of functions, such measures can never eliminate the risk entirely or provide absolute security, and we have experienced and expect to continue to experience cyberattacks on our information systems.The failure of our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures to be effective and the potential for material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our financial statements.16Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, our management is required to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to attest to, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The rules governing the standards that must be met for management to assess our internal control over financial reporting are complex and require significant documentation, testing and possible remediation. Annually, we perform activities that include reviewing, documenting and testing our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal control over financial reporting, we will not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. If we fail to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment, we could suffer misstatements in our financial statements and fail to meet our reporting obligations, which would likely cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information. This could result in significant expenses to remediate any internal control deficiencies and lead to a decline in our stock price.Following an investigation by our Audit & Finance Committee into our internal control environment, during the fourth quarter of 2022, we reevaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting and identified material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In response to these material weaknesses, management implemented remedial actions to improve controls, which included enhancing our written policy regarding information escalation for cyber-incidents, enhancing our disclosure committee, and other measures described under “Status of Remediation Plan for Material Weaknesses” in the “Report of Management” subsection of “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10K). Management anticipates that the new controls, as implemented and when tested for a sufficient period of time, will remediate the material weaknesses. However, due to the timing of the design and implementation of our remediation efforts during the fourth quarter of 2022, there has been insufficient time for us to demonstrate consistent execution against all newly implemented actions.  As such, management is unable to determine whether the implemented remedial actions are operating effectively at December 31, 2022, and as a result, management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2022. We expect to continue to enhance our internal controls and assess our operating effectiveness in 2023.We may nevertheless be unsuccessful in remediating the material weaknesses identified by management, or we may be unable to identify and remediate additional control deficiencies, including material weaknesses, in the future. If not remediated, our failure to establish and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our financial statements and a failure to meet our reporting and financial obligations, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and the trading price of our common stock.We have received, and may receive in the future, regulatory, investigative and enforcement inquiries, subpoenas or demands arising from, related to, or in connection with these matters. Professional costs resulting from the investigation that resulted in the identification of the material weaknesses have been significant and are expected to continue to be significant, in particular if litigation costs relating to these regulatory, investigative and enforcement inquiries, subpoenas and demands grow. Although we believe that no significant business has been lost to date, it is possible that a change in the perceptions of our business partners could occur as a result of the investigation and the material weaknesses. In addition, as a result of the investigation and remediation efforts, certain operational changes have occurred and may continue to occur in the future. Any or all of these impacts based on the findings of the investigation and related matters and the surrounding circumstances could exacerbate the other risks described herein and directly or indirectly have a material adverse effect on our operations and/or financial performance.If we are unable to access the financing markets, it may adversely impact our business and liquidity. Market conditions may impact our ability to access the financing markets on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are unable to access the financing markets, we would be required to use cash on hand to fund operations and our required pension contributions and repay outstanding debt as it comes due. There is no assurance that we will generate sufficient cash to fund our operations and required pension contributions and refinance such debt. A failure by us to generate such cash would have a material adverse effect on our business if we were unable to access financing markets and may result in a default with respect to our pension obligation and under our debt agreements. Market conditions may also impact our ability to utilize surety bonds, letters of credit, foreign exchange derivatives or other financial instruments we use to conduct our business.17A significant portion of our revenue is derived from international operations, and we are subject to the risks of doing business internationally.A significant amount of our total revenue is derived from international operations. The risks of doing business internationally include foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, changing and increasingly more stringent global data privacy regulations, currency restrictions and devaluations, changes in political or economic conditions, increases in inflation rate, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, multiple and possibly overlapping and conflicting tax laws, new tax legislation, weaker intellectual property protections in some jurisdictions and additional legal and regulatory compliance requirements applicable to businesses that operate internationally, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, regulations in the European Union such as the General Data Protection Regulation, the U.K. Bribery Act and other U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations.Our business may be adversely affected by global economic conditions, acts of war, terrorism, natural disasters or the widespread outbreak of infectious diseases.If global economic conditions deteriorate, or clients anticipate that they could deteriorate, we could see reductions in demand and increased pressure on revenue and profit margins. We could also see a further consolidation of clients, which could also result in a decrease in demand. Our business could also be affected by acts of war, terrorism, natural disasters and the widespread outbreak of infectious diseases. Geopolitical conditions could escalate, and this could have unpredictable consequences on the world economy and on our business.  If, as a result of such an event, our clients in a particular industry were to suffer material adverse impacts, we may experience a reduction in demand for our services and products from such clients, which may materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.A reduction in our credit rating could adversely affect our business and/or the holders of our securities.The credit rating agencies rating our indebtedness regularly evaluate us, and credit ratings are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and ability to generate earnings, as well as factors not entirely within our control, including conditions affecting the information technology industry and the economy and changes in rating methodologies. There can be no assurance that we will maintain our current credit ratings. A downgrade of our credit ratings could adversely affect our access to liquidity and capital, and could significantly increase our cost of funds, decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us or purchase our securities and impact our ability to utilize surety bonds or other financial instruments we use to conduct our business. This could affect our growth, profitability, and financial condition, including liquidity.A significant disruption in our IT systems could adversely affect our business and reputation.We rely extensively on our IT systems to conduct our business and perform services for our clients. Our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, computer viruses and malicious attacks, cybersecurity breaches and catastrophic events. If our systems are accessed without our authorization, damaged or fail to function properly, we could incur substantial repair or replacement costs, experience data loss and impediments to our ability to conduct our business, and damage the market’s perception of our services and products. In addition, a disruption could result in our failure to meet performance standards and obligations in our client contracts, which could subject us to liability, penalties and contract termination. This may adversely affect our reputation and financial results.Future results will depend in part on the performance and capabilities of third parties with whom we have commercial relationships.We maintain business relationships with key partners, suppliers, channel partners and other parties that have complementary products, services or skills. Future results will depend, in part, on the performance and capabilities of these third parties, on the ability of external suppliers to deliver components at reasonable prices and in a timely manner, and on the financial condition of, and our relationship with, distributors and other indirect channel partners, which can affect our capacity to effectively and efficiently serve current and potential customers and end users. Additionally, cost inflation and supply chain disruptions may lead to higher labor and other costs, as well as an inability to procure products needed to deliver our solutions, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Our reputation and relationship with our clients are critical to our business and any harm to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our future revenue and profitability.18The success of our business is dependent on strong, long-term client relationships and on our reputation for responsiveness and quality. As a result, if a client is not satisfied with our services or products, our reputation could be damaged and our business adversely affected. Allegations by private litigants or regulators of improper conduct, as well as negative publicity and press speculation about us, whatever the outcome and whether or not valid, may harm our reputation. In addition to harm to reputation, if we fail to meet our contractual obligations, we could be subject to legal liability, which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.Our services or products may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others.We cannot be sure that our services and products do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, and we may have infringement claims asserted against us or against our clients. These claims could cost us money, prevent us from offering some services or products, or damage our reputation.Legal proceedings could affect our results of operations or cash flow or may adversely affect our business or reputation.Various lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings have been brought or asserted against us in the past relating to matters arising in the ordinary course of business, including actions with respect to commercial and government contracts, labor and employment, employee benefits, environmental matters, securities matters, intellectual property and non-income tax matters. We believe that we have valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against us. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, however, and it is possible that our results of operations or cash flows could be materially affected in any particular period as a result of future developments of the legal matters pending against us, including the resolution of any such matters. In addition, legal proceedings or environmental matters may arise in the future with respect to our existing and legacy operations that may adversely affect our business or reputation.Impairment of goodwill or intangible assets may negatively impact our results of operations. On an annual basis, and whenever circumstances arise, we review goodwill and intangible assets for impairment. The impairment test is based on several factors, estimates and assumptions, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market consideration, overall financial performance, market capitalization and relevant entity-specific events. Significant changes to these factors could impact the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of goodwill or intangible assets and may indicate potential impairment. An impairment of a significant portion of our goodwill or intangible assets could adversely affect our results of operations.A failure to meet standards or expectations with respect to our environmental, social and governance practices could adversely impact our business and reputation.Many governmental bodies and current and prospective investors, clients, partners, and employees are increasing their focus on corporate environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices.  If we fail to meet the standards or expectations of any of these groups, we may suffer reputational damage, our business may be adversely impacted and we may find it more difficult to recruit or retain key personnel.Our ability to use our net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.                                   A corporation’s ability to deduct its federal NOL carryforwards and utilize certain other available tax attributes can be substantially constrained under the general annual limitation rules of Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (Section 382) if it undergoes an “ownership change” as defined in Section 382 (generally where cumulative stock ownership changes among material shareholders exceed 50 percent during a rolling three-year period).  Similar rules may apply under state tax laws.  A future tax “ownership change” pursuant to Section 382 or future changes in tax laws that impose tax attribute utilization limitations may severely limit or effectively eliminate our ability to utilize our NOL carryforwards and other tax attributes. Other factors discussed in this report, although not listed here, also could materially affect our future results.19"
2,UIS,UNISYS CORP,2022-02-22,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSFactors that could affect future results include the following:IMPLEMENTATION OF BUSINESS STRATEGY IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY MARKETIf the company is unable to attract and retain experienced personnel in key positions, its future results could be adversely impacted.The company’s ability to retain, train and develop its existing associate base in the skills and solutions required to service its target markets with the appropriate solutions is critical to the company’s future success.  The company also needs to attract new talent to augment the skills required to deliver its solutions to its target markets.

If the company is unable to attain sufficient rates and chargeability for its professionals, revenue and profit margins will be adversely affected. The rates the company is able to charge for services are affected by a number of factors, including clients’ perception of the company’s ability to add value through its services; introduction of new services or products by the company or its competitors; pricing policies of competitors; and general economic conditions including increased risk of inflation.

Furthermore, if ClearPath Forward is sold in the form of Software as a Service (SaaS) at an accelerated pace, this would have a negative impact on the company’s short- and medium-term cash position and could adversely impact the company’s operations, financial condition and liquidity. Additionally, the company also continues to invest in other software and solutions and related services. If the company is unsuccessful in selling these other solutions and related services, there may not be a meaningful return on these investments. Further, the revenues generated by other solutions and related services may be insufficient to offset any revenue declines caused if the company is unable to retain its installed base.The company could face business and financial risk in implementing acquisitions or dispositions.As part of the company’s business strategy, it may from time to time consider acquiring complementary technologies, products and businesses, or disposing of existing technologies, products and businesses, including transactions of a material size. Any acquisitions may result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness or contingent liabilities. Acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and an increase in amortization expenses related to intangible assets. Additional potential risks associated with acquisitions include technical, cultural and operational integration challenges; difficulties in maintaining or enhancing the profitability of any acquired business; risks of entering markets in which the company has no or limited prior experience; potential loss of employees or failure to maintain or renew any contracts of any acquired business; and expenses of any undiscovered or potential liabilities of the acquired product or business, including relating to employee benefits contribution obligations or environmental requirements. Potential risks with respect to dispositions include difficulty finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner; potential loss of employees or clients; dispositions at unfavorable prices or on unfavorable terms, including relating to retained liabilities; and 12post-closing indemnity claims. Further, with respect to both acquisitions and dispositions, management’s attention could be diverted from other business concerns. Adverse credit conditions could also affect the company’s ability to consummate acquisitions or dispositions. The risks associated with acquisitions and dispositions could have a material adverse effect upon the company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that the company will be successful in consummating future acquisitions or dispositions on favorable terms or at all. The company faces aggressive competition in the information services and technology market, which could lead to reduced demand for the company’s solutions and related services and could have an adverse effect on the company’s business.The information services and technology markets in which the company operates include a large number of companies vying for customers and market share both domestically and internationally. The company’s competitors include systems integrators, consulting and other professional services firms, outsourcing providers, infrastructure services providers, computer hardware manufacturers and software providers. Some of the company’s competitors may develop competing services and products that offer better price-performance or that reach the market in advance of the company’s offerings. Some competitors also have or may develop greater financial and other resources than the company, with enhanced ability to compete for market share, in some instances through significant economic incentives to secure contracts. Some also may be better able to compete for skilled professionals. Any of these factors could lead to reduced demand for the company’s solutions and related services and could have an adverse effect on the company’s business. Future results will depend on the company’s ability to mitigate the effects of aggressive competition on revenues, pricing and margins.The company’s future results may be adversely impacted if it is unable to effectively anticipate and respond to rapid technological innovation in its industry.The company operates in an industry characterized by rapid technological innovation, evolving technology standards, short product life cycles and continually changing customer demand patterns. Future success will depend in part on the company’s ability to anticipate and respond to these market trends and to design, develop, introduce, deliver or obtain new and innovative services and products on a timely and cost-effective basis using newer delivery models such as cloud computing. Additionally, the company may not be successful in anticipating or responding to changes in technology, industry standards or customer preferences, and the market may not demand or accept its services and product offerings. In addition, services and products developed by competitors may make the company’s offerings less competitive.The company’s future results will depend on its ability to retain significant clients and attract new clients.The company has a number of significant long-term contracts with clients, including governmental entities, and its future success will depend, in part, on retaining its relationships with these clients and attracting new clients. The company could lose clients for reasons such as contract expiration, conversion to a competing service provider, disputes with clients or a decision to in-source services.  The company could also lose clients as a result of their merger, acquisition or business failure. The company may not be able to replace the revenue and earnings from any such lost client.  The company is expecting revenue, margin and market share expansion due to decisions by some of the company’s competitors to exit or de-emphasize their focus on the company’s target markets. If such competitors’ change that position, it could impact the company’s ability to gain market share. The company’s contracts may not be as profitable as expected or provide the expected level of revenues.In a number of the company’s long-term services contracts, the company’s revenue is based on the volume of services and products provided. As a result, revenue levels anticipated at contract inception are not guaranteed. The company’s contracts with governmental entities are subject to the availability of appropriated funds.  In addition, some of these contracts may permit termination at the customer’s discretion before the end of the contract term or may permit termination or impose other penalties if the company does not meet the performance levels specified in the contracts.Some of the company’s services contracts are fixed-price contracts under which the company assumes the risk for delivery of the contracted services and products at an agreed-upon fixed price. Should the company experience problems in performing fixed-price contracts on a profitable basis, adjustments to the estimated cost to complete may be required. Future results will depend on the company’s ability to perform these services contracts profitably.13The inability of the company to develop or acquire the capabilities to enhance the company’s solutions could adversely impact the company’s revenue and margins and result in the failure to expand the company’s market share.The company’s financial objectives require it to develop, acquire or orchestrate with its strategic partnership network the prerequisite capabilities to enhance the company’s solutions so they contain higher-growth, higher-margin offerings and allow for the expansion of market share.  If the company is unable to do so, its financial performance may be adversely impacted. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANSThe company has significant underfunded pension obligations. The company has significant underfunded obligations under its U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. In 2021, the company made cash contributions of $52.4 million, primarily for its international defined benefit pension plans.  Based on current legislation, global regulations, recent interest rates and expected returns, in 2022 the company expects to make cash contributions of approximately $40.2 million, primarily for its international defined benefit pension plans. Estimates for future cash contributions are likely to change based on a number of factors including market conditions and changes in discount rates. If estimates for future contributions change materially, the company may need to obtain additional funding in order to make future contributions. In this event, there is no assurance that the company would be able to obtain such funding or that the company will have enough cash on hand to pay the required cash contributions. Deterioration in the value of the company’s worldwide defined benefit pension plan assets, as well as discount rate changes, asset return changes, or changes in economic or demographic trends, could require the company to make cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in the future in an amount larger than currently anticipated. Increased cash contribution requirements or an acceleration in the due date of such cash contributions would further reduce the cash available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate uses and may worsen the adverse impact on the company’s operations, financial condition and liquidity. GENERAL BUSINESS RISKSThe company’s business, results of operations and financial condition have been and will continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and such impact could be materially adverse.Since March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains and workforces and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the company’s operational and financial performance, including the company’s ability to execute its business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, will depend on numerous factors that are uncertain and difficult to predict, including the duration, severity and spread of the pandemic and related restrictions on travel and transportation; the emergence of new variants; the imposition of vaccine mandates and government lockdowns; the effect on the company’s clients and demand for the company’s products and services; the company’s ability to sell and provide its products and services as a result of travel restrictions and people working from home; the ability of the company’s clients to pay for its services and solutions; and any closures of the company’s and its clients’ offices and facilities.  Continued impacts of the pandemic could materially adversely impact global economic conditions, the company’s business, results of operations and financial condition, including the company’s cash flow and liquidity, the company’s potential to conduct financings on terms acceptable to it, if at all, and may require significant actions in response, including but not limited to expense reductions or discounting of pricing of the company’s products, in an effort to mitigate such impacts. The situation with COVID-19 is constantly evolving and additional impacts may arise of which the company is not aware currently.Future results will depend in part on the performance and capabilities of third parties with whom the company has commercial relationships.The company maintains business relationships with key partners, suppliers, channel partners and other parties that have complementary products, services or skills. Future results will depend, in part, on the performance and capabilities of these third parties, on the ability of external suppliers to deliver components at reasonable prices and in a timely manner, and on the financial condition of, and the company’s relationship with, distributors and other indirect channel partners, which can affect the company’s capacity to effectively and efficiently serve current and potential customers and end users. Additionally, cost inflation and supply chain disruptions may lead to higher labor and other costs, as well as an inability to procure products needed to deliver the company’s solutions, which could adversely affect its results of operations. 14Cybersecurity breaches could result in the company incurring significant costs and could harm the company’s business and reputation.The company’s business includes managing, processing, storing and transmitting proprietary and confidential data, including personal information, intellectual property and proprietary business information, within the company’s own IT systems and those that the company designs, develops, hosts or manages for clients. Cybersecurity breaches involving these systems by hackers, other third parties or the company’s employees, despite established security controls, could disrupt these systems or result in the loss or corruption of data or the unauthorized disclosure or misuse of information of the company, its clients or others. This could result in claims, investigations, litigation and legal liability for the company, lead to the loss of existing or potential clients and adversely affect the market’s perception of the security and reliability of the company’s services and products. In addition, such breaches could subject the company to fines and penalties for violations of laws and result in the company incurring other significant costs. This may negatively impact the company’s reputation and financial results.A failure to meet standards or expectations with respect to the company’s environmental, social and governance practices could adversely impact the company’s business and reputation.Many governmental bodies and current and prospective investors, clients, partners, and employees are increasing their focus on corporate environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices.  If the company fails to meet the standards or expectations of any of these groups, the company may suffer reputational damage, the company’s business may be adversely impacted and the company may find it more difficult to recruit or retain key personnel.A significant portion of the company’s revenue is derived from operations outside of the United States, and the company is subject to the risks of doing business internationally.A significant amount of the company’s total revenue is derived from international operations. The risks of doing business internationally include foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, changing global data privacy regulations, currency restrictions and devaluations, changes in political or economic conditions, increases in inflation rate, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, multiple and possibly overlapping and conflicting tax laws, new tax legislation, weaker intellectual property protections in some jurisdictions and additional legal and regulatory compliance requirements applicable to businesses that operate internationally, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, regulations in the European Union such as the General Data Protection Regulation, the U.K. Bribery Act and other U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations.If the company is unable to access the financing markets, it may adversely impact the company’s business and liquidity. Market conditions may impact the company’s ability to access the financing markets on terms acceptable to the company or at all. If the company is unable to access the financing markets, the company would be required to use cash on hand to fund operations and the company’s required pension contributions and repay outstanding debt as it comes due. There is no assurance that the company will generate sufficient cash to fund its operations and required pension contributions and refinance such debt. A failure by the company to generate such cash would have a material adverse effect on its business if the company were unable to access financing markets and may result in a default with respect to the company’s pension obligation and under the company’s debt agreements. Market conditions may also impact the company’s ability to utilize surety bonds, letters of credit, foreign exchange derivatives or other financial instruments the company uses to conduct its business.A reduction in the company’s credit rating could adversely affect its business and/or the holders of its securities.The credit rating agencies rating the company’s indebtedness regularly evaluate the company, and credit ratings are based on a number of factors, including the company’s financial strength and ability to generate earnings, as well as factors not entirely within the company’s control, including conditions affecting the information technology industry and the economy and changes in rating methodologies. There can be no assurance that the company will maintain its current credit ratings. A downgrade of the company’s credit ratings could adversely affect its access to liquidity and capital, and could significantly increase its cost of funds, decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to the company or purchase its securities and impact the company’s ability to utilize surety bonds or other financial instruments the company uses to conduct its business. This could affect the company’s growth, profitability, and financial condition, including liquidity.The company’s business may be adversely affected by global economic conditions, acts of war, terrorism, natural disasters or the widespread outbreak of infectious diseases.If global economic conditions deteriorate, the company could see reductions in demand and increased pressure on revenue and profit margins. The company could also see a further consolidation of clients, which could also result in a decrease in demand. 15The company’s business could also be affected by acts of war, terrorism, natural disasters and the widespread outbreak of infectious diseases. Geopolitical conditions could escalate, and this could have unpredictable consequences on the world economy and on the company’s business.  If, as a result of such an event, the company’s clients in a particular industry were to suffer material adverse impacts, the company may experience a reduction in demand for its services and products from such clients, which may materially and adversely affect the company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.A significant disruption in the company’s IT systems could adversely affect the company’s business and reputation.The company relies extensively on its IT systems to conduct its business and perform services for its clients. The company’s systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, computer viruses and malicious attacks, cybersecurity breaches and catastrophic events. If the company’s systems are accessed without its authorization, damaged or fail to function properly, the company could incur substantial repair or replacement costs, experience data loss and impediments to its ability to conduct its business, and damage the market’s perception of the company’s services and products. In addition, a disruption could result in the company failing to meet performance standards and obligations in its client contracts, which could subject the company to liability, penalties and contract termination. This may adversely affect the company’s reputation and financial results.The company may face damage to its reputation or legal liability if its clients are not satisfied with its services or products.The success of the company’s business is dependent on strong, long-term client relationships and on its reputation for responsiveness and quality. As a result, if a client is not satisfied with the company’s services or products, its reputation could be damaged and its business adversely affected. Allegations by private litigants or regulators of improper conduct, as well as negative publicity and press speculation about the company, whatever the outcome and whether or not valid, may harm its reputation. In addition to harm to reputation, if the company fails to meet its contractual obligations, it could be subject to legal liability, which could adversely affect its business, operating results and financial condition.The company’s services or products may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others.The company cannot be sure that its services and products do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, and it may have infringement claims asserted against it or against its clients. These claims could cost the company money, prevent it from offering some services or products, or damage its reputation.Legal proceedings could affect the company’s results of operations or cash flow or may adversely affect the company’s business or reputation.Various lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings have been brought or asserted against the company in the past relating to matters arising in the ordinary course of business, including actions with respect to commercial and government contracts, labor and employment, employee benefits, environmental matters, intellectual property and non-income tax matters. The company believes that it has valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against it. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, however, and it is possible that the company’s results of operations or cash flows could be materially affected in any particular period as a result of future developments of the legal matters pending against it, including the resolution of any such matters. In addition, legal proceedings or environmental matters may arise in the future with respect to the company’s existing and legacy operations that may adversely affect the company’s business or reputation.TAX ASSETSThe company’s ability to use its net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.                                   A corporation’s ability to deduct its federal NOL carryforwards and utilize certain other available tax attributes can be substantially constrained under the general annual limitation rules of Section 382 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (Section 382) if it undergoes an “ownership change” as defined in Section 382 (generally where cumulative stock ownership changes among material shareholders exceed 50 percent during a rolling three-year period).  Similar rules may apply under state tax laws.  A future tax “ownership change” pursuant to Section 382 or future changes in tax laws that impose tax attribute utilization limitations may severely limit or effectively eliminate the company’s ability to utilize its NOL carryforwards and other tax attributes. Other factors discussed in this report, although not listed here, also could materially affect the company’s future results.16"
5,UIS,UNISYS CORP,2021-02-26,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSFactors that could affect future results include the following:COVID-19The company’s business and results of operations will be, and our financial condition may be, impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and such impact could be materially adverse.On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains and workforce participation due to “shelter-in-place” restrictions by various governments worldwide and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. The full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operational and financial performance, including our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the pandemic and related restrictions on travel and transportations, the effect on our customers and clients and demand for our products and services; our ability to sell and provide our products and services, including as a result of travel restrictions and people working from home; the ability of our clients to pay for our services and solutions; and any closures of our and our customers’ and clients’ offices and facilities all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted.  Continued impacts of the pandemic could materially adversely impact global economic conditions, our business, results of operations and financial condition, including our cash flow and liquidity, our potential to conduct financings on terms acceptable to us, if at all, and may require significant actions in response, including but not limited to expense reductions or discounting of pricing of our products, in an effort to mitigate such impacts. The full extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will depend largely on future developments, including the duration of the spread of the COVID-19 virus, the availability and effectiveness of a vaccine, the impact on capital and financial markets and the related impact on the financial circumstances of our customers, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. This situation is changing rapidly, and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently.IMPLEMENTATION OF BUSINESS STRATEGY IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY MARKETPLACEIf the company is unable to attract, motivate and retain experienced personnel in key positions, its future results could be adversely impacted.The company’s ability to retain, train and develop its existing associate base in the skills and solutions required to service its target markets with the appropriate solutions is critical to the company’s future success.  The company also needs to attract new talent to augment the skills required to deliver its solutions to its target markets. The failure of the company to attract new talent with the requisite skill set, retain key personnel or implement an appropriate succession plan could adversely impact the company’s ability to successfully carry out its business strategy and retain other key personnel.Future results may be adversely impacted if the company is unable to grow revenue and expand margin in its Digital Workplace Services and Cloud and Infrastructure businesses.The company’s strategy places an emphasis on an industry go-to-market approach with a focus within the company’s Digital Workplace Services and Cloud and Infrastructure businesses on growing revenue, including specifically on higher-value and higher-margin offerings, while growing revenue and increasing margins with its other offerings such as business process outsourcing solutions. The company’s ability to grow revenue and profitability in these businesses will depend on the level of demand for projects and the portfolio of solutions the company offers. It will also depend on an efficient utilization of services delivery personnel. Revenue and profit margins in these businesses are a function of both the portfolio of solutions sold in a given period and the rates the company is able to charge for services and the chargeability of its professionals. If the company is unable to attain sufficient rates and chargeability for its professionals, revenue and profit margins will be adversely affected. The rates the company is able to charge for services are affected by a number of factors, including clients’ perception of the company’s ability to add value through its services; introduction of new services or products by the company or its competitors; pricing policies of competitors; and general economic conditions. Chargeability is also affected by a number of factors, including the company’s ability to transition resources from completed projects to new engagements and across geographies, and its ability to forecast demand for services and thereby maintain appropriate resource levels. The company’s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely impacted if sales of higher-margin offerings do not offset declines in revenue and profitability of lower-margin offerings.Future results may be adversely impacted if the company is unable to maintain its installed base and sell new solutions.The company continues to invest in its ClearPath Forward operating system software in order to retain existing clients in its ClearPath Forward business. If clients do not believe in the value proposition provided by ClearPath Forward or choose not to 11renew their contracts for any other reason, there may not be a meaningful return on these investments, and revenue could decline meaningfully. Furthermore, if ClearPath Forward is sold in the form of Software as a Service (SaaS) at an accelerated pace, this would have a negative impact on the company’s short- and medium-term cash position and could adversely impact the company’s operations, financial condition and liquidity. The company also continues to invest in its Stealth family of software, as well as in other software and solutions. If the company is unsuccessful in selling these Stealth products or other solutions and related services, there may not be a meaningful return on these investments. Further, the revenues generated by Stealth and other new solutions and related services may be insufficient to offset any revenue declines caused if the company is unable to retain its installed base.The company faces aggressive competition in the information services and technology marketplace, which could lead to reduced demand for the company’s services and products and could have an adverse effect on the company’s business.The information services and technology markets in which the company operates include a large number of companies vying for customers and market share both domestically and internationally. The company’s competitors include systems integrators, consulting and other professional services firms, outsourcing providers, infrastructure services providers, computer hardware manufacturers and software providers. Some of the company’s competitors may develop competing services and products that offer better price-performance or that reach the market in advance of the company’s offerings. Some competitors also have or may develop greater financial and other resources than the company, with enhanced ability to compete for market share, in some instances through significant economic incentives to secure contracts. Some also may be better able to compete for skilled professionals. Any of these factors could lead to reduced demand for the company’s services and products and could have an adverse effect on the company’s business. Future results will depend on the company’s ability to mitigate the effects of aggressive competition on revenues, pricing and margins.The company’s future results may be adversely impacted if it is unable to effectively anticipate and respond to volatility and rapid technological innovation in its industry.The company operates in a highly volatile industry characterized by rapid technological innovation, evolving technology standards, short product life cycles and continually changing customer demand patterns. Future success will depend in part on the company’s ability to anticipate and respond to these market trends and to design, develop, introduce, deliver or obtain new and innovative services and products on a timely and cost-effective basis using new delivery models such as cloud computing. Additionally, the company may not be successful in anticipating or responding to changes in technology, industry standards or customer preferences, and the market may not demand or accept its services and product offerings. In addition, services and products developed by competitors may make the company’s offerings less competitive.The company’s future results will depend on its ability to retain significant clients and attract new clients to its solutions.The company has a number of significant long-term contracts with clients, including governmental entities, and its future success will depend, in part, on retaining its relationships with these clients. The company could lose clients for reasons such as contract expiration, conversion to a competing service provider, disputes with clients or a decision to in-source services.  The company could also lose clients as a result of their merger, acquisition or business failure. The company may not be able to replace the revenue and earnings from any such lost client.  The company is expecting revenue, margin and market share expansion due to decisions by some of the company’s competitors to exit or de-emphasize their focus on the company’s target markets. If such competitor’s change that position, it could impact the company’s ability to gain market share. The company’s contracts may not be as profitable as expected or provide the expected level of revenues.In a number of the company’s long-term services contracts, the company’s revenue is based on the volume of services and products provided. As a result, revenue levels anticipated at contract inception are not guaranteed. The company’s contracts with governmental entities are subject to the availability of appropriated funds.  In addition, some of these contracts may permit termination at the customer’s discretion before the end of the contract term or may permit termination or impose other penalties if the company does not meet the performance levels specified in the contracts.Some of the company’s services contracts are fixed-price contracts under which the company assumes the risk for delivery of the contracted services and products at an agreed-upon fixed price. Should the company experience problems in performing fixed-price contracts on a profitable basis, adjustments to the estimated cost to complete may be required. Future results will depend on the company’s ability to perform these services contracts profitably.12The inability of the company to develop or acquire the capabilities to enhance the company’s solutions could adversely impact the company’s revenue and margins and result in the failure to expand the company’s market share.The company’s financial objectives require it to develop, acquire or orchestrate with its strategic partnership network the prerequisite capabilities to enhance the company’s solutions so they contain higher-growth, higher-margin offerings and allow for the expansion of market share.  If the company is unable to do so, its financial performance may be adversely impacted. An increase in the concentration of the company’s business in the global commercial sector of the information technology industry may subject the company’s financial results to increased volatility and greater risk. The company’s operational and financial profile has changed due to the sale of the company’s former U.S. Federal business. As a result, the company’s diversification of historical revenue sources has diminished, and the company’s results of operations, cash flows, working capital and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility and greater risk as a result of the concentration of its business in the global commercial sector of the information technology industry. Moreover, the shares of the company’s common stock will represent an investment in a smaller company than in existence prior to the asset sale and the company’s exposure to the risks inherent in its remaining businesses will increase. Additionally, the company’s ability to return to the U.S. Federal market is restricted by the terms of the non-competition commitments made to Science Applications International Corporation pursuant to the terms of the asset purchase agreement governing the sale.  As a result, the company’s ability to capitalize on market disruptions and the acceleration of our target markets transformation to digital platforms could be impeded.DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANSThe company has significant pension obligations and required cash contributions and may be required to make additional significant cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans.The company has significant unfunded obligations under its U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. In 2020, the company made cash contributions of $826.2 million to its worldwide defined benefit pension plans, which were comprised of $791.1 million for the company’s U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans and $35.1 million primarily for non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Based on current legislation, global regulations, recent interest rates and expected returns, in 2021 the company estimates that it will make cash contributions to its worldwide defined benefit pension plans of approximately $250.6 million, which are comprised of a voluntary contribution of  $200.0 million for the company’s U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans and approximately $50.6 million primarily for non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Estimates for future cash contributions are likely to change based on a number of factors including market conditions and changes in discount rates. If estimates for future contributions change materially, the company may need to obtain additional funding in order to make future contributions. In this event, there is no assurance that the company would be able to obtain such funding or that the company will have enough cash on hand to pay the required cash contributions. Deterioration in the value of the company’s worldwide defined benefit pension plan assets, as well as discount rate changes, asset return changes, or changes in economic or demographic trends, could require the company to make cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in the future in an amount larger than currently anticipated. Increased cash contribution requirements or an acceleration in the due date of such cash contributions would further reduce the cash available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate uses and may worsen the adverse impact on the company’s operations, financial condition and liquidity. TAX ASSETSOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.                                   A corporation’s ability to deduct its federal NOL carryforwards and utilize certain other available tax attributes can be substantially constrained under the general annual limitation rules of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (Section 382) if it undergoes an “ownership change” as defined in Section 382 (generally where cumulative stock ownership changes among material shareholders exceed 50 percent during a rolling three-year period).  Similar rules may apply under state tax laws.  A future tax “ownership change” pursuant to Section 382, may severely limit or effectively eliminate our ability to utilize our NOL carryforwards and other tax attributes. GENERAL BUSINESS RISKSA significant portion of the company’s revenue is derived from operations outside of the United States, and the company is subject to the risks of doing business internationally.A significant amount of the company’s total revenue is derived from international operations. The risks of doing business internationally include foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, changing global data privacy regulations, currency 13restrictions and devaluations, changes in political or economic conditions, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, multiple and possibly overlapping and conflicting tax laws, new tax legislation, weaker intellectual property protections in some jurisdictions and additional legal and regulatory compliance requirements applicable to businesses that operate internationally, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, regulations in the European Union such as the General Data Protection Regulation, the U.K. Bribery Act and other U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations.The company could face business and financial risk in implementing future acquisitions or dispositions.As part of the company’s business strategy, it may from time to time consider acquiring complementary technologies, products and businesses, or disposing of existing technologies, products and businesses, including transactions of a material size. Any acquisitions may result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness or contingent liabilities. Acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and an increase in amortization expenses related to intangible assets. Additional potential risks associated with acquisitions include integration difficulties; difficulties in maintaining or enhancing the profitability of any acquired business; risks of entering markets in which the company has no or limited prior experience; potential loss of employees or failure to maintain or renew any contracts of any acquired business; and expenses of any undiscovered or potential liabilities of the acquired product or business, including relating to employee benefits contribution obligations or environmental requirements. Potential risks with respect to dispositions include difficulty finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner; potential loss of employees or clients; dispositions at unfavorable prices or on unfavorable terms, including relating to retained liabilities; and post-closing indemnity claims. Further, with respect to both acquisitions and dispositions, management’s attention could be diverted from other business concerns. Adverse credit conditions could also affect the company’s ability to consummate acquisitions or dispositions. The risks associated with acquisitions and dispositions could have a material adverse effect upon the company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that the company will be successful in consummating future acquisitions or dispositions on favorable terms or at all. Cybersecurity breaches could result in the company incurring significant costs and could harm the company’s business and reputation.The company’s business includes managing, processing, storing and transmitting proprietary and confidential data, including personal information, intellectual property and proprietary business information, within the company’s own IT systems and those that the company designs, develops, hosts or manages for clients. Cybersecurity breaches involving these systems by hackers, other third parties or the company’s employees, despite established security controls, could disrupt these systems or result in the loss or corruption of data or the unauthorized disclosure or misuse of information of the company, its clients or others. This could result in claims, investigations, litigation and legal liability for the company, lead to the loss of existing or potential clients and adversely affect the market’s perception of the security and reliability of the company’s services and products. In addition, such breaches could subject the company to fines and penalties for violations of laws and result in the company incurring other significant costs. This may negatively impact the company’s reputation and financial results.Future results will depend in part on the performance and capabilities of third parties with whom the company has commercial relationships.The company maintains business relationships with key partners, suppliers, channel partners and other parties that have complementary products, services or skills. Future results will depend, in part, on the performance and capabilities of these third parties, on the ability of external suppliers to deliver components at reasonable prices and in a timely manner, and on the financial condition of, and the company’s relationship with, distributors and other indirect channel partners, which can affect the company’s capacity to effectively and efficiently serve current and potential customers and end users.A failure to meet standards or expectations with respect to the company’s environmental, social and governance practices could adversely impact the company’s business and reputation.Many governmental bodies and current and prospective investors, clients, partners, and employees are increasing their focus on corporate environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices.  If the company fails meet the standards or expectations of any of these groups, the company may suffer reputational damage, the company’s business may be adversely impacted and the company may find it more difficult to recruit or retain key personnel.If the company is unable to access the financing markets, it may adversely impact the company’s business and liquidity. Market conditions may impact the company’s ability to access the financing markets on terms acceptable to the company or at all. If the company is unable to access the financing markets, the company would be required to use cash on hand to fund operations and the company’s required pension contributions and repay outstanding debt as it comes due. There is no assurance that the company will generate sufficient cash to fund its operations and required pension contributions and refinance such debt. A failure by the company to generate such cash would have a material adverse effect on its business if the company were unable to access financing markets and may result in a default with respect to the company’s pension obligation and under the 14company’s debt agreements. Market conditions may also impact the company’s ability to utilize surety bonds, letters of credit, foreign exchange derivatives or other financial instruments the company uses to conduct its business.A reduction in the company’s credit rating could adversely affect its business and/or the holders of its securities.The credit rating agencies rating the company’s indebtedness regularly evaluate the company, and credit ratings are based on a number of factors, including the company’s financial strength and ability to generate earnings, as well as factors not entirely within the company’s control, including conditions affecting the information technology industry and the economy and changes in rating methodologies. There can be no assurance that the company will maintain its current credit ratings. A downgrade of the company’s credit ratings could adversely affect its access to liquidity and capital, and could significantly increase its cost of funds, decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to the company or purchase its securities and impact the company’s ability to utilize surety bonds or other financial instruments the company uses to conduct its business. This could affect the company’s growth, profitability, and financial condition, including liquidity.The company’s business may be adversely affected by global economic conditions, acts of war, terrorism, natural disasters or the widespread outbreak of infectious diseases.If global economic conditions deteriorate, the company could see reductions in demand and increased pressure on revenue and profit margins. The company could also see a further consolidation of clients, which could also result in a decrease in demand. The company’s business could also be affected by acts of war, terrorism, natural disasters and the widespread outbreak of infectious diseases. Current world tensions could escalate, and this could have unpredictable consequences on the world economy and on the company’s business.  If, as a result of such an event, the company’s clients in a particular industry were to suffer material adverse impacts, the company may experience a reduction in demand for its services and products from such clients, which may materially and adversely affect the company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.The impact of Brexit could adversely affect the company’s operations in the United Kingdom as well as the funded status of the company’s U.K. pension plans.The impact of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union, commonly referred to as “Brexit”, and the resulting effect on the political and economic future of the U.K. and the European Union is uncertain. Depending on the outcome, the company may decide to alter its European operations to respond to the new business, legal, regulatory, tax and trade environments that may result, which may adversely affect the company’s financial results. In addition, uncertainty regarding Brexit could cause a slowdown in economic activity in the U.K., the European Union or globally. As a result of these possible effects, among others, Brexit could adversely impact the company’s operations in the U.K., cause increased volatility in the measurement of the pension assets or benefit obligations in the company’s U.K. pension plans, as well as adversely affect the funded status of the company’s U.K. pension plans.A significant disruption in the company’s IT systems could adversely affect the company’s business and reputation.We rely extensively on our IT systems to conduct our business and perform services for our clients. Our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, computer viruses and malicious attacks, cybersecurity breaches and catastrophic events. If our systems are accessed without our authorization, damaged or fail to function properly, we could incur substantial repair or replacement costs, experience data loss and impediments to our ability to conduct our business, and damage the market’s perception of our services and products. In addition, a disruption could result in the company failing to meet performance standards and obligations in its client contracts, which could subject the company to liability, penalties and contract termination. This may adversely affect the company’s reputation and financial results.The company may face damage to its reputation or legal liability if its clients are not satisfied with its services or products.The success of the company’s business is dependent on strong, long-term client relationships and on its reputation for responsiveness and quality. As a result, if a client is not satisfied with the company’s services or products, its reputation could be damaged and its business adversely affected. Allegations by private litigants or regulators of improper conduct, as well as negative publicity and press speculation about the company, whatever the outcome and whether or not valid, may harm its reputation. In addition to harm to reputation, if the company fails to meet its contractual obligations, it could be subject to legal liability, which could adversely affect its business, operating results and financial condition.The company’s services or products may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others.The company cannot be sure that its services and products do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, and it may have infringement claims asserted against it or against its clients. These claims could cost the company money, prevent it from offering some services or products, or damage its reputation.15Legal proceedings could affect the company’s results of operations or cash flow or may adversely affect the company’s business or reputation.Various lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings that have been brought or asserted against the company in the past relating to matters arising in the ordinary course of business, including actions with respect to commercial and government contracts, labor and employment, employee benefits, environmental matters, intellectual property and non-income tax matters. The company believes that it has valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against it. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, however, and it is possible that the company’s results of operations or cash flows could be materially affected in any particular period as a result of future developments of the legal matters pending against it, including the resolution of any such matters. Additional legal proceedings may arise in the future with respect to the company’s existing and legacy operations that may adversely affect the company’s business or reputation.Other factors discussed in this report, although not listed here, also could materially affect our future results"
0,UIS,UNISYS CORP,2020-02-28,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSFactors that could affect future results include the following:Risks Related to the Company’s BusinessFuture results may be adversely impacted if the company is unable to continue revenue growth and margin expansion in its Services business. The company’s strategy places an emphasis on an industry go-to-market approach with a focus within the company’s Services business on growing revenue, including specifically on higher value and higher margin offerings. The company’s ability to grow revenue and profitability in this business will depend on the level of demand for projects and the portfolio of solutions the company offers. It will also depend on an efficient utilization of services delivery personnel. Revenue and profit margins in this business are a function of both the portfolio of solutions sold in a given period and the rates the company is able to charge for services and the chargeability of its professionals. If the company is unable to attain sufficient rates and chargeability for its professionals, revenue and profit margins will be adversely affected. The rates the company is able to charge for services are affected by a number of factors, including clients’ perception of the company’s ability to add value through its services; introduction of new services or products by the company or its competitors; pricing policies of competitors; and general economic conditions. Chargeability is also affected by a number of factors, including the company’s ability to transition resources from completed projects to new engagements and across geographies, and its ability to forecast demand for services and thereby maintain appropriate resource levels. The company’s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely impacted if sales of higher margin offerings do not offset declines in revenue and profitability resulting from lower margin offerings.The company has significant pension obligations and required cash contributions and may be required to make additional significant cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans. The company has significant unfunded obligations under its U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. In 2019, the company made cash contributions of $103.9 million to its worldwide defined benefit pension plans. Based on current legislation, global regulations, recent interest rates and expected returns, in 2020 the company estimates that it will be required to make cash contributions to its worldwide defined benefit pension plans of approximately $278.9 million, which are comprised of approximately $238.8 million for the company’s U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans and approximately $40.1 million primarily for non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Although estimates for future cash contributions are likely to change based on a number of factors including market conditions and changes in discount rates, the company currently anticipates that its required cash contributions will remain significant for the next several years. Based on conditions as of December 31, 2019, the company anticipates that its required cash contributions for 2020 through 2024 will be approximately $1.2 billion in the aggregate. The company currently anticipates that it may need to obtain additional funding in order to make these contributions. There is no assurance that the company will be able to obtain such funding or that the company will have enough cash on hand to pay the required cash contributions. If the proposed sale of the company’s U.S. Federal business is consummated, the company plans to use approximately $600 million of the net proceeds from the sale to fund the required cash contributions for 2020 through 2022.  However, there is no assurance that the sale will be completed.  See “--Risks Related to the Announced Sale of the Company’s U.S. Federal Business.”The company has also applied for waivers with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to defer a portion of the required contributions to its two U.S. qualified defined benefit pensions plan, which if granted would reduce total required cash contributions by approximately $115 milllion in calendar year 2020 and defer these payments over a five-year period.  There is no specified time frame in which the IRS must make a decision.  The IRS may choose not to grant the application, or to grant it for an amount less than the amount requested.Deterioration in the value of the company’s worldwide defined benefit pension plan assets, as well as discount rate changes, asset return changes, or changes in economic or demographic trends, could require the company to make cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in the future in an amount larger than currently anticipated. Increased cash contribution requirements or an acceleration in the due date of such cash contributions would further reduce the cash available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate uses and may worsen the adverse impact on the company’s operations, financial condition and liquidity.If the company is unable to access the financing markets, it may adversely impact the company’s business and liquidity and may result in a default with respect to the company’s pension obligations and under the company’s debt agreements. Market conditions may impact the company’s ability to access the financing markets on terms acceptable to the company or at all. Based on the most recent estimates for the required cash contributions to the company’s worldwide defined benefit pension plans for the period from 2020 to 2024, the company anticipates that it will need to obtain additional financing in order to fund some or all of these contributions. If the company is unable to access the financing markets, the company would be required to use cash on hand to fund operations and the company’s required pension contributions and repay outstanding debt as it comes 11due. There is no assurance that the company will generate sufficient cash to fund its operations and required pension contributions and refinance such debt. A failure by the company to generate such cash would have a material adverse effect on its business if the company were unable to access financing markets and may result in a default with respect to the company’s pension obligation and under the company’s debt agreements. Market conditions may also impact the company’s ability to utilize surety bonds, letters of credit, foreign exchange derivatives or other financial instruments the company uses to conduct its business.If the proposed sale of the company’s U.S. Federal business is consummated, the company plans to use a portion of the net proceeds from the sale to redeem its $440 million senior secured notes due 2022. See “--Risks Related to the Announced Sale of the Company’s U.S. Federal Business.” In the event that the Company seeks to raise additional funds in the future by accessing the financing markets, there can be no assurances that such future financings would be on similar or favorable terms as compared to the senior secured notes due 2022 or that the company would be able to access the financing markets at all. A reduction in the company’s credit rating could adversely affect its business and/or the holders of its securities.The credit rating agencies rating the company’s indebtedness regularly evaluate the company, and credit ratings are based on a number of factors, including the company’s financial strength and ability to generate earnings, as well as factors not entirely within the company’s control, including conditions affecting the information technology industry and the economy and changes in rating methodologies. There can be no assurance that the company will maintain its current credit ratings. A downgrade of the company’s credit ratings could adversely affect its access to liquidity and capital, and could significantly increase its cost of funds, decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to the company or purchase its securities and impact the company’s ability to utilize surety bonds or other financial instruments the company uses to conduct its business. This could affect the company’s growth, profitability, and financial condition, including liquidity.Future results may be adversely impacted if the company is unable to maintain its installed base and sell new solutions. The company continues to invest in its ClearPath Forward operating system software in order to retain existing clients in its Technology business. If clients do not believe in the value proposition provided by ClearPath Forward or choose not to renew their contracts for any other reason, there may not be a meaningful return on these investments, and revenue could decline meaningfully. Furthermore, if ClearPath Forward is sold as a Software as a Service (SaaS) at an accelerated pace, this would have a negative impact on the company’s short- and medium-term cash position and could adversely impact the company’s operations, financial condition and liquidity. The company also continues to invest in its Stealth family of software, as well as in other software and solutions. If the company is unsuccessful in selling these Stealth products or other solutions and related services, there may not be a meaningful return on these investments. Further, the revenues generated by Stealth and other new solutions and related services may be insufficient to offset any revenue declines caused if the company is unable to retain its installed base.The company faces aggressive competition in the information services and technology marketplace, which could lead to reduced demand for the company’s services and products and could have an adverse effect on the company’s business. The information services and technology markets in which the company operates include a large number of companies vying for customers and market share both domestically and internationally. The company’s competitors include systems integrators, consulting and other professional services firms, outsourcing providers, infrastructure services providers, computer hardware manufacturers and software providers. Some of the company’s competitors may develop competing services and products that offer better price-performance or that reach the market in advance of the company’s offerings. Some competitors also have or may develop greater financial and other resources than the company, with enhanced ability to compete for market share, in some instances through significant economic incentives to secure contracts. Some also may be better able to compete for skilled professionals. Any of these factors could lead to reduced demand for the company’s services and products and could have an adverse effect on the company’s business. Future results will depend on the company’s ability to mitigate the effects of aggressive competition on revenues, pricing and margins and on the company’s ability to attract and retain talented people.Cybersecurity breaches could result in the company incurring significant costs and could harm the company’s business and reputation. The company’s business includes managing, processing, storing and transmitting proprietary and confidential data, including personal information, intellectual property and proprietary business information, within the company’s own IT systems and those that the company designs, develops, hosts or manages for clients. Cybersecurity breaches involving these systems by hackers, other third parties or the company’s employees, despite established security controls, could disrupt these systems or result in the loss or corruption of data or the unauthorized disclosure or misuse of information of the company, its clients or others. This could result in claims, investigations, litigation and legal liability for the company, lead to the loss of existing or potential clients and adversely affect the market’s perception of the security and reliability of the company’s services and products. In addition, such breaches could subject the company to fines and penalties for violations of laws and result in the company incurring other significant costs. This may negatively impact the company’s reputation and financial results.12The company’s future results may be adversely impacted if it is unable to effectively anticipate and respond to volatility and rapid technological innovation in its industry. The company operates in a highly volatile industry characterized by rapid technological innovation, evolving technology standards, short product life cycles and continually changing customer demand patterns. Future success will depend in part on the company’s ability to anticipate and respond to these market trends and to design, develop, introduce, deliver or obtain new and innovative services and products on a timely and cost-effective basis using new delivery models such as cloud computing. The company may not be successful in anticipating or responding to changes in technology, industry standards or customer preferences, and the market may not demand or accept its services and product offerings. In addition, services and products developed by competitors may make the company’s offerings less competitive.The company’s future results will depend on its ability to retain significant clients. The company has a number of significant long-term contracts with clients, including governmental entities, and its future success will depend, in part, on retaining its relationships with these clients. The company could lose clients for reasons such as contract expiration, conversion to a competing service provider, disputes with clients or a decision to in-source services, including contracts with governmental entities as part of the rebid process. The company could also lose clients as a result of their merger, acquisition or business failure. The company may not be able to replace the revenue and earnings from any such lost client.The company’s contracts may not be as profitable as expected or provide the expected level of revenues. In a number of the company’s long-term services contracts, the company’s revenue is based on the volume of services and products provided. As a result, revenue levels anticipated at the contract’s inception are not guaranteed. In addition, some of these contracts may permit termination at the customer’s discretion before the end of the contract’s term or may permit termination or impose other penalties if the company does not meet the performance levels specified in the contracts.The company’s contracts with governmental entities are subject to the availability of appropriated funds. These contracts also contain provisions allowing the governmental entity to terminate the contract at the governmental entity’s discretion before the end of the contract’s term. In addition, if the company’s performance is unacceptable to the customer under a government contract, the government retains the right to pursue remedies under the affected contract, which remedies could include termination.Certain of the company’s services agreements require that the company’s prices be benchmarked if the customer requests it and provide that those prices may be adjusted downward if the pricing for similar services in the market has changed. As a result, revenues anticipated at the beginning of the terms of these contracts may decline in the future.Some of the company’s services contracts are fixed-price contracts under which the company assumes the risk for delivery of the contracted services and products at an agreed-upon fixed price. Should the company experience problems in performing fixed-price contracts on a profitable basis, adjustments to the estimated cost to complete may be required. Future results will depend on the company’s ability to perform these services contracts profitably.A significant portion of the company’s revenue is derived from operations outside of the United States, and the company is subject to the risks of doing business internationally. Approximately 47% of the company’s total revenue is derived from international operations, and if the proposed sale of the U.S. Federal business is consummated, the portion of the company’s total revenue derived from international operations will be approximately 63%. The risks of doing business internationally include foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, currency restrictions and devaluations, changes in political or economic conditions, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, multiple and possibly overlapping and conflicting tax laws, new tax legislation, weaker intellectual property protections in some jurisdictions and additional legal and regulatory compliance requirements applicable to businesses that operate internationally, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, regulations in the European Union such as the General Data Protection Regulation, the U.K. Bribery Act and other U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations.The company could face business and financial risk in implementing future acquisitions or dispositions. As part of the company’s business strategy, it may from time to time consider acquiring complementary technologies, products and businesses, or disposing of existing technologies, products and businesses, including transactions of a material size and including the proposed sale of the U.S. Federal business. Any acquisitions may result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness or contingent liabilities. Acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and an increase in amortization expenses related to intangible assets. Additional potential risks associated with acquisitions include integration difficulties; difficulties in maintaining or enhancing the profitability of any acquired business; risks of entering markets in which the company has no or limited prior experience; potential loss of employees or failure to maintain or renew any contracts of any acquired business; and expenses of any undiscovered or potential liabilities of the acquired product or business, including relating to employee benefits contribution obligations or environmental requirements. Potential risks with respect to dispositions, such as the proposed sale of the U.S. Federal business, include difficulty finding buyers or alternative 13exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner; potential loss of employees or clients; dispositions at unfavorable prices or on unfavorable terms, including relating to retained liabilities; and post-closing indemnity claims. Further, with respect to both acquisitions and dispositions, management’s attention could be diverted from other business concerns. Adverse credit conditions could also affect the company’s ability to consummate acquisitions or dispositions. The risks associated with acquisitions and dispositions could have a material adverse effect upon the company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that the company will be successful in consummating future acquisitions or dispositions on favorable terms or at all. For a discussion of certain risks relating to the proposed sale of the company’s U.S. Federal business, see “--Risks Related to the Announced Sale of the Company’s U.S. Federal Business.”The company’s business may be adversely affected by global economic conditions, acts of war, terrorism, natural disasters or the widespread outbreak of infectious diseases.If global economic conditions deteriorate, the company could see reductions in demand and increased pressure on revenue and profit margins. The company could also see a further consolidation of clients, which could also result in a decrease in demand. The company’s business could also be affected by acts of war, terrorism, natural disasters and the widespread outbreak of infectious diseases. Current world tensions could escalate, and this could have unpredictable consequences on the world economy and on the company’s business.  If, as a result of such an event, such as the outbreak of the coronavirus known as Covid-19, the company’s clients in a particular industry such as travel and transportation companies or financial institutions were to suffer material adverse impacts, the company may experience a reduction in demand for its services and products from such clients, which may materially and adversely affect the company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.  The impact of Brexit could adversely affect the company’s operations in the United Kingdom as well as the funded status of the company’s U.K. pension plans.The impact of the decision by the United Kingdom to withdraw from the European Union, commonly referred to as “Brexit”, and the resulting effect on the political and economic future of the U.K. and the European Union is uncertain. Depending on the outcome, the company may decide to alter its European operations to respond to the new business, legal, regulatory, tax and trade environments that may result, which may adversely affect the company’s financial results. In addition, uncertainty regarding Brexit could cause a slowdown in economic activity in the U.K., the European Union or globally. As a result of these possible effects, among others, Brexit could adversely impact the company’s operations in the U.K., cause increased volatility in the measurement of the pension assets or benefit obligations in the company’s U.K. pension plans, as well as adversely affect the funded status of the company’s U.K. pension plans.If the company is unable to attract, motivate and retain experienced and knowledgeable personnel in key positions, its future results could be adversely impacted. The success of the company’s business is dependent upon its ability to employ and train individuals with the requisite knowledge, skills and experience to execute the company’s business model and achieve its business objectives. The failure of the company to retain key personnel or implement an appropriate succession plan could adversely impact the company’s ability to successfully carry out its business strategy and retain other key personnel. A significant disruption in the company’s IT systems could adversely affect the company’s business and reputation. We rely extensively on our IT systems to conduct our business and perform services for our clients. Our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, computer viruses and malicious attacks, cybersecurity breaches and catastrophic events. If our systems are accessed without our authorization, damaged or fail to function properly, we could incur substantial repair or replacement costs, experience data loss and impediments to our ability to conduct our business, and damage the market’s perception of our services and products. In addition, a disruption could result in the company failing to meet performance standards and obligations in its client contracts, which could subject the company to liability, penalties and contract termination. This may adversely affect the company’s reputation and financial results. A U.S. Federal government shutdown may adversely affect the company’s results of operations and cash flows.Currently, approximately 25% of the company’s total consolidated revenue is derived from sales of commercial services and products to various agencies of the U.S. Federal government. The impact of a U.S. Federal government shutdown for a significant duration could result in the suspension of work on contracts in process or in payment delays which could have an adverse effect on the company’s revenue, profit and cash flows. If the proposed sale of the company’s U.S. Federal business is consummated, the company will no longer derive any revenue from direct sales of commercial services and products to the U.S. Federal government, though it is expected that the buyer of the U.S. Federal business will be a reseller of certain of the company’s services and products to various agencies of the U.S. Federal government. However, there is no assurance that the sale will be completed. See “--Risks Related to the Announced Sale of the Company’s U.S. Federal Business.”The company’s contracts with U.S. governmental agencies may subject the company to audits, criminal penalties, sanctions and other expenses and fines. 14The company frequently enters into contracts with governmental entities. U.S. government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency and the Department of Labor, routinely audit government contractors. These agencies review a contractor’s performance under its contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. The U.S. government also may review the adequacy of, and a contractor’s compliance with, contract terms and conditions, and its systems and policies, including the contractor’s purchasing, property, estimating, billing, accounting, compensation and management information systems. Any costs found to be overcharged or improperly allocated to a specific contract or any amounts improperly billed or charged for products or services will be subject to reimbursement to the government. In addition, government contractors, such as the company, are required to disclose credible evidence of certain violations of law and contract overcharging to the federal government. If the company is found to have participated in improper or illegal activities, the company may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. government. Any negative publicity related to such contracts, regardless of the accuracy of such publicity, may adversely affect the company’s business or reputation. If the proposed sale of the company’s U.S. Federal business is consummated, it is expected that all of the company’s contracts with U.S. Federal governmental entities will be assigned to the buyer of that business after the sale. However, there is no assurance that the sale will be completed. See “--Risks Related to the Announced Sale of the Company’s U.S. Federal Business.”The company may face damage to its reputation or legal liability if its clients are not satisfied with its services or products. The success of the company’s business is dependent on strong, long-term client relationships and on its reputation for responsiveness and quality. As a result, if a client is not satisfied with the company’s services or products, its reputation could be damaged and its business adversely affected. Allegations by private litigants or regulators of improper conduct, as well as negative publicity and press speculation about the company, whatever the outcome and whether or not valid, may harm its reputation. In addition to harm to reputation, if the company fails to meet its contractual obligations, it could be subject to legal liability, which could adversely affect its business, operating results and financial condition.Future results will depend in part on the performance and capabilities of third parties with whom the company has commercial relationships. The company maintains business relationships with suppliers, channel partners and other parties that have complementary products, services or skills. Future results will depend, in part, on the performance and capabilities of these third parties, on the ability of external suppliers to deliver components at reasonable prices and in a timely manner, and on the financial condition of, and the company’s relationship with, distributors and other indirect channel partners, which can affect the company’s capacity to effectively and efficiently serve current and potential customers and end users.An involuntary termination of the company’s U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans would adversely affect the company’s financial condition and results of operations.As of December 31, 2019, the company had approximately $1.3 billion of underfunded pension obligations under its U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the PBGC) has authority under the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, to terminate an underfunded defined benefit pension plan under certain circumstances, including when (1) the plan has not met the minimum funding requirements, (2) the plan cannot pay current benefits when due, or (3) the loss to the PBGC is reasonably expected to increase unreasonably over time if the plan is not terminated. If the PBGC were to terminate the company’s U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans, the company’s obligations with respect to such plans would become due and payable in full. Any such event or the failure by the company to pay its pension plan insurance premiums with respect to its U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans could result in the PBGC obtaining a lien on the company’s assets. Such an event would result in an event of default under the company’s debt agreements and would materially and adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.The company’s services or products may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. The company cannot be sure that its services and products do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, and it may have infringement claims asserted against it or against its clients. These claims could cost the company money, prevent it from offering some services or products, or damage its reputation.Legal proceedings could affect the company’s results of operations or cash flow or may adversely affect the company’s business or reputation. There are various lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings that have been brought or asserted against the company, which arise in the ordinary course of business, including actions with respect to commercial and government contracts, labor and employment, employee benefits, environmental matters, intellectual property and non-income tax matters. See Note 17, “Litigation and contingencies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) (the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) for more information on litigation. The company believes that it has valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against it. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, however, and it is possible that the company’s results of operations or cash flows could be materially affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of the 15legal matters pending against it. Additional legal proceedings may arise in the future with respect to the company’s existing and legacy operations, and may adversely affect the company’s business or reputation.Other factors discussed in this report, although not listed here, also could materially affect our future results.Risks Related to the Announced Sale of the Company’s U.S. Federal BusinessThe company’s business and financial results could be adversely impacted during the pendency of the sale of the U.S. Federal business, particularly if there is a delay in the completion of the sale.On February 5, 2020, the company entered into an asset purchase agreement to sell its U.S. Federal business, which provides certain products and services to federal government customers, to Science Applications International Corporation. The pending sale of the U.S. Federal business may cause disruptions to the company’s business or business relationships, and may create uncertainty surrounding the company’s ongoing business operations, which could materially and adversely affect the company’s business, results of operations or financial condition, regardless of whether the sale of the U.S. Federal business is completed, including as a result of the attention of company’s management being directed to transaction-related considerations and being diverted from the day-to-day operations of the company’s business, the uncertainty regarding the company’s future which may adversely affect the company’s ability to hire, retain and motivate key personnel and other employees, and customers, suppliers or other parties with whom the company maintains business relationships experiencing uncertainty prior to the closing of the sale of the U.S. Federal business and seeking alternative relationships with third parties or seeking to terminate or renegotiated their relationships with the company.In addition, with respect to the sale of the U.S. Federal business, the asset purchase agreement restricts the company from engaging in certain actions with respect to the U.S. Federal business without the consent of Science Applications International Corporation, which could prevent the company from pursuing business opportunities related to the U.S. Federal business that may arise prior to the consummation of the sale of the U.S. Federal business. Furthermore, the asset purchase agreement includes an indemnity by the company in favor of Science Applications International Corporation against losses incurred arising out of breaches of representations, warranties and covenants made by the company and liabilities expressly retained by the company.The company has incurred, and will continue to incur, transaction costs in connection with the pending sale of the U.S. Federal business, and many of these fees and costs are payable regardless of whether or not the sale of the U.S. Federal business is completed.If the proposed sale of the U.S. Federal business is completed, the company may not achieve the operational and financial results that it anticipates in the future.If the proposed sale of the U.S. Federal business is completed, the company’s operational and financial profile will change upon the separation of the U.S. Federal business from the company’s other businesses. As a result, the company’s diversification of revenue sources will diminish, and the company’s results of operations, cash flows, working capital and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility and greater risk as a result of the concentration of its business in the global commercial sector of the information technology industry. Moreover, the shares of the company’s common stock will represent an investment in a smaller company than in existence today and the company’s exposure to the risks inherent in its remaining businesses will increase.  Additionally, the company’s ability to return to the U.S. Federal business is restricted by the terms of the non-competition commitments made to Science Applications International Corporation pursuant to the terms of the asset purchase agreement governing the sale. While the company’s cash flows will decrease after the proposed sale is consummated, the company will still have a substantial amount of outstanding pension obligations, even after the company applies a portion of the proceeds of the sale to reduce U.S. pension obligations. There is no certainty that the company will have the cash on hand to make the required cash contributions to the company’s worldwide defined benefit pension plans in the future without additional funding. Following the closing of the pending sale of the U.S. Federal business, the company plans to use the net proceeds from the sale to pay down debt and reduce U.S. pension obligations, which may not improve the company’s results of operations or cash flows. Further, the anticipated benefits to the company of the proposed sale are based on a number of assumptions, some of which may prove incorrect. Any such incorrect assumptions could adversely affect the company’s business, results of operations or financial condition.An “ownership change” could limit the company’s ability to utilize net operating  losses and certain other tax attributes to offset the gain from the pending sale of the U.S. Federal business. The company has significant net operating losses and certain other tax attributes (collectively, NOLs) for federal income tax purposes that it expects to use to offset the gain from the sale of the U.S. Federal business. The company’s ability to use its NOLs to offset the gain from the sale of the U.S. Federal business may be significantly limited if the company experiences an 16“ownership change” as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). In general, an ownership change will occur when the percentage of the company’s ownership (by value) by one or more “5-percent shareholders” (as defined in the Code) has increased by more than 50 percent over the lowest percentage owned by such shareholders at any time during the prior three years (calculated on a rolling basis). An entity that experiences an ownership change generally will be subject to an annual limitation on the use of its pre-ownership change tax loss and credit carryforwards equal to the equity value of the corporation immediately before the ownership change, multiplied by the long-term, tax-exempt rate posted monthly by the IRS (subject to certain adjustments). The limitation on the company’s ability to utilize its NOLs arising from an ownership change under Section 382 would depend on the value of the company’s equity at the time of any ownership change. If the company were to experience an “ownership change”, it is possible that the company would not be able to offset the taxable gain from the proposed sale, which is estimated to be approximately $1 billion.On February 5, 2020, the company adopted a Tax Asset Protection Plan to help protect the use of its NOLs. This plan is designed to reduce the likelihood of an “ownership change” by (i) discouraging any person or group from becoming a 4.9 percent shareholder and (ii) discouraging any existing 4.9 percent shareholder from acquiring additional shares of company stock. Despite the intentions of the plan to deter and prevent an “ownership change”, such an event may still occur. In addition, the plan may make it more difficult and more expensive to acquire the company, and may discourage open market purchases of company stock or a non-negotiated tender or exchange offer for company stock. Accordingly, the plan may limit a shareholder’s ability to realize a premium over the market price of company stock in connection with any stock transaction.The price of the company’s stock may be volatile during the pendency of the sale of the U.S. Federal business, and stockholders could lose all or part of their investment. The trading price of the company’s common stock may at times be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond the company’s control. In addition to other factors, these factors may include the timing and process for completion of the sale, including potential delays which may cause significant fluctuations in the price of the company’s stock.The occurrence of any event, change or other circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the asset purchase agreement for the sale of the U.S. Federal business could adversely affect the company’s future business.There are significant risks and uncertainties associated with the pending sale of the company's U.S. Federal business. The occurrence of certain events, changes or any other circumstances could give rise to the termination of the asset purchase agreement governing the sale and cause the sale not to be completed. For instance, there is no assurance that the parties to the agreement will receive the necessary regulatory approvals required to close the transaction. If the parties fail to obtain such approvals or to meet other conditions necessary to complete the sale as set forth in the asset purchase agreement, the company may not be able to close the transaction and the company may not realize the anticipated benefits to its business and financial condition.17"
3,UIS,UNISYS CORP,2019-03-04,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSFactors that could affect future results include the following:Future results may be adversely impacted if the company is unable to improve revenue and margins in its Services business. The company’s strategy places an emphasis on an industry go-to-market approach with an increased focus within the company’s Services business on improving revenue trends, including specifically on higher value and higher margin offerings. The company’s ability to grow revenue and profitability in this business will depend on the level of demand for projects and the portfolio of solutions the company offers for specific industries. It will also depend on an efficient utilization of services delivery personnel. Revenue and profit margins in this business are a function of both the portfolio of solutions sold in a given period and the rates the company is able to charge for services and the chargeability of its professionals. If the company is unable to attain sufficient rates and chargeability for its professionals, revenue and profit margins will be adversely affected. The rates the company is able to charge for services are affected by a number of factors, including clients’ perception of the company’s ability to add value through its services; introduction of new services or products by the company or its competitors; pricing policies of competitors; and general economic conditions. Chargeability is also affected by a number of factors, including the company’s ability to transition resources from completed projects to new engagements and across geographies, and its ability to forecast demand for services and thereby maintain appropriate resource levels. The company’s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely impacted if sales of higher margin offerings do not offset declines resulting from lower margin offerings.Future results may be adversely impacted if the company is unable to maintain its installed base and sell new solutions in its Technology business. The company continues to invest in its ClearPath Forward operating system software in order to retain existing clients in its Technology business. If clients do not believe in the value proposition provided by ClearPath Forward or choose not to renew their contracts for any other reason, there may not be a meaningful return on these investments, and revenue could decline meaningfully. The company also continues to invest in its Stealth family of software, as well as in industry-specific software and solutions for its focus industries. If the company is unsuccessful in selling these Stealth products or industry-specific solutions and related services, there may not be a meaningful return on these investments. Further, the revenues generated by Stealth and other new solutions and related services may be insufficient to offset any revenue declines caused if the company is unable to retain its installed base.The company faces aggressive competition in the information services and technology marketplace, which could lead to reduced demand for the company’s services and products and could have an adverse effect on the company’s business. The information services and technology markets in which the company operates include a large number of companies vying for customers and market share both domestically and internationally. The company’s competitors include systems integrators, consulting and other professional services firms, outsourcing providers, infrastructure services providers, computer hardware manufacturers and software providers. Some of the company’s competitors may develop competing services and products that offer better price-performance or that reach the market in advance of the company’s offerings. Some competitors also have or may develop greater financial and other resources than the company, with enhanced ability to compete for market share, in some instances through significant economic incentives to secure contracts. Some also may be better able to compete for skilled professionals. Any of these factors could lead to reduced demand for the company’s services and products and could have an adverse effect on the company’s business. Future results will depend on the company’s ability to mitigate the effects of aggressive competition on revenues, pricing and margins and on the company’s ability to attract and retain talented people.The company has significant pension obligations and required cash contributions and may be required to make additional significant cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans. The company has significant unfunded obligations under its U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. In 2018, the company made cash contributions of $129.7 million to its worldwide defined benefit pension plans. Based on current legislation, global regulations, recent interest rates and expected returns, in 2019 the company estimates that it will make cash contributions to its worldwide defined benefit pension plans of approximately $105.6 million, which are comprised of approximately $67.2 million for the company’s U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans and approximately $38.4 million primarily for non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Although estimates for future cash contributions are likely to change based on a number of factors including market conditions and changes in discount rates, the company currently anticipates that its required cash contributions will increase in 2020 and for the next several years.Deterioration in the value of the company’s worldwide defined benefit pension plan assets, as well as discount rate changes or changes in economic or demographic trends, could require the company to make cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in the future in an amount larger than currently anticipated. Increased cash contribution requirements or an acceleration in the due date of such cash contributions would reduce the cash available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate uses and may have an adverse impact on the company’s operations, financial condition and liquidity.10Cybersecurity breaches could result in the company incurring significant costs and could harm the company’s business and reputation. The company’s business includes managing, processing, storing and transmitting proprietary and confidential data, including personal information, intellectual property and proprietary business information, within the company’s own IT systems and those that the company designs, develops, hosts or manages for clients. Cybersecurity breaches involving these systems by hackers, other third parties or the company’s employees, despite established security controls, could disrupt these systems or result in the loss or corruption of data or the unauthorized disclosure or misuse of information of the company, its clients or others. This could result in claims, investigations, litigation and legal liability for the company, lead to the loss of existing or potential clients and adversely affect the market’s perception of the security and reliability of the company’s services and products. In addition, such breaches could subject the company to fines and penalties for violations of laws and result in the company incurring other significant costs. This may negatively impact the company’s reputation and financial results.A U.S. Federal government shutdown may adversely affect the company’s results of operations and cash flows.Approximately 20% of the company’s total consolidated revenue is derived from sales of commercial services and products to various agencies of the U.S. Federal government. The impact of a U.S. Federal government shutdown for a significant duration could result in the suspension of work on contracts in process or in payment delays which could have an adverse effect on the company’s revenue, profit and cash flows. The company’s future results may be adversely impacted if it is unable to effectively anticipate and respond to volatility and rapid technological innovation in its industry. The company operates in a highly volatile industry characterized by rapid technological innovation, evolving technology standards, short product life cycles and continually changing customer demand patterns. Future success will depend in part on the company’s ability to anticipate and respond to these market trends and to design, develop, introduce, deliver or obtain new and innovative services and products on a timely and cost-effective basis using new delivery models such as cloud computing. The company may not be successful in anticipating or responding to changes in technology, industry standards or customer preferences, and the market may not demand or accept its services and product offerings. In addition, services and products developed by competitors may make the company’s offerings less competitive.The company’s future results will depend on its ability to retain significant clients. The company has a number of significant long-term contracts with clients, including governmental entities, and its future success will depend, in part, on retaining its relationships with these clients. The company could lose clients for reasons such as contract expiration, conversion to a competing service provider, disputes with clients or a decision to in-source services, including contracts with governmental entities as part of the rebid process. The company could also lose clients as a result of their merger, acquisition or business failure. The company may not be able to replace the revenue and earnings from any such lost client.The company’s contracts may not be as profitable as expected or provide the expected level of revenues. In a number of the company’s long-term services contracts, the company’s revenue is based on the volume of services and products provided. As a result, revenue levels anticipated at the contract’s inception are not guaranteed. In addition, some of these contracts may permit termination at the customer’s discretion before the end of the contract’s term or may permit termination or impose other penalties if the company does not meet the performance levels specified in the contracts.The company’s contracts with governmental entities are subject to the availability of appropriated funds. These contracts also contain provisions allowing the governmental entity to terminate the contract at the governmental entity’s discretion before the end of the contract’s term. In addition, if the company’s performance is unacceptable to the customer under a government contract, the government retains the right to pursue remedies under the affected contract, which remedies could include termination.Certain of the company’s services agreements require that the company’s prices be benchmarked if the customer requests it and provide that those prices may be adjusted downward if the pricing for similar services in the market has changed. As a result, revenues anticipated at the beginning of the terms of these contracts may decline in the future.Some of the company’s services contracts are fixed-price contracts under which the company assumes the risk for delivery of the contracted services and products at an agreed-upon fixed price. Should the company experience problems in performing fixed-price contracts on a profitable basis, adjustments to the estimated cost to complete may be required. Future results will depend on the company’s ability to perform these services contracts profitably.A significant portion of the company’s revenue is derived from operations outside of the United States, and the company is subject to the risks of doing business internationally. A significant portion of the company’s total revenue is derived from international operations. The risks of doing business internationally include foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, currency restrictions and devaluations, changes in political or economic conditions, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, multiple and possibly overlapping 11and conflicting tax laws, new tax legislation, weaker intellectual property protections in some jurisdictions and additional legal and regulatory compliance requirements applicable to businesses that operate internationally, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, regulations in the European Union such as the General Data Protection Regulation, the U.K. Bribery Act and other U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations.If the company is unable to access the financing markets, it may adversely impact the company’s business and liquidity. Market conditions may impact the company’s ability to access the financing markets on terms acceptable to the company or at all. If the company is unable to access the financing markets, the company would be required to use cash on hand to fund operations and repay outstanding debt as it comes due. There is no assurance that the company will generate sufficient cash to fund its operations and refinance such debt. A failure by the company to generate such cash would have a material adverse effect on its business if the company were unable to access financing markets. Market conditions may also impact the company’s ability to utilize surety bonds, letters of credit, foreign exchange derivatives or other financial instruments the company uses to conduct its business.If the company is unable to attract, motivate and retain experienced and knowledgeable personnel in key positions, its future results could be adversely impacted. The success of the company’s business is dependent upon its ability to employ and train individuals with the requisite knowledge, skills and experience to execute the company’s business model and achieve its business objectives. The failure of the company to retain key personnel or implement an appropriate succession plan could adversely impact the company’s ability to successfully carry out its business strategy and retain other key personnel. The company’s contracts with U.S. governmental agencies may subject the company to audits, criminal penalties, sanctions and other expenses and fines. The company frequently enters into contracts with governmental entities. U.S. government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency and the Department of Labor, routinely audit government contractors. These agencies review a contractor’s performance under its contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. The U.S. government also may review the adequacy of, and a contractor’s compliance with, contract terms and conditions, and its systems and policies, including the contractor’s purchasing, property, estimating, billing, accounting, compensation and management information systems. Any costs found to be overcharged or improperly allocated to a specific contract or any amounts improperly billed or charged for products or services will be subject to reimbursement to the government. In addition, government contractors, such as the company, are required to disclose credible evidence of certain violations of law and contract overcharging to the federal government. If the company is found to have participated in improper or illegal activities, the company may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. government. Any negative publicity related to such contracts, regardless of the accuracy of such publicity, may adversely affect the company’s business or reputation. A significant disruption in the company’s IT systems could adversely affect the company’s business and reputation. We rely extensively on our IT systems to conduct our business and perform services for our clients. Our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, computer viruses and malicious attacks, cybersecurity breaches and catastrophic events. If our systems are accessed without our authorization, damaged or fail to function properly, we could incur substantial repair or replacement costs, experience data loss and impediments to our ability to conduct our business, and damage the market’s perception of our services and products. In addition, a disruption could result in the company failing to meet performance standards and obligations in its client contracts, which could subject the company to liability, penalties and contract termination. This may adversely affect the company’s reputation and financial results. The company may face damage to its reputation or legal liability if its clients are not satisfied with its services or products. The success of the company’s business is dependent on strong, long-term client relationships and on its reputation for responsiveness and quality. As a result, if a client is not satisfied with the company’s services or products, its reputation could be damaged and its business adversely affected. Allegations by private litigants or regulators of improper conduct, as well as negative publicity and press speculation about the company, whatever the outcome and whether or not valid, may harm its reputation. In addition to harm to reputation, if the company fails to meet its contractual obligations, it could be subject to legal liability, which could adversely affect its business, operating results and financial condition.The company could face business and financial risk in implementing future acquisitions or dispositions. As part of the company’s business strategy, it may from time to time consider acquiring complementary technologies, products and businesses, or disposing of existing technologies, products and businesses that may no longer be in alignment with its strategic direction, including transactions of a material size. Any acquisitions may result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness or contingent liabilities. Acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity 12securities and an increase in amortization expenses related to intangible assets. Additional potential risks associated with acquisitions include integration difficulties; difficulties in maintaining or enhancing the profitability of any acquired business; risks of entering markets in which the company has no or limited prior experience; potential loss of employees or failure to maintain or renew any contracts of any acquired business; and expenses of any undiscovered or potential liabilities of the acquired product or business, including relating to employee benefits contribution obligations or environmental requirements. Potential risks with respect to dispositions include difficulty finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner; potential loss of employees or clients; dispositions at unfavorable prices or on unfavorable terms, including relating to retained liabilities; and post-closing indemnity claims. Further, with respect to both acquisitions and dispositions, management’s attention could be diverted from other business concerns. Adverse credit conditions could also affect the company’s ability to consummate acquisitions or dispositions. The risks associated with acquisitions and dispositions could have a material adverse effect upon the company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that the company will be successful in consummating future acquisitions or dispositions on favorable terms or at all.Future results will depend in part on the performance and capabilities of third parties with whom the company has commercial relationships. The company maintains business relationships with suppliers, channel partners and other parties that have complementary products, services or skills. Future results will depend, in part, on the performance and capabilities of these third parties, on the ability of external suppliers to deliver components at reasonable prices and in a timely manner, and on the financial condition of, and the company’s relationship with, distributors and other indirect channel partners, which can affect the company’s capacity to effectively and efficiently serve current and potential customers and end users.An involuntary termination of the company’s U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans would adversely affect the company’s financial condition and results of operations.As of December 31, 2018, the company had approximately $1.4 billion of underfunded pension obligations under its U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the “PBGC”) has authority under the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, to terminate an underfunded defined benefit pension plan under certain circumstances, including when (1) the plan has not met the minimum funding requirements, (2) the plan cannot pay current benefits when due, or (3) the loss to the PBGC is reasonably expected to increase unreasonably over time if the plan is not terminated. If the PBGC were to terminate the company’s U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans, the company’s obligations with respect to such plans would become due and payable in full. Any such event or the failure by the company to pay its pension plan insurance premiums with respect to its U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans could result in the PBGC obtaining a lien on the company’s assets. Such an event would result in an event of default under the company’s debt agreements and would materially and adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.The company’s services or products may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. The company cannot be sure that its services and products do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, and it may have infringement claims asserted against it or against its clients. These claims could cost the company money, prevent it from offering some services or products, or damage its reputation.Legal proceedings could affect the company’s results of operations or cash flow or may adversely affect the company’s business or reputation. There are various lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings that have been brought or asserted against the company, which arise in the ordinary course of business, including actions with respect to commercial and government contracts, labor and employment, employee benefits, environmental matters, intellectual property and non-income tax matters. See Note 15, “Litigation and contingencies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K) (the “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”) for more information on litigation. The company believes that it has valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against it. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, however, and it is possible that the company’s results of operations or cash flows could be materially affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of the legal matters pending against it. Additional legal proceedings may arise in the future with respect to the company’s existing and legacy operations, and may adversely affect the company’s business or reputation.The company’s business can be adversely affected by global economic conditions, acts of war, terrorism or natural disasters.If global economic conditions deteriorate, the company could see reductions in demand and increased pressure on revenue and profit margins. The company could also see a further consolidation of clients, which could also result in a decrease in demand. The company’s business could also be affected by acts of war, terrorism or natural disasters. Current world tensions could escalate, and this could have unpredictable consequences on the world economy and on the company’s business.Other factors discussed in this report, although not listed here, also could materially affect our future results.13"

The information services and technology markets in which the company operates include a large number of companies vying for customers and market share both domestically and internationally. The company’s competitors include systems integrators, consulting and other professional services firms, outsourcing providers, infrastructure services providers, computer hardware manufacturers and software providers. Some of the company’s competitors may develop competing services and products that offer better price-performance or that reach the market in advance of the company’s offerings. Some competitors also have or may develop greater financial and other resources than the company, with enhanced ability to compete for market share, in some instances through significant economic incentives to secure contracts. Some also may be better able to compete for skilled professionals. Any of these factors could lead to reduced demand for the company’s services and products and could have an adverse effect on the company’s business. Future results will depend on the company’s ability to mitigate the effects of aggressive competition on revenues, pricing and margins and on the company’s ability to attract and retain talented people.10Cybersecurity breaches could result in the company incurring significant costs and could harm the company’s business and reputation. The company’s business includes managing, processing, storing and transmitting proprietary and confidential data, including personal information, intellectual property and proprietary business information, within the company’s own IT systems and those that the company designs, develops, hosts or manages for clients. Cybersecurity breaches involving these systems by hackers, other third parties or the company’s employees, despite established security controls, could disrupt these systems or result in the loss or corruption of data or the unauthorized disclosure or misuse of information of the company, its clients or others. This could result in claims, investigations, litigation and legal liability for the company, lead to the loss of existing or potential clients and adversely affect the market’s perception of the security and reliability of the company’s services and products. In addition, such breaches could subject the company to fines and penalties for violations of laws and result in the company incurring other significant costs. This may negatively impact the company’s reputation and financial results.The company has significant pension obligations and required cash contributions and may be required to make additional significant cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans. The company has significant unfunded obligations under its U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. In 2017, the company made cash contributions of $138.4 million to its worldwide defined benefit pension plans. Based on current legislation, global regulations, recent interest rates and expected returns, in 2018 the company estimates that it will make cash contributions to its worldwide defined benefit pension plans of approximately $149.7 million, which are comprised of approximately $86.3 million for the company’s U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan and approximately $63.4 million primarily for non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Although estimates for future cash contributions are likely to change based on a number of factors including market conditions and changes in discount rates, the company currently anticipates that its required cash contributions will increase in 2020 and for the next several years.Deterioration in the value of the company’s worldwide defined benefit pension plan assets, as well as discount rate changes or changes in economic or demographic trends, could require the company to make cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in the future in an amount larger than currently anticipated. Increased cash contribution requirements or an acceleration in the due date of such cash contributions would reduce the cash available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate uses and may have an adverse impact on the company’s operations, financial condition and liquidity.If the company is unable to attract, motivate and retain experienced and knowledgeable personnel in key positions, its future results could be adversely impacted. The success of the company’s business is dependent upon its ability to employ and train individuals with the requisite knowledge, skills and experience to execute the company’s business model and achieve its business objectives. The failure of the company to retain key personnel or implement an appropriate succession plan could adversely impact the company’s ability to successfully carry out its business strategy and retain other key personnel. A significant portion of the company’s revenue is derived from operations outside of the United States, and the company is subject to the risks of doing business internationally. A significant portion of the company’s total revenue is derived from international operations. The risks of doing business internationally include foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, currency restrictions and devaluations, changes in political or economic conditions, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, multiple and possibly overlapping and conflicting tax laws, new tax legislation, weaker intellectual property protections in some jurisdictions and additional legal and regulatory compliance requirements applicable to businesses that operate internationally, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, regulations in the European Union such as the General Data Protection Regulation, the U.K. Bribery Act and other U.S. and non-U.S. laws and regulations.The company’s contracts may not be as profitable as expected or provide the expected level of revenues. In a number of the company’s long-term services contracts, the company’s revenue is based on the volume of services and products provided. As a result, revenue levels anticipated at the contract’s inception are not guaranteed. In addition, some of these contracts may permit termination at the customer’s discretion before the end of the contract’s term or may permit termination or impose other penalties if the company does not meet the performance levels specified in the contracts.The company’s contracts with governmental entities are subject to the availability of appropriated funds. These contracts also contain provisions allowing the governmental entity to terminate the contract at the governmental entity’s discretion before the end of the contract’s term. In addition, if the company’s performance is unacceptable to the customer under a government contract, the government retains the right to pursue remedies under the affected contract, which remedies could include termination.11Certain of the company’s services agreements require that the company’s prices be benchmarked if the customer requests it and provide that those prices may be adjusted downward if the pricing for similar services in the market has changed. As a result, revenues anticipated at the beginning of the terms of these contracts may decline in the future.Some of the company’s services contracts are fixed-price contracts under which the company assumes the risk for delivery of the contracted services and products at an agreed-upon fixed price. Should the company experience problems in performing fixed-price contracts on a profitable basis, adjustments to the estimated cost to complete may be required. Future results will depend on the company’s ability to perform these services contracts profitably.If the company is unable to access the financing markets, it may adversely impact the company’s business and liquidity. Market conditions may impact the company’s ability to access the financing markets on terms acceptable to the company or at all. If the company is unable to access the financing markets, the company would be required to use cash on hand to fund operations and repay outstanding debt as it comes due. There is no assurance that the company will generate sufficient cash to fund its operations and refinance such debt. A failure by the company to generate such cash would have a material adverse effect on its business if the company were unable to access financing markets. Market conditions may also impact the company’s ability to utilize surety bonds, letters of credit, foreign exchange derivatives or other financial instruments the company uses to conduct its business.The company’s contracts with U.S. governmental agencies may subject the company to audits, criminal penalties, sanctions and other expenses and fines. The company frequently enters into contracts with governmental entities. U.S. government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency and the Department of Labor, routinely audit government contractors. These agencies review a contractor’s performance under its contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. The U.S. government also may review the adequacy of, and a contractor’s compliance with, contract terms and conditions, and its systems and policies, including the contractor’s purchasing, property, estimating, billing, accounting, compensation and management information systems. Any costs found to be overcharged or improperly allocated to a specific contract or any amounts improperly billed or charged for products or services will be subject to reimbursement to the government. In addition, government contractors, such as the company, are required to disclose credible evidence of certain violations of law and contract overcharging to the federal government. If the company is found to have participated in improper or illegal activities, the company may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. government. Any negative publicity related to such contracts, regardless of the accuracy of such publicity, may adversely affect the company’s business or reputation. A significant disruption in the company’s IT systems could adversely affect the company’s business and reputation. We rely extensively on our IT systems to conduct our business and perform services for our clients. Our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, computer viruses and malicious attacks, cybersecurity breaches and catastrophic events. If our systems are accessed without our authorization, damaged or fail to function properly, we could incur substantial repair or replacement costs, experience data loss and impediments to our ability to conduct our business, and damage the market’s perception of our services and products. In addition, a disruption could result in the company failing to meet performance standards and obligations in its client contracts, which could subject the company to liability, penalties and contract termination. This may adversely affect the company’s reputation and financial results. The company may face damage to its reputation or legal liability if its clients are not satisfied with its services or products. The success of the company’s business is dependent on strong, long-term client relationships and on its reputation for responsiveness and quality. As a result, if a client is not satisfied with the company’s services or products, its reputation could be damaged and its business adversely affected. Allegations by private litigants or regulators of improper conduct, as well as negative publicity and press speculation about the company, whatever the outcome and whether or not valid, may harm its reputation. In addition to harm to reputation, if the company fails to meet its contractual obligations, it could be subject to legal liability, which could adversely affect its business, operating results and financial condition.Future results will depend in part on the performance and capabilities of third parties with whom the company has commercial relationships. The company maintains business relationships with suppliers, channel partners and other parties that have complementary products, services or skills. Future results will depend, in part, on the performance and capabilities of these third parties, on the ability of external suppliers to deliver components at reasonable prices and in a timely manner, and on the financial condition of, and the company’s relationship with, distributors and other indirect channel partners, which can affect the company’s capacity to effectively and efficiently serve current and potential customers and end users.12An involuntary termination of the company’s U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan would adversely affect the company’s financial condition and results of operations.As of December 31, 2017, the company had approximately $1.3 billion of underfunded pension obligations under its U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the “PBGC”) has authority under the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, to terminate an underfunded defined benefit pension plan under certain circumstances, including when (1) the plan has not met the minimum funding requirements, (2) the plan cannot pay current benefits when due, or (3) the loss to the PBGC is reasonably expected to increase unreasonably over time if the plan is not terminated. If the PBGC were to terminate the company’s U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan, the company’s obligations with respect to such plan would become due and payable in full. Any such event or the failure by the company to pay its pension plan insurance premiums with respect to its U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan could result in the PBGC obtaining a lien on the company’s assets. Such an event would result in an event of default under the company’s debt agreements and would materially and adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.The company’s services or products may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. The company cannot be sure that its services and products do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, and it may have infringement claims asserted against it or against its clients. These claims could cost the company money, prevent it from offering some services or products, or damage its reputation.The company could face business and financial risk in implementing future acquisitions or dispositions. As part of the company’s business strategy, it may from time to time consider acquiring complementary technologies, products and businesses, or disposing of existing technologies, products and businesses that may no longer be in alignment with its strategic direction, including transactions of a material size. Any acquisitions may result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness or contingent liabilities. Acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and an increase in amortization expenses related to intangible assets. Additional potential risks associated with acquisitions include integration difficulties; difficulties in maintaining or enhancing the profitability of any acquired business; risks of entering markets in which the company has no or limited prior experience; potential loss of employees or failure to maintain or renew any contracts of any acquired business; and expenses of any undiscovered or potential liabilities of the acquired product or business, including relating to employee benefits contribution obligations or environmental requirements. Potential risks with respect to dispositions include difficulty finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner; potential loss of employees or clients; dispositions at unfavorable prices or on unfavorable terms, including relating to retained liabilities; and post-closing indemnity claims. Further, with respect to both acquisitions and dispositions, management’s attention could be diverted from other business concerns. Adverse credit conditions could also affect the company’s ability to consummate acquisitions or dispositions. The risks associated with acquisitions and dispositions could have a material adverse effect upon the company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that the company will be successful in consummating future acquisitions or dispositions on favorable terms or at all.The company’s business can be adversely affected by global economic conditions, acts of war, terrorism or natural disasters.The company’s financial results have been impacted by the global economic slowdown in recent years. If economic conditions worsen, the company could see reductions in demand and increased pressure on revenue and profit margins. The company could also see a further consolidation of clients, which could also result in a decrease in demand. The company’s business could also be affected by acts of war, terrorism or natural disasters. Current world tensions could escalate, and this could have unpredictable consequences on the world economy and on the company’s business.Pending litigation could affect the company’s results of operations or cash flow. There are various lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings that have been brought or asserted against the company, which arise in the ordinary course of business, including actions with respect to commercial and government contracts, labor and employment, employee benefits, environmental matters, intellectual property and non-income tax matters. See Note 14, “Litigation and contingencies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on litigation. The company believes that it has valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against it. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, however, and it is possible that the company’s results of operations or cash flows could be materially affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of the legal matters pending against it.Our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented, which may result in a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Management periodically reviews and updates our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of the controls and procedures, or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.13As disclosed in Item 9A. “Controls and Procedures,” a material weakness was identified in our internal control over financial reporting resulting from risk assessment procedures over Technology revenue that did not adequately consider changes in business  operations and the demands on personnel created by the efforts required to adopt the new revenue accounting pronouncement that will impact future financial reporting. As a result, the company had missing process level controls and insufficient trained personnel to operate process level controls over the measurement and recognition of multiple-element arrangements within Technology revenue. Based on this material weakness, management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2017. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company's annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The material weakness did not result in any misstatement of the Company’s consolidated financial statements for any period presented and we are implementing remedial measures intended to address the material weakness and related disclosure controls. However, if the remedial measures we are implementing are insufficient, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting or in our disclosure controls occur in the future, our future consolidated financial statements or other information filed with the SEC may contain material misstatements. Failure to maintain effective controls or to timely implement any necessary improvement of our internal and disclosure controls could, among other things, result in losses from errors, harm our reputation, or cause investors to lose confidence in the reported financial information, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Other factors discussed in this report, although not listed here, also could materially affect our future results.14"
4,UIS,UNISYS CORP,2017-02-21,"ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORSFactors that could affect future results include the following:Future results may be adversely impacted if the company is unable to improve revenue and margins in its services business. The company's strategy places an emphasis on an industry vertical go-to-market approach with an increased focus within the company’s services business on higher value and higher margin offerings. The company’s ability to grow revenue and profitability in this business will depend on the level of demand for projects and the portfolio of solutions the company offers for specific industries. It will also depend on an efficient utilization of services delivery personnel. Revenue and profit margins in this business are a function of both the portfolio of solutions sold in a given period and the rates the company is able to charge for services and the chargeability of its professionals. If the company is unable to attain sufficient rates and chargeability for its professionals, revenue and profit margins will be adversely affected. The rates the company is able to charge for services are affected by a number of factors, including clients’ perception of the company’s ability to add value through its services; introduction of new services or products by the company or its competitors; pricing policies of competitors; and general economic conditions. Chargeability is also affected by a number of factors, including the company’s ability to transition resources from completed projects to new engagements, and its ability to forecast demand for services and thereby maintain appropriate resource levels. The company’s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely impacted if sales of higher margin offerings do not offset declines resulting from a reduced focus on lower margin offerings.Future results may be adversely impacted if the company is unable to maintain its installed base and sell new products in its technology business. The company continues to invest in its ClearPath Forward™ operating system software in order to improve its renewal rate with existing clients in its Technology business. If clients do not believe in the value proposition provided by ClearPath Forward™ or choose not to renew their contracts for any other reason, there may not be a meaningful return on these investments, and revenue could decline meaningfully. The company also continues to invest in its Stealth® family of software, as well as in industry-specific software for its target sectors and focus industries. If the company is unsuccessful in selling these Stealth® products or industry-specific software and related services, there may not be a meaningful return on these investments. Further, the revenues generated by Stealth® and other new software and related services may be insufficient to offset any revenue declines caused if the company is unable to retain its installed base.The company’s future results may be adversely impacted if it is unable to effectively anticipate and respond to volatility and rapid technological innovation in its industry. The company operates in a highly volatile industry characterized by rapid technological innovation, evolving technology standards, short product life cycles and continually changing customer demand patterns. Future success will depend in part on the company’s ability to anticipate and respond to these market trends and to design, develop, introduce, deliver or obtain new and innovative services and products on a timely and cost-effective basis using new delivery models such as cloud computing. The company may not be successful in anticipating or responding to changes in technology, industry standards or customer preferences, and the market may not demand or accept its services and product offerings. In addition, services and products developed by competitors may make the company’s offerings less competitive.If the company is unable to access the financing markets, it may adversely impact the company’s business and liquidity. Market conditions may impact the company’s ability to access the financing markets on terms acceptable to the company or at all. If the company is unable to access the financing markets, the company would be required to use cash on hand to fund operations and repay outstanding debt, including the company’s remaining 6.25% senior notes due August 15, 2017 and repay any amounts it may borrow under the company’s secured revolving credit facility. There is no assurance that the company will be able to generate sufficient cash to fund its operations and refinance such debt. A failure by the company to generate such cash would have a material adverse effect on its business if the company were unable to access financing markets. Additionally, even if the company is able to generate sufficient cash to refinance such debt, the company may need to delay the completion of its remaining cost reduction initiatives in some jurisdictions and cash available to the company for working capital and other corporate uses could be reduced. Market conditions may also impact the company’s ability to utilize surety bonds, letters of credit, foreign exchange derivatives or other financial instruments the company uses to conduct its business.In addition, the company has had, and continues to have, discussions regarding potential debt and other financing transactions with a variety of sources and on a variety of structures and terms. There is no assurance that the company will consummate a transaction with any potential financing sources or what the terms of any such transaction would be.The company has significant pension obligations and may be required to make additional significant cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans. The company has significant unfunded obligations under its U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. In 2016, the company made cash contributions of $132.5 million to its worldwide defined benefit pension plans. Based on current legislation, global regulations, recent interest rates and expected returns, in 2017 the company estimates that it will make cash 10contributions to its worldwide defined benefit pension plans of approximately $127.7 million, which are comprised of approximately $54.4 million for the company’s U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan and approximately $73.3 million primarily for non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Although estimates for future cash contributions are likely to change based on a number of factors including market conditions, changes in discount rates and, with respect to the company’s international plans, changes in currency rates, the company currently expects to be required to make cash contributions to its worldwide defined benefit pension plans in 2017 in an amount similar to its contributions in 2016. The company also currently anticipates that its required cash contributions will increase in 2018 and beyond.Deterioration in the value of the company’s worldwide defined benefit pension plan assets, as well as discount rate changes or changes in economic or demographic trends, could require the company to make cash contributions to its defined benefit pension plans in the future in an amount larger than currently anticipated. In addition, the funding of non-U.S. plan deficits over a shorter period of time than currently anticipated could result in making cash contributions to these plans on a more accelerated basis. Increased cash contribution requirements or an acceleration in the due date of such cash contributions would reduce the cash available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate uses and may have an adverse impact on the company’s operations, financial condition and liquidity.The company’s future results may be adversely affected if the company does not realize additional anticipated cost savings or is unable to successfully implement its cost reduction initiatives to drive efficiencies across all of its operations. In recent years, the company has implemented significant cost-reduction measures and a long-term business strategy to create a more competitive cost structure, simplify its operations and rebalance the company’s global skill set. While the company currently expects to generate additional anticipated cost savings by the conclusion of the program in 2017, there can be no assurance that the company will achieve these savings goals and it expects that it will have to make additional investments in order to do so. In addition, if the company does not manage any related headcount reductions or other cost-cutting measures effectively or timely or is unable to provide services more cost-efficiently, the company’s ability to implement its long-term business strategy could be adversely impacted and it could materially affect the company’s business, results of operations and financial condition.The company’s future results will depend on its ability to retain significant clients. The company has a number of significant long-term contracts with clients, including governmental entities, and its future success will depend, in part, on retaining its relationships with these clients. The company could lose clients for reasons such as contract expiration, conversion to a competing service provider, dissatisfaction with the company’s efficiency initiatives, disputes with clients or a decision to in-source services, including contracts with governmental entities as part of the rebid process. The company could also lose clients as a result of their merger, acquisition or business failure. The company may not be able to replace the revenue and earnings from any such lost client.The company faces aggressive competition in the information services and technology marketplace, which could lead to reduced demand for the company’s services and products and could have an adverse effect on the company’s business. The information services and technology markets in which the company operates include a large number of companies vying for customers and market share both domestically and internationally. The company’s competitors include consulting and other professional services firms, systems integrators, outsourcing providers, infrastructure services providers, computer hardware manufacturers and software providers. Some of the company’s competitors may develop competing services and products that offer better price-performance or that reach the market in advance of the company’s offerings. Some competitors also have or may develop greater financial and other resources than the company, with enhanced ability to compete for market share, in some instances through significant economic incentives to secure contracts. Some also may be better able to compete for skilled professionals. Any of these factors could lead to reduced demand for the company’s services and products and could have an adverse effect on the company’s business. Future results will depend on the company’s ability to mitigate the effects of aggressive competition on revenues, pricing and margins and on the company’s ability to attract and retain talented people.Cybersecurity breaches could result in the company incurring significant costs and could harm the company’s business and reputation. The company’s business includes managing, processing, storing and transmitting proprietary and confidential data, including personal information, intellectual property and proprietary business information, within the company’s own IT systems and those that the company designs, develops, hosts or manages for clients. Cybersecurity breaches involving these systems by hackers, other third parties or the company’s employees, despite established security controls, could disrupt these systems or result in the loss or corruption of data or the unauthorized disclosure or misuse of information of the company, its clients or others. This could result in claims, investigations, litigation and legal liability for the company, lead to the loss of existing or potential clients and adversely affect the market’s perception of the security and reliability of the company’s services and products. In addition, such breaches could subject the company to fines and penalties for violations of laws and result in the company incurring other significant costs. This may negatively impact the company’s reputation and financial results.11If the company is unable to attract, motivate and retain experienced and knowledgeable personnel in key positions, its future results could be adversely impacted. The success of the company’s business is dependent upon its ability to employ and train individuals with the requisite knowledge, skills and experience to execute the company’s business model and achieve its business objectives. The failure of the company to retain key personnel or implement an appropriate succession plan could adversely impact the company’s ability to successfully carry out its business strategy and retain other key personnel. A significant portion of the company’s revenue is derived from operations outside of the United States, and the company is subject to the risks of doing business internationally. A significant portion of the company’s total revenue is derived from international operations. The risks of doing business internationally include foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, currency restrictions and devaluations, changes in political or economic conditions, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, multiple and possibly overlapping and conflicting tax laws, new tax legislation, weaker intellectual property protections in some jurisdictions and additional legal and regulatory compliance requirements applicable to businesses that operate internationally, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and non-U.S. laws and regulations.The company’s contracts may not be as profitable as expected or provide the expected level of revenues. In a number of the company’s long-term services contracts, the company’s revenue is based on the volume of services and products provided. As a result, revenue levels anticipated at the contract’s inception are not guaranteed. In addition, some of these contracts may permit termination at the customer’s discretion before the end of the contract’s term or may permit termination or impose other penalties if the company does not meet the performance levels specified in the contracts.The company’s contracts with governmental entities are subject to the availability of appropriated funds. These contracts also contain provisions allowing the governmental entity to terminate the contract at the governmental entity’s discretion before the end of the contract’s term. In addition, if the company’s performance is unacceptable to the customer under a government contract, the government retains the right to pursue remedies under the affected contract, which remedies could include termination.Certain of the company’s services agreements require that the company’s prices be benchmarked if the customer requests it and provide that those prices may be adjusted downward if the pricing for similar services in the market has changed. As a result, revenues anticipated at the beginning of the terms of these contracts may decline in the future.Some of the company’s services contracts are fixed-price contracts under which the company assumes the risk for delivery of the contracted services and products at an agreed-upon fixed price. Should the company experience problems in performing fixed-price contracts on a profitable basis, adjustments to the estimated cost to complete may be required. Future results will depend on the company’s ability to perform these services contracts profitably.The company’s contracts with U.S. governmental agencies may subject the company to audits, criminal penalties, sanctions and other expenses and fines. The company frequently enters into contracts with governmental entities. U.S. government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency and the Department of Labor, routinely audit government contractors. These agencies review a contractor’s performance under its contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. The U.S. government also may review the adequacy of, and a contractor’s compliance with, contract terms and conditions, and its systems and policies, including the contractor’s purchasing, property, estimating, billing, accounting, compensation and management information systems. Any costs found to be overcharged or improperly allocated to a specific contract or any amounts improperly billed or charged for products or services will be subject to reimbursement to the government. In addition, government contractors, such as the company, are required to disclose credible evidence of certain violations of law and contract overcharging to the federal government. If the company is found to have participated in improper or illegal activities, the company may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. government. Any negative publicity related to such contracts, regardless of the accuracy of such publicity, may adversely affect the company’s business or reputation. A significant disruption in the company’s IT systems could adversely affect the company’s business and reputation. We rely extensively on our IT systems to conduct our business and perform services for our clients. Our systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, telecommunications failures, computer viruses and malicious attacks, cybersecurity breaches and catastrophic events. If our systems are accessed without our authorization, damaged or fail to function properly, we could incur substantial repair or replacement costs, experience data loss and impediments to our ability to conduct our business, and damage the market’s perception of our services and products. In addition, a disruption could result in the company failing to meet performance standards and obligations in its client contracts, which could subject the company to liability, penalties and contract termination. This may adversely affect the company’s reputation and financial results. 12The company may face damage to its reputation or legal liability if its clients are not satisfied with its services or products. The success of the company’s business is dependent on strong, long-term client relationships and on its reputation for responsiveness and quality. As a result, if a client is not satisfied with the company’s services or products, its reputation could be damaged and its business adversely affected. Allegations by private litigants or regulators of improper conduct, as well as negative publicity and press speculation about the company, whatever the outcome and whether or not valid, may harm its reputation. In addition to harm to reputation, if the company fails to meet its contractual obligations, it could be subject to legal liability, which could adversely affect its business, operating results and financial condition.Future results will depend in part on the performance and capabilities of third parties with whom the company has commercial relationships. The company maintains business relationships with suppliers, channel partners and other parties that have complementary products, services or skills. Future results will depend, in part, on the performance and capabilities of these third parties, on the ability of external suppliers to deliver components at reasonable prices and in a timely manner, and on the financial condition of, and the company’s relationship with, distributors and other indirect channel partners, which can affect the company’s capacity to effectively and efficiently serve current and potential customers and end users.A termination of the company’s U.S. defined benefit pension plan would adversely affect the company’s financial condition and results of operations.As of December 31, 2016, the company had approximately $1.52 billion of unfunded pension obligations under its U.S. defined benefit pension plan.  The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the “PBGC”) has authority under the Employment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, to terminate an underfunded defined benefit pension plan under certain circumstances, including when (1) the plan has not met the minimum funding requirements, (2) the plan cannot pay current benefits when due, or (3) the loss to the PBGC is reasonably expected to increase unreasonably over time if the plan is not terminated. If the PBGC were to terminate the company’s U.S. defined benefit pension plan, the company’s obligations with respect to such plan would become due and payable in full. Any such event or the failure by the company to pay its pension plan insurance premiums with respect to its U.S. defined benefit pension plan could result in the PBGC obtaining a lien on the company’s assets. Such an event would result in an event of default under the company’s debt agreements and would materially and adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.The company’s business can be adversely affected by global economic conditions, acts of war, terrorism or natural disasters.The company’s financial results have been impacted by the global economic slowdown in recent years. If economic conditions worsen, the company could see reductions in demand and increased pressure on revenue and profit margins. The company could also see a further consolidation of clients, which could also result in a decrease in demand. The company’s business could also be affected by acts of war, terrorism or natural disasters. Current world tensions could escalate, and this could have unpredictable consequences on the world economy and on the company’s business.The company’s services or products may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others. The company cannot be sure that its services and products do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, and it may have infringement claims asserted against it or against its clients. These claims could cost the company money, prevent it from offering some services or products, or damage its reputation.Pending litigation could affect the company’s results of operations or cash flow. There are various lawsuits, claims, investigations and proceedings that have been brought or asserted against the company, which arise in the ordinary course of business, including actions with respect to commercial and government contracts, labor and employment, employee benefits, environmental matters, intellectual property and non-income tax matters. See Note 14, ""Litigation and contingencies,"" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on litigation. The company believes that it has valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against it. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, however, and it is possible that the company’s results of operations or cash flows could be materially affected in any particular period by the resolution of one or more of the legal matters pending against it.The company could face business and financial risk in implementing future dispositions or acquisitions. As part of the company’s business strategy, it may from time to time consider disposing of existing technologies, products and businesses that may no longer be in alignment with its strategic direction, including transactions of a material size, or acquiring complementary technologies, products and businesses. Potential risks with respect to dispositions include difficulty finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner; potential loss of employees or clients; dispositions at unfavorable prices or on unfavorable terms, including relating to retained liabilities; and post-closing indemnity claims. Any acquisitions may result in the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness or contingent liabilities. Acquisitions could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and an increase in amortization expenses related to intangible assets. Additional potential risks associated with acquisitions include integration difficulties; difficulties in maintaining or enhancing the profitability of any acquired business; risks of entering markets in which the company has no or limited prior experience; 13potential loss of employees or failure to maintain or renew any contracts of any acquired business; and expenses of any undiscovered or potential liabilities of the acquired product or business, including relating to employee benefits contribution obligations or environmental requirements. Further, with respect to both dispositions and acquisitions, management’s attention could be diverted from other business concerns. Adverse credit conditions could also affect the company’s ability to consummate dispositions or acquisitions. The risks associated with dispositions and acquisitions could have a material adverse effect upon the company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that the company will be successful in consummating future dispositions or acquisitions on favorable terms or at all.Other factors discussed in this report, although not listed here, also could materially affect our future results.14"
