6,COHR,COHERENT INC,2023-08-18,"    RISK FACTORSThe following are certain risk factors that could affect our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. These risk factors should be considered along with the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, because these factors could cause our actual results or financial condition to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. The following discussion is not an all-inclusive listing of risks, although we believe these are the material risks that we face. If any of the following occur, our business, results of operations, financial position, or cash flows could be adversely affected. You should carefully consider these factors, as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, when evaluating an investment in our securities. Risks Relating to Our Business and Our IndustryInvestments in future markets of potential significant growth may not result in the expected return. We continue to make investments in programs with the goal of gaining a greater share of end markets using laser systems, semiconductor lasers and other components. We cannot guarantee that our investments in capital and capabilities will be sufficient. The potential end markets, as well as our ability to gain market share in such markets, may not materialize on the timeline anticipated or at all. We cannot be sure of the end market price, specification, or yield for products incorporating our technologies. Our technologies could fail to fulfill, partially or completely, our target customers’ specifications. We cannot guarantee the end market customers’ acceptance of our technologies. Further, we may be unable to fulfill the terms of our contracts with our target customers, which could result in penalties of a material nature, including damages, loss of market share, and loss of reputation.Our competitive position depends on our ability to develop new products and processes. To meet our strategic objectives, we must develop, manufacture, and market new products and continue to update our existing products and processes to keep pace sudden increases in market demand and other market developments to address increasingly sophisticated customer requirements. Our success in developing and selling new and enhanced products and processes depends upon a variety of factors, including strategic product selection, efficient completion of product design and development, timely implementation of manufacturing and assembly processes, effective sales and marketing, and high-quality and successful product performance in the market.The introduction by our competitors of products or processes using new developments that are better or lower cost than ours could render our products or processes obsolete or unmarketable. We intend to continue to make significant investments in research, development, and engineering to achieve our goals. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new products or enhancements to our existing products and processes in a manner which satisfies customer needs or achieves market acceptance. The failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business and maintain our competitive position and on our results of operations and/or financial condition.Our products may contain defects that are not detected until deployed, which could increase our costs, reduce our revenues, cause us to lose key customers, or expose us to litigation related to our products. Some systems that use our products are inherently complex in design. As a result of the technological complexity of our products, in particular our excimer laser annealing tools used in the display capital equipment market, changes in our or our suppliers’ manufacturing processes or the inadvertent use of defective materials by us or our suppliers could result in a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields and product reliability. Our customers may also discover defects in our products after the products have been fully deployed and operated under peak stress conditions. In addition, some of our products are combined with products from other vendors which may contain defects. Should problems occur, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. If we are unable to correct defects or other problems, we could experience, among other things, loss of customers, increased costs of product returns and warranty expenses, damage to our brand reputation, failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance, diversion of development and engineering resources, or legal action by our customers. The occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.Our competitive position may still require significant investments. 26We continuously monitor the marketplace for strategic opportunities, and our business strategy includes expanding our product lines and markets through both internal product development and acquisitions. Consequently, we expect to continue to consider strategic acquisition of businesses, products, or technologies complementary to our business. This may require significant investments of management time and financial resources. If market demand is outside our organic capabilities, if a strategic acquisition is required and we cannot identify one or execute on it, and/or if financial investments that we undertake distract management, do not result in the expected return on investment, expose us to unforeseen liabilities, or jeopardize our ability to comply with our credit facility covenants due to any inability to integrate the business, adjust to operating a larger and more complex organization, adapt to additional political and other requirements associated with the acquired business, retain staff, or work with customers, we could suffer a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.We may be unable to successfully implement our acquisitions strategy or integrate acquired companies and personnel with existing operations. We have acquired several companies, including Finisar Corporation in September 2019 and Legacy Coherent in July 2022. We expect to expand and diversify our operations with additional acquisitions, but we may be unable to identify or complete prospective acquisitions for many reasons, including increasing competition from other potential acquirers, the effects of consolidation in our industries, and potentially high valuations of acquisition candidates. In addition, applicable competition laws and other regulations may limit our ability to acquire targets, integrate businesses, or force us to divest an acquired business line. If we are unable to identify suitable targets or complete acquisitions, our growth prospects may suffer, and we may not be able to realize sufficient scale and technological advantages to compete effectively in all markets. To the extent that we complete acquisitions, we may be unsuccessful in integrating acquired companies or product lines with existing operations, or the integration may be more difficult or more costly than anticipated. We incurred substantial expenses related to the acquisition of Legacy Coherent and we continue to incur substantial expenses related to the integration of Legacy Coherent and its subsidiaries. Some of the risks that may affect our ability to integrate or realize anticipated benefits from acquired companies, businesses, or assets include those associated with: •unexpected losses of key employees of the acquired company; •standardizing the combined company’s standards, processes, procedures, and controls, including integrating enterprise resource planning systems and other key business applications; •coordinating new product and process development; •increasing complexity from combining operations; •increasing the scope, geographic diversity, and complexity of our operations; •difficulties in consolidating facilities and transferring processes and know-how; •diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns; and•actions we may take in connection with acquisitions, such as: ◦using a significant portion of our available cash; ◦issuing equity securities, which would dilute current shareholders’ percentage ownership; ◦incurring significant debt; ◦incurring or assume contingent liabilities, known or unknown, including potential lawsuits, infringement actions, or similar liabilities; ◦incurring impairment charges related to goodwill or other intangibles; and ◦facing antitrust or other regulatory inquiries or actions.In addition, the market prices of our outstanding securities could be adversely affected if the effect of any acquisitions on our consolidated financial results is dilutive or is below the market’s or financial analysts’ expectations, or if there are unanticipated changes in the business or financial performance of the acquired or combined company. Any failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses may disrupt our business and adversely impact our business, results of operations, or financial condition.Although we expect that our acquisitions will result in cost savings, synergies, and other benefits, we may not realize those benefits, or be able to retain those benefits even if realized.The success of our acquisitions will depend in large part on our success in integrating the acquired operations, strategies, technologies, and personnel. We may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of an acquisition if the integration process takes longer than expected or is more costly than expected. If we fail to meet the challenges involved in successfully integrating any acquired operations or to otherwise realize any of the anticipated benefits of an acquisition, including any expected cost savings and synergies, our operations could be impaired. In addition, the overall integration of an acquired business can be a time-consuming and expensive process that, without proper planning and effective and timely implementation, could significantly disrupt our business.27Potential difficulties that we may encounter in the integration process include:•the integration of management teams, strategies, technologies and operations, products, and services;•the disruption of ongoing businesses and distraction of their respective management teams from ongoing business concerns;•the retention of, and possible decrease in business from, existing customers;•the creation of uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies, and information systems; •the reduction of the costs associated with combined operations;•the integration of corporate cultures and maintenance of employee morale;•the retention of key employees; and•potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired business.The anticipated cost savings, synergies, and other benefits of any acquisition typically assume a successful integration of the acquired business and are based on projections and other assumptions, which are inherently uncertain. Even if integration is successful, anticipated cost savings, synergies, and other benefits may not be achieved.Our future success depends on continued international sales, and our global operations are complex and present multiple challenges to manage. We anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. The failure to maintain our current volume of international sales could materially affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and/or cash flows. We manufacture products in numerous countries worldwide. Our operations vary by location and are influenced on a location-by-location basis by local customs, languages, and work practices, as well as different local weather conditions, management styles, and education systems. In addition, multiple complex issues may arise concurrently in different countries, potentially hampering our ability to respond in an effective and timely manner. Any inability to respond in an effective and timely manner to issues in our global operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.We are subject to complex and rapidly changing import and export regulations which could limit our sales and decrease our profitability, and we may be subject to legal and regulatory consequences if we do not comply with applicable export control laws and regulations.Obtaining export licenses can be difficult, time-consuming and require interpretation of complex regulations. Failure to obtain and/or retain export licenses for these shipments could significantly reduce our revenue and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and relationships with our customers. Additionally, failure to comply with the various regulatory requirements could subject us to significant fines, suspension of export privileges or disbarment. Additionally, we are subject to the passage of and changes in the interpretation of regulation by U.S. government entities at the federal, state, and local levels and by non-U.S. agencies, including, but not limited to, the following: •We are required to comply with import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our ability to enter into or complete transactions with certain customers, business partners, and other persons. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services, and technologies. We may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item, and granting of a required license cannot be assured. Compliance with the import laws that apply to our businesses may restrict our access to, and may increase the cost of obtaining, certain products and could interrupt our supply of imported inventory.•Exported technologies, including, but not limited to, equipment necessary to develop and manufacture certain products are subject to U.S. export control laws and similar laws of other jurisdictions. We may be subject to adverse regulatory consequences, including government oversight of facilities and export transactions, monetary penalties, and other sanctions for violations of these laws. In certain instances, these regulations may prohibit us from developing or manufacturing certain of our products for specific applications outside the United States. Failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary, and nonmonetary penalties; disruptions to our business; limitations on our ability to import and export products and services; and damage to our reputation.We may fail to accurately estimate the size and growth rate of our markets and our customers’ demands.We make significant decisions based on our estimates of customer requirements. We use our estimates to determine the levels of business we seek and accept, production schedules, personnel needs, and other resource requirements.28Customers may require rapid increases in production on short notice. We may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or allocate sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet such increases in demand. Rapid customer ramp-up and significant increases in demand may strain our resources or negatively affect our margins. Inability to satisfy customer demand in a timely manner may harm our reputation, reduce our other opportunities, damage our relationships with customers, reduce revenue growth, and/or cause us to incur contractual penalties. Alternatively, downturns in the industries in which we compete may cause our customers to significantly and abruptly reduce their demand, or even cancel orders. With respect to orders we initiate with our suppliers to address anticipated demand from our customers, certain suppliers may have required noncancellable purchase commitments or advance payments from us, and those obligations and commitments could reduce our ability to adjust our inventory or expense levels to reflect declining market demands. Unexpected declines in customer demands can result in excess or obsolete inventory and additional charges. Because certain of our sales, research and development, and internal manufacturing overhead expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in customer demand likely would decrease our gross margins and operating income.We may encounter increased competition, and we may fail to accurately estimate our competitors’ or our customers’ willingness and capability to backward integrate into our competencies and thereby displace us. We may encounter substantial competition from other companies in the same market, including established companies with significant resources. Some of our competitors may have financial, technical, marketing, or other capabilities that are more extensive than ours. They may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and other competitive pressures. We may not be able to compete successfully against our present or future competitors. Our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.A significant portion of our business may be subject to cyclical market factors. Our business is dependent on the demand for products produced by end-users of industrial, communications, electronics, and instrumentation markets. Many of these end-users are in industries that have historically experienced a highly cyclical demand for their products. As a result, demand for our products is subject to these cyclical fluctuations. Fluctuations in demand could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.The long sales cycles for many of our products may cause us to incur significant expenses. Customers often view the purchase of our products as a significant and strategic decision. As a result, customers typically expend significant effort in evaluating, testing and qualifying our products before making a decision to purchase them, resulting in a lengthy design-in sales cycle. While our customers are evaluating our products and before they place an order with us, we may incur substantial sales and marketing and research and development expenses to customize our products to the customers’ needs. We may also expend significant management efforts, increase manufacturing capacity and increase inventory of long lead-time components or materials prior to receiving an order. Even after this evaluation process, a potential customer may not purchase our products. As a result, these long sales cycles may cause us to incur significant expenses without ever receiving revenues to offset such expenses.We have entered into supply agreements that commit us to supply products on specified terms. We have supply agreements with some customers that require us to supply products and allocate sufficient capacity to make these products. We have also agreed to pricing schedules and methodologies that could result in penalties if we fail to meet development, supply, capacity, and quality commitments. Failure to do so may cause us to be unable to generate the amount of revenue or the level of profitability we expect from these arrangements. Our ability to realize a profit under some of these agreements will be subject to the level of customer demand, the cost of maintaining facilities and manufacturing capacity, and supply chain capability. If we fail to fulfill our commitments under these supply agreements, our business, after using all remedies available, financial conditions, and results of operations may suffer a material adverse effect.We depend on highly complex manufacturing processes that require strategic materials, components, and products from limited sources of supply. Our operations are dependent upon a supply chain of difficult-to-make or difficult-to-refine products and materials, including integrated circuits, mechanical housings and optical components, and some of our product inflow is subject to yield reductions from growth or fabrication losses, and thus the quantities we may receive are not consistently predictable. Customers may also change a specification for a product that our suppliers cannot meet which may limit and/or otherwise impact our ability to supply such customers.29Some of our products, for example in the OLED display industry, require designs and specifications that are at the cutting-edge of available technologies and change frequently to meet rapidly evolving market demands. By their very nature, the types of components used in such products can be difficult and unpredictable to manufacture and may only be available from a single supplier, which increases the risk that we may not obtain such components in a timely manner. Identifying alternative sources of supply for certain components could be difficult and costly, result in management distraction in assisting our current and future suppliers to meet our and our customers’ technical requirements, and cause delays in shipments of our products while we identify, evaluate and test the products of alternative suppliers. Any such delay in shipment would result in a delay or cancellation of our ability to convert such order into revenues. Furthermore, financial or other difficulties faced by these suppliers or significant changes in demand for these components or materials could limit their availability. We continue to consolidate our supply base and move supplier locations. When we transition locations, we may increase our inventory of such products as a “safety stock” during the transition, which may cause the amount of inventory reflected on our balance sheet to increase. Additionally, many of our customers rely on sole source suppliers. In the event of a disruption of our customers' supply chain, orders from our customers could decrease or be delayed.We also make products of which we are one of the world’s largest suppliers. We use high-quality, optical-grade ZnSe in the production of many of our IR optical products. We are a leading producer of ZnSe for our internal use and for external sale. The production of ZnSe is a complex process requiring a highly controlled environment. A number of factors, including defective or contaminated materials, could adversely affect our ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields of high-quality ZnSe. Lack of adequate availability of high-quality ZnSe could have a material adverse effect upon our business. There can be no assurance that we will not experience manufacturing yield inefficiencies that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. We produce hydrogen selenide gas, which is used in our production of ZnSe. There are risks inherent in the production and handling of such material. Our lack of proper handling of hydrogen selenide could require us to curtail our production of the gas. Our potential inability to internally produce hydrogen selenide could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. In addition, we use rare earth minerals and produce and use high-purity and relatively uncommon materials and compounds to manufacture our products, including, but not limited to, ZnS, GaAs, yttrium aluminum garnet, yttrium lithium fluoride, calcium fluoride, germanium, selenium, telluride, Bi2Te3, and SiC. A significant failure of our internal production processes or our suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of these necessary materials (including, in the case of rare earth minerals, as a consequence of their limited diminished availability) on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.Furthermore, we have historically relied exclusively on our own production capability to manufacture certain strategic components, crystals, semiconductor lasers, fiber, lasers and laser-based systems. We also manufacture certain large format optics. Because we manufacture, package and test these components, products and systems at our own facilities, and such components, products and systems are not readily available from other sources, any interruption in manufacturing would adversely affect our business.We participate in the semiconductor capital equipment market, which requires significant research and development expenses to develop and maintain products, and a failure to achieve market acceptance for our products could have a significant negative impact on our business and results of operations.The semiconductor capital equipment market is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent product introductions, the volatility of product supply and demand, changing customer requirements and evolving industry standards. The nature of this market requires significant research and development expenses to participate, with substantial resources invested in advance of material sales of our products to our customers in this market. Additionally, our product offerings may become obsolete given the frequent introduction of alternative technologies. In the event either our customers’ or our products fail to gain market acceptance, or the semiconductor capital equipment market fails to grow, it would likely have a significant negative effect on our business and results of operations.There are risks associated with our participation in the display capital equipment market, including as a result of there being a relatively limited number of end customer manufacturers. In the display capital equipment market, it is unclear when the timing will be, or whether it will occur at all, for any further build-out of fabs for the manufacture of OLED screens, and there are a relatively limited number of manufacturers who are the end customers for our annealing products. Given macroeconomic conditions, varying consumer demand and technical process limitations at manufacturers, we may see fluctuations in orders, including periods with no or few orders, and our customers may seek to reschedule or cancel orders.30Additionally, challenges in meeting evolving technological requirements for these complex products by us and our suppliers could result in delays in shipments and rescheduled or cancelled orders by our customers. This could negatively impact our backlog, timing of revenues and results of operations.The Laser segment service revenue can experience fluctuations driven by market demand as well as customer factors such as inventory management and the ability to run some systems at lower power levels during times of lower demand from their external customers. This can impact short-term service demand and cause some fluctuations in the Laser segment service revenues.Increases in commodity prices and diminished availability of rare earth minerals and noble gases may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of increases in commodity prices and diminished availability of rare earth minerals and noble gases. Our businesses purchase, produce, and sell raw materials based upon quoted market prices from minor metal exchanges. The negative impact from increases in commodity prices and diminished availability of rare earth minerals and noble gases might not be recovered through our product sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings and financial condition.Changes in trade policies, such as increased import duties, could increase the costs of goods imported into the United States or China. In March 2018, the United States announced new steel and aluminum tariffs. Then, in July 2018, the United States imposed increased tariffs on products of Chinese origin, and China responded by increasing tariffs on U.S.-origin goods. On the export side, denial orders and placing companies on the U.S. Entity List could decrease our access to customers and markets and materially impact our revenues in the aggregate. In April 2018, for example, the U.S. Department of Commerce issued a denial order against two companies in the telecommunications market. In 2019 and 2020, the U.S. Department of Commerce placed a number of entities on the U.S. Entity List. If we cannot obtain relief from, or take other action to mitigate the impact of, these additional duties and restrictions and duties, our business and profits may be materially and adversely affected. Further changes in the trade policy of the United States or of other countries in which we do cross-border business, or additional sanctions, could result in retaliatory actions by other countries that could materially and negatively impact the volume of economic activity in the United States or globally, which, in turn, may decrease our access to customers and markets, reduce our revenues, and increase our operating costs. Our association with customers that are or become subject to U.S. regulatory scrutiny or export restrictions could negatively impact our business and create instability in our operations. Governmental actions such as these could subject us to actual or perceived reputational harm among current or prospective investors, suppliers or customers, customers of our customers, other parties doing business with us, or the general public. Any such reputational harm could result in the loss of investors, suppliers, or customers, which could harm our business, financial condition, operating results, or prospects.Exports of certain of our products are subject to export controls imposed by the U.S. government and administered by the U.S. Departments of State and Commerce. In certain instances, these regulations may require pre-shipment authorization from the administering department. For products subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), administered by the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security, the requirement for a license is dependent on the type and end use of the product, the final destination, the identity of the end user, and whether a license exception might apply. Virtually all exports of products subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), administered by the Department of State’s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, require a license. Certain of our products are subject to EAR controls. Additionally, certain other products that we sell, including certain products developed with government funding, are subject to ITAR. Products developed and manufactured in our foreign locations are subject to export controls of the applicable foreign nation. Given the current global political climate, obtaining export licenses can be difficult and time-consuming. Failure to obtain export licenses for these shipments, or having one or more of our customers be restricted from receiving exports from us, could significantly reduce our revenue and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Compliance with regulations of the United States and other governments also subjects us to additional fees and costs. The absence of comparable restrictions on competitors in other countries may adversely affect our competitive position. A widespread health crisis could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.The outbreak of a widespread health crisis, whether global in scope or localized in an area in which we, our customers or our suppliers do business, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and the operations of our suppliers and customers. Potential impacts on our operations include:•significant reductions in demand for one or more of our products or a curtailment to one or more of our product lines caused by, among other things, any temporary inability of our customers to purchase and utilize our products in next-stage manufacturing due to shutdown orders or financial hardship;31•workforce constraints triggered by any applicable shutdown orders or stay-at-home polices; •disruptions to our third-party manufacturing and raw materials supply arrangements caused by constraints over our suppliers’ workforce capacity, financial, or operational difficulties;•disruption in our own ability to produce and ship products, including components we use in the production of other products;•heightened risk and uncertainty regarding the loss or disruption of essential third-party service providers, including transportation services, contract manufacturing, marketing, and distribution services;•requirements to comply with governmental and regulatory responses such as quarantines, import/export restrictions, price controls, or other governmental or regulatory actions, including closures or other restrictions that limit or close our operating and manufacturing facilities, restrict our workforce’s ability to travel or perform necessary business functions, or otherwise impact our suppliers or customers, which could adversely impact our operating results; and•increased operating expenses and potentially reduced efficiency of operations. For example, in response to the global novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), we have focused intensely on mitigating the adverse impacts of COVID-19 on our foreign and domestic operations and modified our business practices for the continued health and safety of our employees. We may take further actions, or be required to take further actions, that are in the best interests of our employees. Our suppliers, distributors and customers also implemented measures, which to mitigate the adverse impacts of COVID-19, which resulted in, and may continue to result in, disruptions or delays and higher costs. While we believe that we have been successful in identifying, managing, and mitigating the economic disruption impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on us, we cannot provide any assurance that we similarly will be able to mitigate the impacts of any future widespread health crises, including as a result of any variants of COVID-19. The implementation of health and safety practices by us or our suppliers, distributors or customers could impact customer demand, supplier deliveries, our productivity, and costs, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Global economic downturns may adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. Current and future conditions in the global economy have an inherent degree of uncertainty. As a result, it is difficult to estimate the level of growth or contraction of the global economy as a whole. It is even more difficult to estimate growth or contraction in various parts, sectors, and regions of the economy, including the industrial, communications, electronics and instrumentation markets in which we participate. All aspects of our forecasts depend on estimates of growth or contraction in the markets we serve. Thus, prevailing global economic uncertainties render estimates of future income and expenditures very difficult to make. Global economic downturns may affect industries in which our customers operate. These changes could include decreases in the rate of consumption or use of our customers’ products. Such conditions could have a material adverse effect on demand for our customers’ products and, in turn, on demand for our products. Adverse changes may occur in the future as a result of declining or flat global or regional economic conditions, fluctuations in currency and commodity prices, wavering confidence, capital expenditure reductions, unemployment, decline in stock markets, contraction of credit availability, or other factors affecting economic conditions. For example, factors that may affect our operating results include disruption in the credit and financial markets in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere, adverse effects of slowdowns in the U.S., European, Chinese or other Asian economies, reductions or limited growth in consumer spending or consumer credit, global trade tariffs, and other adverse economic conditions that may be specific to the Internet, e-commerce, and payments industries. These changes may negatively affect sales of products and increase exposure to losses from bad debt and commodity prices, the cost and availability of financing, and costs associated with manufacturing and distributing products. Any economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.32Foreign currency risk may negatively affect our revenues, cost of sales, and operating margins, and could result in foreign exchange losses. We conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most countries in which we operate. We incur currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a different currency from the currency in which it operates, or holds assets or liabilities in a currency different from its functional currency. Changes in exchange rates can also affect our results of operations when the value of sales and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars. We cannot accurately predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations. Further, given the volatility of exchange rates, we may not be able to effectively manage our currency risks, and any volatility in currency exchange rates may increase the price of our products in local currency to our foreign customers or increase the manufacturing cost of our products, either of which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows, and profitability. We may incur losses related to foreign currency fluctuations, and foreign exchange controls may prevent us from repatriating cash in countries outside the U.S. Inflation and increased borrowing costs could impact our cash flows and profitability.Prolonged periods of inflation have the potential to adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity by increasing our overall cost structure, particularly if we are unable to achieve commensurate increases in the prices we charge our customers. The existence of inflation in the economy has and may continue to result in higher interest rates and capital costs, supply shortages, increased costs of labor and other similar effects. Further, world events such as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine could affect inflationary trends. As a result of inflation, we have experienced and may continue to experience, increases in our costs associated with operating our business including labor, equipment and other inputs. Additionally, our borrowing costs, including those under our current credit agreement, dated as of July 1, 2022, by and among us, the lenders and other parties thereto, and JP Morgan Chase Bank, NA, as administrative agent and collateral agent (the “Credit Agreement”), increase or decrease (i.e., “float”) based on interest rate benchmarks. As governments increase interest rate benchmarks to combat inflation, our borrowing costs increase. Although we may take measures to mitigate the impact of this inflation through pricing actions, efficiency gains and interest rate hedging, if these measures are not effective our business, results of operations, financial position and liquidity could be materially adversely affected. Even if such measures are effective, there could be a difference between the timing of when these beneficial actions impact our results of operations and when the cost of inflation is incurred.Our current credit agreement and any other credit or similar agreements into which we may enter in the future may restrict our operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions regarding our business.Our Credit Agreement contains a number of restrictive covenants that may impose operating and financial restrictions on us and limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interest, including restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness, grant liens, undergo certain fundamental changes, fund non-US operations, dispose of assets, make certain investments, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, and make certain restricted payments, in each case subject to limitations and exceptions set forth in the Credit Agreement.The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default that include, among other things, certain payment defaults, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to other indebtedness, change of control defaults, judgment defaults, and bankruptcy and insolvency defaults. Such events of default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, and financial results. Furthermore, if we are unable to repay the amounts due and payable under the Credit Agreement, those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness, which could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation. In the event that our lenders accelerated the repayment of the borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. Any acceleration of amounts due under the Credit Agreement would likely have a material adverse effect on us. As a result of these restrictions, we may be limited in how we conduct business, unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns, or unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.In addition, we may enter into other credit agreements or other debt arrangements from time to time which contain similar or more extensive restrictive covenants and events of default, in which case we may face similar or additional limitations as a result of the terms of those credit agreements or other debt arrangements.33Any inability to access financial markets from time to time to raise required capital, finance our working capital requirements or our acquisition strategies, or otherwise support our liquidity needs could negatively impact our ability to finance our operations, meet certain obligations, or implement our growth strategy. We from time to time borrow under our existing credit facility or use proceeds from sales of our securities to fund portions of our operations, including working capital investments and financing of our acquisition strategies. In the past, market disruptions experienced in the United States and abroad have materially impacted liquidity in the credit and debt markets, making financing terms for borrowers less attractive and, in certain cases, have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of financing. Uncertainty in the financial markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing or to refinance our existing debt arrangements on favorable terms or at all, which could negatively affect our ability to fund current and future expansion as well as future acquisitions and development. These disruptions may include turmoil in the financial services industry, volatility in the markets where our outstanding securities trade, and changes in general economic conditions in the areas where we do business. If we are unable to access funds at competitive rates, or if our short-term or long-term borrowing costs increase, our ability to finance our operations, meet our short-term obligations, and implement our operating strategies could be adversely affected.In the future, we may be required to raise additional capital through public or private financing or other arrangements. Such financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all, and our failure to raise capital when needed could harm our business and prospects. Additional equity financing may be dilutive to the holders of our outstanding capital stock, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to undertake certain activities that we otherwise would find to be desirable. Further, debt service obligations associated with any debt financing could reduce our profitability. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to grow our business or respond to competitive pressures.There are limitations on the protection of our intellectual property, and we may from time to time be involved in costly intellectual property litigation or indemnification. We rely on a combination of trade secret, patent, copyright, and trademark laws, combined with employee confidentiality, noncompetition, and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. We cannot ensure that our employees with key knowledge will not be employed by our competitors. There can be no assurance that the steps we take will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or intellectual property. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future. Asserting our intellectual property rights or defending against third-party claims could involve substantial expense. In the event that a third party were successful in a claim that one of our processes infringed its proprietary rights, we could be required to pay substantial damages or royalties, or spend substantial amounts in order to obtain a license or modify processes so that they no longer infringe such proprietary rights. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.The design, processes, and specialized equipment utilized in our engineered materials, advanced components, and subsystems are innovative, complex, and difficult to duplicate. However, there can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent similar technology, or that all aspects of our proprietary technology will be protected. Others have obtained patents covering a variety of materials, devices, equipment, configurations, and processes, and others could obtain patents covering technology similar to ours. We may be required to obtain licenses under such patents, and there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain such licenses, if required, on commercially reasonable terms, or that claims regarding rights to technology will not be asserted that may adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, our research and development contracts with agencies of the U.S. government present a risk that project-specific technology could be disclosed to competitors as contract reporting requirements are fulfilled. We also enter into development projects from time to time that might result in intellectual property developed during a project that is assigned to the other party without us retaining rights to that intellectual property or is jointly owned with the other party.Our global operations are subject to complex and rapidly changing legal and regulatory requirements. We manufacture products in numerous countries worldwide. Operations inside and outside of the United States are subject to many legal and regulatory requirements, some of which are not aligned with others. These include tariffs, quotas, taxes and other market barriers, restrictions on the export or import of technology, potentially limited intellectual property protection, import and export requirements and restrictions, anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, foreign investment rules and regulations, data privacy requirements, competition laws, employment and labor laws, pensions and social insurance, and environmental health and safety laws and regulations. 34Compliance with these laws and regulations can be onerous and expensive, and requirements differ among jurisdictions. New laws, changes in existing laws, and abrogation of local regulations by national laws may result in significant uncertainties in how they will be interpreted and enforced. Failure to comply with any of these foreign laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.We may face particular data privacy and security and data protection risks due to laws and regulations regulating the protection or security of personal and other sensitive data.We may face particular data privacy, security and data protection risks due to laws and regulations regulating the protection or security of personal and other sensitive data, including in particular several laws and regulations that have recently been enacted or adopted or are likely to be enacted or adopted in the future. For instance, effective May 25, 2018, the European General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) imposed additional obligations and risk upon our business and increased substantially the penalties to which we could be subject in the event of any non-compliance. GDPR requires companies to satisfy requirements regarding the handling of personal data (generally, of EU residents), including its use, protection and the rights of affected persons regarding their data. Failure to comply with GDPR requirements could result in fines of up to 20 million Euro or 4% of global annual revenues, whichever is higher. We have taken extensive measures to ensure compliance with GDPR and to minimize the risk of incurring any penalties and we continue to adapt to the developing interpretation and enforcement of GDPR as well as emerging best practice standards. For example, we have established a privacy program office that oversees global compliance of privacy laws (including GDPR), introduced a Data Protection Policy, implemented a security system for data protection management and updated our international Intra Group Data Transfer Agreement to include the new EU Standard Contractual Clauses. In addition, several other jurisdictions around the world have recently enacted privacy laws or regulations similar to GDPR. For instance, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which became effective January 1, 2020, and gives consumers and employees many of the same rights as those available under GDPR. Similar laws to the CCPA have been enacted in the United States at both the federal and state level. Compliance with global privacy and security laws and regulations, as well as any associated inquiries or investigations or any other government actions, may be costly to comply with, result in negative publicity, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, and subject us to remedies that may harm our business.As and additional example, there have also been recent developments concerning privacy and data security in China, where we have significant operations. For example, the Data Security Law of the People’s Republic of China (the “Data Security Law”) took effect in September 2021. The Data Security Law imposes data security and privacy obligations on entities and individuals carrying out data processing activities and also introduces a data classification and hierarchical protection system based on the importance of data in economic and social development and the degree of harm it may cause to national security, public interests, or legitimate rights and interests of individuals or organizations if such data are tampered with, destroyed, leaked, illegally acquired, or illegally used. The appropriate level of protection measures is required to be taken for each respective category of data. Further, the Personal Information Protection Law (the “PIPL”) took effect in China in November 2021. The PIPL raises the protection requirements for processing personal information and requires government approval to conduct personal data transfers outside of China. We have submitted our application with Cyberspace Administration of China and are awaiting approval. Because many specific requirements of the PIPL remain to be clarified, the ultimate impact of the PIPL currently is unknown. Fines for PIPL violations range from $7.7M to up to 5% of the infringing company’s previous year’s revenues. We may be required to make adjustments to our business practices to comply with the personal information protection laws and regulations in China as they evolve.Data breach incidents and breakdowns of information and communication technologies could disrupt our operations, subject us to legal claims, and impact our financial results.In the course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property (both our own and that of our customers), as well as proprietary business information. We also maintain personal and confidential data regarding our employees. We could be subject to service outages or breaches of security systems which may result in disruption, unauthorized access, misappropriation, or corruption of this information. Security breaches of our network or data, including physical or electronic break-ins, vendor service outages, computer viruses, attacks by hackers or similar breaches can create system disruptions, shutdowns, and unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. If we are unable to prevent or contain such security or privacy breaches, our operations could be disrupted or we could suffer legal claims, loss of reputation, financial loss, property damage, or regulatory penalties.35We use and generate potentially hazardous substances that are subject to stringent environmental and safety regulations. Hazardous substances used or generated in some of our research and manufacturing facilities are subject to stringent environmental and safety regulations. We believe that our handling of such substances is in material compliance with applicable environmental, safety, and health regulations at each operating location. We invest substantially in facility and infrastructure design, proper personal protective equipment and process controls, including specialized monitoring equipment and training, to minimize risks to our facilities, employees, surrounding communities, and the environment that could result from the presence and handling of such hazardous substances. When exposure problems or potential exposure problems have been uncovered, corrective actions have been implemented, and re-occurrence has been minimal or nonexistent. We have in place emergency response plans with respect to our generation and use of the hazardous gases, which include hydrogen selenide, hydrogen sulfide, arsine, phosphine, and silane. Special attention has been given to all procedures pertaining to these gaseous materials to minimize the chance of accidental release into the atmosphere and to provide for an integrated system for monitoring and mitigating risk. With respect to the manufacturing, use, storage, and disposal of the low-level radioactive material thorium fluoride, our facilities and procedures have been inspected and licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Thorium-bearing by-products are collected and shipped as solid waste to a government-approved low-level radioactive waste disposal site in Clive, Utah. The generation, use, collection, storage, and disposal of all other hazardous by-products, such as suspended solids containing heavy metals or airborne particulates, are believed by us to be in material compliance with regulations. We believe that we have obtained all of the permits and licenses required for operation of our business.From time to time new regulations are enacted, and it is difficult to anticipate how such regulations will be implemented and enforced. We continue to evaluate the necessary steps for compliance with regulations as they are enacted. The implementation of such regulations may require us to incur additional costs and expend internal resources. Although we do not know of any material environmental, safety, or health problems in our properties, processes, or products, there can be no assurance that problems will not develop in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.We have a substantial amount of debt, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations and prevent us from fulfilling our debt-related obligations.As of June 30, 2023, we had approximately $4.3 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis, including under (i) our $850 million senior secured term loan A facility (the “Term A Facility”), (ii) our $2.8 billion senior secured term loan B facility (the “Term Loan B Facility”, and together with the Term A Facility, the “Senior Credit Facilities”) and (iii) our $990 million 5.000% senior notes due 2029 (the “2029 Notes”). Additionally we have $348 million of undrawn capacity under our senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”). We may also incur additional indebtedness in the future by entering into new financing arrangements. Our indebtedness could have important consequences for us, including:•making it difficult for us to satisfy all of our obligations with respect to our debt, or to our trade or other creditors;•increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions;•limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions, particularly when the availability of financing in the capital markets is limited;•requiring us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing or on our variable-rate indebtedness if interest rates rise;•requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations and the proceeds of any capital markets offerings or loan borrowings for the payment of interest on our debt and reducing our ability to use our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and general corporate requirements;•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate; and•placing us at a competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors. 36We may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, together with any future borrowings, to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, on or before its maturity. We may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, we may incur additional indebtedness in order to finance our operations, fund acquisitions, or repay existing indebtedness. If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, pursuing sales of additional debt or equity securities, or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments, or alliances. Any such actions, if necessary, may not be able to be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or on terms that would be advantageous to our stockholders, or on terms that would not require us to breach the terms and conditions of our existing or future debt agreements.The agreements that govern our senior credit facilities and our 5.000% senior notes due 2029 contain various covenants that impose restrictions on our business, which may affect our ability to operate our businesses.The Credit Agreement and the Indenture, dated as of December 10, 2021 (the “Indenture”), which provides for the 2029 Notes, contain various affirmative and negative covenants that will, subject to certain significant exceptions, restrict our ability to, among other things, have liens on our property, incur additional indebtedness, enter into sale and lease-back transactions, make loans, advances or other investments, make non-ordinary course asset sales, declare or pay dividends or make other distributions with respect to equity interests, and/or merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or convey certain of our assets to any one person, among other things. In addition, the Term Loan A Facility and Revolving Credit Facility require that the Company maintain (i) a maximum total net leverage ratio, as defined in the New Credit Agreement, initially of 5.25 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, commencing with the end of the first full fiscal quarter after the Closing Date, stepping down to 4.00 to 1.00 at December 31, 2023 and thereafter and (ii) an interest coverage ratio, as defined in the Credit Agreement, of at least 2.50 to 1.00. Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate our repayment obligations under the Credit Agreement or the Indenture, as applicable. If such indebtedness is accelerated, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources or that we will be able to arrange financing to repay our borrowings at such time. Unfavorable changes in tax rates, tax liabilities, or tax accounting rules could negatively affect future results.As a global company, we are subject to taxation in the United States and various other countries and jurisdictions. As such, we must exercise a level of judgment in determining our worldwide tax liabilities. Our future tax rates could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in countries with differing tax rates or changes in tax laws as well as changes in our current or future global corporate structure, including our integration of existing and acquired legal entities. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significantly adverse impact on our effective tax rate, including the “Inflation Reduction Act of 2022” and the two-pillar solution for a global minimum level of taxation by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”). We are also impacted by the establishment or release of valuation allowances against deferred tax assets, changes in generally accepted accounting principles and continued eligibility for tax holiday benefits.The enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) in December 2017 significantly affected U.S. tax law by changing how the United States imposes tax on multinational corporations. The U.S. Department of Treasury has broad authority under the Tax Act to issue regulations and interpretive guidance. We have applied available guidance to estimate our tax obligations, but new guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department may cause us to make adjustments to our tax estimates in future periods. In addition, we are subject to regular examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. This includes challenges to our intercompany transfer pricing arrangements and charges and the appropriate level of profitability for our entities. We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations and Competent Authority processes to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provision and accruals, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operation, or financial condition.37Natural disasters or other global or regional catastrophic events could disrupt our operations, give rise to substantial environmental hazards, and adversely affect our results. We may be exposed to business interruptions due to extreme weather caused by climate change and deforestation, force majeure catastrophes, natural disasters, (including, but not limited to, droughts; earthquakes; flooding; heavy rains; landslides; rotating storms like cyclones, hurricanes, tornados, and typhoons; tsunamis and other giant waves; wildfires and volcanic eruptions), pandemic, terrorism, or acts of war that are beyond our control. Disruptions to our facilities or systems, or to those of our key suppliers, could also interrupt operational processes and adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products and provide services and support to our customers. As a result, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.A portion of our research and development activities, manufacturing, and other critical business operations are located near major earthquake faults, for example in Santa Clara, California, an area with a history of seismic events. . Other business operations are located in regions which could be effected by any future increases in sea levels or in the frequency or severity of heavy rains, rotating and other storms, tsunamis and other giant waves, landslides and flooding including, but not limited to, China, Korea, Vietnam, and the coastal regions of the United States including, but not limited to, California and Florida. Any such loss or detrimental impact to any of our operations, logistics or facilities could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenues and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility. While we have obtained insurance to cover most potential losses, after reviewing the costs and limitations associated with earthquake insurance, we have decided not to procure such insurance. We believe that this decision is consistent with decisions reached by numerous other companies located nearby. We cannot ensure you that our existing insurance coverage will be adequate against all other possible losses.Delays in transportation of products and possible shortages of critical raw materials, parts, equipment and other resources may adversely affect our results of operations.Current challenges in global shipping and other aspects of commercial transportation, such as congestion in ports, a shortage in containers and a general lack of space on ships and trucks, have adversely impacted our operations. Because of this ongoing situation, we face a risk of continued supply chain disruptions. Additionally, our revenues and collections also may be adversely affected by transportation delays that could have a negative impact on the timing of payments that we receive under our sales arrangements. If these issues continue beyond the short term, our overall supply chain and our revenues derived from our sales flow could be adversely impacted.Our success requires us to attract, retain, and develop key personnel and maintain good relations with our employees.We are highly dependent upon the experience and continuing services of certain scientists, engineers, production, sales, and management personnel. Competition for the services of these personnel is intense. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain or attract the personnel necessary for our success. The loss of the services of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. Our failure to execute on our succession planning may affect our ability to maintain our differentiated knowledge base. We contract with a number of large end-user service providers and product companies that have considerable bargaining power, which may require us to agree to terms and conditions that could have an adverse effect on our business or ability to recognize revenues. Large end-user service providers and product companies comprise a significant portion of our customer base. These large customers generally have greater purchasing power than smaller customers and, accordingly, often negotiate more favorable terms from suppliers, including us. As we seek to expand our sales to existing and new large customers, we may be required to agree to terms and conditions that are more favorable to these customers and that may affect the timing of our ability to recognize revenue, increase our costs, and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, large customers have increased buying power and ability to negotiate onerous terms into our contracts with them, including pricing, warranties, indemnification and production capability terms. If we are unable to satisfy the terms of these contracts, it could result in liabilities of a material nature, including litigation, damages, additional costs, loss of market share, and loss of reputation. Additionally, the terms these large customers require, such as most-favored customer or exclusivity provisions, may impact our ability to do business with other customers and generate revenues from such customers. The adoption of new climate change regulations may result in increased financial costs and/or losses.In many of the countries in which we operate, government bodies are increasingly enacting legislation and regulations in response to potential impacts of climate change. These laws and regulations have the potential to impact our operations directly or indirectly as a result of required compliance by our customers and/or suppliers. Inconsistency of regulations may also affect the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations. Assessments of the potential impact of future climate change legislation, regulation, and international treaties and accords are uncertain, given the wide scope of potential regulatory change in countries in which we operate. 38We may incur increased capital expenditures resulting from required compliance with revised or new legislation or regulations, added costs to purchase raw materials, lower profits from sales of our products, allowances or credits under a “cap and trade” system, increased insurance premiums and deductibles as new actuarial tables are developed to reshape coverage, changes in competitive position relative to industry peers, changes to profit or loss arising from increased or decreased demand for goods produced by us, or changes in costs of goods sold.Some of our business units depend from time to time on large purchases from a few large customers, and any loss, cancellation, reduction, or delay in purchases by these large customers could harm the longevity of the business.A small number of customers have consistently accounted for a significant portion of our revenues, with one customer contributing more than 10% of total revenues in fiscal 2023. Our success will depend on our continued ability to develop and manage relationships with our large customers and their continued need for our products. Although we are attempting to expand our customer base, we expect that significant customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future. We may not be able to offset any decline in revenues from our existing large customers with revenues from new customers, and our quarterly results may be volatile because we are dependent on large orders from these customers that may be reduced, delayed, or cancelled. The markets in which we have historically sold our optical subsystems and components products are dominated by a relatively small number of systems manufacturers, thereby limiting the number of our potential customers. Our dependence on large orders from a relatively small number of large customers makes our relationship with each large customer critically important to our business. We cannot ensure that we will be able to retain our large customers, attract additional large customers, or that our large customers will be successful in selling their products that incorporate our products. In addition, governmental trade action or economic sanctions may limit or preclude our ability to do business with certain large customers. We have in the past experienced delays and reductions in orders from some of our large customers. In addition, our large customers have in the past sought price concessions from us, and we expect that they will continue to do so in the future. Cost and expense reduction measures that we have implemented over the past several years, and additional action we are taking to reduce costs, may adversely affect our ability to introduce new and improved products, which may, in turn, adversely affect our relationships with some of our large customers. Further, some of our large customers may in the future shift their purchases of products from us to our competitors or to joint ventures between these customers and our competitors, or may in certain circumstances produce competitive products themselves. The loss of one or more of our large customers, any reduction or delay in sales to these customers, our inability to successfully develop relationships with additional customers, or future price concessions that we may make could significantly harm our business. Actions that we are taking to restructure our business in alignment with our strategic priorities may not be as effective as anticipated.In May 2023, we announced that our Board of Directors approved a restructuring plan (the “Restructuring Plan”) which includes site consolidations, facilities movements and closures, and the relocation and requalification of certain manufacturing facilities. While the Restructuring Plan and other proactive cost reduction measures that we plan to take are intended to realign our cost structure as part of a transformation to a simpler, more streamlined, resilient and sustainable business model, we may encounter challenges in the execution of these efforts that could prevent us from recognizing the intended benefits of such efforts.As a result of the Restructuring Plan, we expect to incur approximately $150 million to $200 million of pre-tax charges in the fiscal years 2023 to 2025 primarily as a result of the reduction in force and facility consolidations related to the closure and relocation of sites. We also have incurred, and may continue to incur, additional costs in the near term, including cash payments related to severance, employee benefits and employee transition costs, as well as non-cash charges for share-based compensation expense. The Restructuring Plan may result in other unintended consequences, including higher than anticipated costs in implementing planned workforce reductions, particularly in highly regulated locations outside the United States; higher than anticipated lease termination and facility closure costs; employee attrition beyond our intended reduction in force; and decreased employee morale among our remaining employees; diversion of management attention; adverse effects to our reputation as an employer which could make it more difficult for us to hire new employees in the future; loss of the institutional knowledge and expertise of departing employees; failure to maintain adequate controls and procedures while executing, and subsequent to completing, the Restructuring Plan; and potential failure or delays to meet operational and growth targets due to the loss of qualified employees. If we experience any of these adverse consequences, the Restructuring Plan and other cost reduction initiatives that we may undertake may not achieve or sustain the intended benefits. Our failure to achieve the expected results from the Restructuring Plan and other cost reduction initiatives for any reason also could lead to the implementation of additional restructuring-related activities in the future, which may exacerbate these risks or introduce new risks which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.39We have announced that we are reviewing strategic alternatives for our silicon carbide business, but there can be no assurance that a strategic transaction will be completed or that we will achieve the expected benefits of any strategic transaction that we determine to pursue.In May 2023, we announced that we are reviewing strategic alternatives for our silicon carbide business. The process of evaluating strategic alternatives and completing any transaction may be time-consuming and involve considerable costs and expenses, which could be higher than what we anticipate. Moreover, we may not be able to complete any strategic transaction on the anticipated terms or time frame or at all, and any strategic transactions may not generate some or all of the anticipated strategic, financial, operational or other benefits. Whether or not a transaction is ultimately completed, the review of strategic alternatives and the pendency of any transaction could adversely impact Coherent and our business (including our silicon carbide business), including through potential business disruption, diversion of management time and attention and reduced employee retention, and potential impacts on Coherent’s relationships with its customers and other stakeholders.Our operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to manufacture certain products in our manufacturing facilities. We manufacture some of the components that we incorporate into our subsystem products; in other cases, we provide components to contract manufacturers to produce finished or intermediary goods. For some of the components and finished or intermediary goods, we are the sole qualified manufacturer. Our manufacturing processes are highly complex, and quality issues are often difficult to forecast, detect, and correct. From time to time we have experienced problems achieving acceptable yields in our manufacturing facilities, resulting in delays in the availability of our products. In addition, if we experience problems with our manufacturing facilities, it would be costly and require a long period of time to move the manufacture of these components and finished good products to a different facility or contract manufacturer, which could result in interruptions in supply and would likely materially impact our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, for a variety of reasons, including changes in circumstances at our contract manufacturers or our own business strategies, we may voluntarily, or be required to, transfer the manufacturing of certain products to other manufacturing sites. Changes in manufacturing processes are often required due to changes in product specifications, yield improvements, changing customer needs, and the introduction of new products. These changes may reduce manufacturing yields at our contract manufacturers and at our own manufacturing facilities, resulting in reduced margins on and/or reduced availability of those products. Also, our ability to control the quality of products produced by contract manufacturers may be limited and quality issues may not be resolved in a timely manner, which could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations. In addition, many of our products are sourced from suppliers based outside of the United States, primarily in Asia. Uncertainty with respect to tax and trade policies, tariffs, and government regulations affecting trade between the United States and other countries has recently increased. Major developments in tax policy or trade relations, such as the imposition of tariffs on imported products, could increase our product and product-related costs or require us to seek alternative suppliers, either of which could result in decreased sales or increased product and product-related costs. Failure to accurately forecast our customer demands and our resulting revenues could result in additional charges for obsolete or excess inventories or noncancellable purchase commitments. We base many of our operating decisions including, but not limited to, those regarding manufacturing capacity and staffing, and enter into purchase commitments, on the basis of anticipated revenue trends that are highly unpredictable. Some of our purchase commitments are not cancellable, and in some cases we are required to recognize a charge representing an amount of material or capital equipment purchased or ordered that exceeds our actual requirements. Should revenues in future periods fall substantially below our expectations, or should we fail to accurately forecast changes in demand mix, we could be required to record substantial charges for obsolete or excess inventories or noncancellable purchase commitments.Our markets are unpredictable and characterized by rapid technological changes and evolving standards demanding a significant investment in research and development, and, if we fail to address changing market conditions, our business and operating results will be harmed.Our markets are characterized by extensive research and development, rapid technological change, frequent new product introductions, changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards. Because this industry is subject to rapid change, it is difficult to predict its potential size or future growth rate. Our success in generating sales in this industry will depend on, among other things:•maintaining and enhancing our relationships with our customers;•the education of potential end-user customers about the benefits of lasers and laser systems; and•our ability to accurately predict and develop our products to meet industry standards.40We cannot ensure you that our expenditures for research and development will result in the launch of new products or, if such products are introduced, that those products will achieve sufficient market acceptance or to generate sales to offset the costs of development. Our failure to address rapid technological changes in our markets could adversely affect our business and results of operations.If our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered in determining whether a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets may not be recoverable include declines in our stock price and market capitalization or future cash flows projections. A decline in our stock price, or any other adverse change in market conditions, particularly if such change has the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we used to calculate the estimated fair value of our reporting units, could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in an impairment charge. Any such material charges, whether related to goodwill or purchased intangible assets, may have a material negative impact on our financial and operating results.If we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired. As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (“the Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), and New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) listing requirements. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources, including accounting-related costs and significant management oversight. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement, could delay the reporting of our financial results or cause us to be subject to investigations, enforcement actions by regulatory agencies, stockholder lawsuits, or other adverse actions requiring us to incur defense costs or pay fines, settlements, or judgments. Any such failures or difficulties could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. We may also then become the target of activist investors. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the NYSE. Risks Relating to Our Capital StockThe trading prices for our common stock have been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future.The trading prices for our common stock varied between a high of $60.46 per share and a low of $26.29 per share in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. The market prices of our securities could fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including the following:•future announcements by or concerning us or our competitors;•the overall performance of equity markets;•the trading volume of our securities;•additions or changes to our Board of Directors, management, or key personnel;•regulatory actions (including, but not limited to, developments in international trade policy) and enforcement actions bearing on manufacturing, development, marketing, or sales;•the commencement or outcome of litigation;•reports and recommendations of analysts and whether or not we meet the milestones, metrics, and other expectations set forth in such reports;•gaining or losing large customers;•the introduction of new products or services and market acceptance of such products or services;•fluctuations in demand for our products or downturns in the industries that we serve, particularly the continued build-out of the capacity for the manufacture of OLED and the increased use of the installed base of our products in such manufacturing;•the impact of any public health crisis on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects or those of our customers and suppliers;•the acquisition or loss of significant manufacturers, distributors, or suppliers or an inability to obtain sufficient quantities of materials needed to provide our services;•the issuance of common stock or other securities (including shares of common stock issued upon conversion of any shares of Series B Preferred Stock);41•incurrence of indebtedness;•quarterly variations in operating results;•our ability to accurately forecast future performance;•business acquisitions or divestitures;•fluctuations in the economy, political events, or general market conditions; and•changes in our operating industry generally.In addition, stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years. Moreover, these fluctuations frequently have been unrelated to the operating performance or underlying fundamentals of the affected companies. These broad market fluctuations, including fluctuations within our industry peer group, may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. These fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance or out of our control, and could lead to securities class action litigation that could result in substantial expenses and diversion of management’s attention and corporate resources, any or all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Provisions in our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws and the Pennsylvania Associations Code (the “Code”) may delay or prevent our acquisition by a third party, which could also reduce the market price of our capital stock. Our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws contain provisions that could make us a less attractive target for a hostile takeover and could make more difficult or discourage a merger proposal, a tender offer, or a proxy contest. Such provisions include:•a requirement that shareholder-nominated director nominees be nominated in advance of the meeting at which directors are elected and that specific information be provided in connection with such nomination;•the ability of our Board of Directors to issue additional shares of common stock or preferred stock without shareholder approval; and•certain provisions requiring supermajority approval (at least two-thirds of the votes cast by all shareholders entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class).In addition, the Code contains provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our control or changes in our management. Many of these provisions are triggered if any person or group acquires, or discloses the intent to acquire, 20% or more of a corporation’s voting power, subject to certain exceptions. These provisions:•provide the other shareholders of the corporation with certain rights against the acquiring group or person;•prohibit the corporation from engaging in a broad range of business combinations with the acquiring group or person;•restrict the voting and other rights of the acquiring group or person; and•provide that certain profits realized by the acquiring group or person from the sale of our equity securities belong to and are recoverable by us.Regardless of the amount of a person’s holdings, if a shareholder or shareholder group (including affiliated persons) would be a party to certain proposed transactions with us or would be treated differently from other shareholders of ours in certain proposed transactions, the Code requires approval by a majority of votes entitled to be cast by all shareholders other than the interested shareholder or affiliate group, unless the transaction is approved by independent directors or other criteria are satisfied. Furthermore, under the Code, a “short-form” merger of Coherent Corp. cannot be implemented without the consent of our Board of Directors.In addition, as permitted by Pennsylvania law, an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation or other corporate action that is approved by shareholders may provide mandatory special treatment for specified groups of nonconsenting shareholders of the same class. For example, an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation or other corporate action may provide that shares of common stock held by designated shareholders of record must be cashed out at a price determined by the Company, subject to applicable dissenters’ rights.Furthermore, the Code provides that directors, in discharging their duties, may consider, to the extent they deem appropriate, the effects of any action upon shareholders, employees, suppliers, customers, and the communities in which the corporation’s offices are located. Directors are not required to consider the interests of shareholders to a greater degree than other constituencies’ interests. The Code expressly provides that directors do not violate their fiduciary duties solely by relying on “poison pills” or the anti-takeover provisions of the Code. We do not currently have a “poison pill.”All of these provisions may limit the price that investors may be willing to pay for shares of our capital stock.In addition, if any of certain fundamental changes were to occur, we or the surviving entity would be required to make an offer to repurchase, at the option and election of the holders thereof, for cash each share of Series B Preferred Stock then outstanding. These features of the Series B Preferred Stock could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management.42We do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock; holders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value and by the intended anti-dilution actions of our share-buyback program.We have never declared nor paid dividends on our common stock and do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings to support operations and to finance the development of our business. As a result, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon future appreciation in its value. There is no guarantee that our common stock will maintain its value or appreciate in value.Our ability to declare and pay dividends on our capital stock may be limited, including by the terms of our existing Credit Agreement.Our declaration and payment of dividends on our capital stock in the future will be determined by our Board of Directors (or an authorized committee thereof) in its sole discretion and will depend on our financial condition, earnings, growth prospects, other uses of cash, funding requirements, applicable Pennsylvania law, and other factors our Board of Directors deems relevant.The terms of the Credit Agreement contain a restriction on our ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock. Credit facilities, indentures, or other financing agreements that we enter into in the future also may contain provisions that restrict or prohibit our ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock.In addition, under Pennsylvania law, our Board of Directors may not pay dividends if after giving effect to the relevant dividend payment we (i) would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of our business or (ii) our total assets would not be greater than or equal to the sum of our total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed if we were to be dissolved at the time as of which the dividend is measured, in order to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of shareholders whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the dividend. Our common stock is subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness; the Series B Preferred Stock; and any other preferred stock we may issue in the future. Our Series B Preferred Stock ranks junior to all of our and our subsidiaries’ consolidated liabilities.Shares of our common stock are equity interests that rank junior to all indebtedness and other non-equity claims on us with respect to assets available to satisfy our claims, including in a liquidation of the Company. Additionally, holders of our common stock may be subject to prior dividend and liquidation rights of any holders of our preferred stock or depositary shares representing such preferred stock then outstanding.Our common stock ranks junior to our Series B Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends and amounts payable in the event of our liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of our affairs. This means that, unless accumulated dividends have been paid on all the Series B Preferred Stock then outstanding through the most recently completed dividend period, no dividends may be declared or paid on our common stock and we will not be permitted to repurchase any of our common stock, subject to limited exceptions. Likewise, in the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of our affairs, no distribution of our assets may be made to holders of our common stock until we have paid to holders of the Series B Preferred Stock then outstanding the applicable liquidation preferences.In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of our affairs, our assets will be available to pay obligations on the Series B Preferred Stock only after all of our consolidated liabilities have been paid. In addition, the Series B Preferred Stock ranks structurally junior to all existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of our affairs, there may not be sufficient assets remaining, after paying our and our subsidiaries’ liabilities, to pay amounts due on any or all of the Series B Preferred Stock then outstanding.Our Board of Directors can issue, without approval of the holders of our common stock, preferred stock with voting and conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock, the rights of holders of shares of our capital stock, or the market price of our capital stock.Our Articles of Incorporation authorize our Board of Directors to issue one or more additional series of preferred stock and set the terms of the preferred stock without seeking any further approval from our shareholders. Any preferred stock that is issued will rank ahead of our common stock in terms of dividends and liquidation rights. If we issue additional preferred stock, it may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Our Board of Directors also has the authority, without shareholder approval, subject to applicable law, to set the terms of any such series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights, preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends, and other terms, or upon our liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of our affairs. If we issue additional preferred stock in the future that has a preference over our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of our affairs, or if we issue additional preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock, the rights of holders of our capital stock or the market price of our capital stock could be adversely affected. The issuance of preferred stock or even the ability to issue preferred stock could also have the effect of delaying, deterring, or preventing a change of control or other corporate action.43The redemption rights of the holders of Series B Preferred Stock may result in the use of our cash in such a way that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.At any time on or after the ten-year anniversary of the applicable issuance date of the shares of our Series B Preferred Stock and subject to the procedures set forth in the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock, each holder of such shares will have the right to require us to redeem all of such holder’s shares for cash at a price per share equal to the sum of the applicable stated value for such shares plus accrued or declared and unpaid dividends on such shares that had not previously been added to such stated value. This may have the effect of reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, thereby negatively affecting the interests of holders of our other capital stock, including our common stock. Holders of our Series B Preferred Stock can exercise significant control over us, which could limit the ability of holders of our other capital stock to influence the outcome of key transactions, including a change of control. Our Series B Preferred Stock has voting rights, allowing holders to vote as one class with our common stock on an as-converted basis, subject to limited exceptions. As a result, the holders of Series B Preferred Stock have the ability to significantly influence the outcome of any matter submitted for the vote of the holders of our common stock. Holders of Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to act separately in their own respective interests with respect to their ownership interests in us and have the ability to substantially influence all matters that require approval by our shareholders, including the approval of significant corporate transactions. Additionally, we may not undertake certain actions without the prior written approval of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock, voting separately from our common stock. Subject to certain exceptions, we must not: (1) alter or change the rights, preferences or privileges of our Series B Preferred Stock or amend, modify or supplement any provision of our organizational documents in a manner that adversely affects the rights, powers, preferences or privileges of our Series B Preferred Stock; (2) authorize or issue any senior stock (or securities convertible into senior stock), or amend or alter our articles of incorporation to increase the number of authorized or issued shares of our Series B Preferred Stock; (3) decrease the number of authorized shares of our Series B Preferred Stock (other than as permitted pursuant to a conversion, redemption or repurchase by us thereof); (4) issue any shares of our Series B Preferred Stock (other than pursuant to the amended and restated invested agreement, entered into on March 30, 2021, by and between Bain Capital Private Equity, LP (“BCPE”) and us (the “Investment Agreement”); and (5) effect any voluntary deregistration or delisting with the NYSE of our common stock. Furthermore, we may not, unless holders of Series B Preferred Stock otherwise consent in writing (or if such action is taken with respect to a Permitted Issuance (as defined in the Investment Agreement)), so long as BCPE owns at least 5% of the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock that it held immediately following the issuance and sale of the Series B-2 Preferred Stock upon completion of our acquisition of Coherent, Inc., (i) authorize or issue any parity stock and (ii) pay any cash dividend on our common stock (other than ordinary dividends). We also may not, unless BCPE otherwise consents in writing (or if such action is taken with respect to a Permitted Issuance (as defined in the Investment Agreement)), so long as it owns at least 25% of the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock that it held immediately following the issuance and sale of the Series B-2 Preferred Stock upon completion of our acquisition of Coherent, Inc., redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire (or make or declare any dividend or distribution in respect of) any junior stock (subject to certain exceptions, including, among other things, ordinary dividends, non-cash dividends or other distributions paid pro rata to all holders of our common stock and, if applicable, holders of Series B Preferred Stock, repurchases of junior stock of up to $100 million on an aggregate annual basis and dividends on junior stock in kind or in the form of other junior securities or securities convertible into or exchange for such junior securities). Moreover, under the terms of the Investment Agreement, following the closing of the initial investment and for so long as BCPE beneficially owns shares of Series B Preferred Stock (or shares of our common stock issued upon the conversion thereof) that represent, in the aggregate and on an as-converted basis, at least 25% of the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock that it held immediately following the completion of the issuance and sale of the Series B-2 Preferred Stock upon completion of our acquisition of Coherent, BCPE will have the right to nominate one designee and to designate one observer to the our Board of Directors. Circumstances may occur in which the interests of BCPE could conflict with the interests of holders of other outstanding capital stock, including our common stock.Reports published by securities or industry analysts, freelance bloggers and credit rating agencies, including projections in those reports that exceed our actual results, could adversely affect our share price and trading volume.Research analysts and freelance bloggers publish their own quarterly projections regarding our operating results. These projections may vary widely from one another and may not accurately predict the results we actually achieve. Our share price may decline if we fail to meet securities research analysts’ projections. Similarly, if one or more of the analysts who cover us change their recommendations regarding our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our share price could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, our share price or trading volume could decline.44We depend on our subsidiaries for cash to fund our operations and expenses, including future dividend payments with respect to our outstanding preferred stock.A significant portion of our operations is conducted through our subsidiaries, and our ability to generate cash to meet our debt service obligations or to make future dividend payments, to the extent we elect to make such payments in cash, with respect to our Series B Preferred Stock is highly dependent on the earnings and the receipt of funds from our subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries are separate legal entities that have no obligation to make any funds available to us, whether by dividends, loans, or other payments.45"
9,COHR,COHERENT INC,2022-08-29,"RISK FACTORSThe following are certain risk factors that could affect our business, results of operations, financial position or cash flows. These risk factors should be considered along with the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, because these factors could cause our actual results or financial condition to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. The following discussion is not an all-inclusive listing of risks, although we believe these are the material risks that we face. If any of the following occur, our business, results of operations, financial position, or cash flows could be adversely affected. You should carefully consider these factors, as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, when evaluating an investment in our securities. Risks Relating to Our Business and Our IndustryInvestments in future markets of potential significant growth may not result in the expected return.  We continue to make investments in programs with the goal of gaining a greater share of end markets using semiconductor lasers and other components, including those used for 3D sensing, power electronics and emerging 5G technology. We cannot guarantee that our investments in capital and capabilities will be sufficient. The potential end markets, as well as our ability to gain market share in such markets, may not materialize on the timeline anticipated or at all. We cannot be sure of the end market price, specification, or yield for products incorporating our technologies. Our technologies could fail to fulfill, partially or completely, our target customers’ specifications. We cannot guarantee the end market customers’ acceptance of our technologies. Further, we may be unable to fulfill the terms of our contracts with our target customers, which could result in penalties of a material nature, including damages, loss of market share, and loss of reputation.Our competitive position depends on our ability to develop new products and processes. To meet our strategic objectives, we must develop, manufacture, and market new products and continue to update our existing products and processes to keep pace with market developments to address increasingly sophisticated customer requirements. Our success in developing and selling new and enhanced products and processes depends upon a variety of factors, including strategic product selection, efficient completion of product design and development, timely implementation of manufacturing and assembly processes, effective sales and marketing, and high-quality and successful product performance in the market.The introduction by our competitors of products or processes using new developments that are better or faster than ours could render our products or processes obsolete or unmarketable. We intend to continue to make significant investments in research, development, and engineering to achieve our goals. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new products or enhancements to our existing products and processes in a manner which satisfies customer needs or achieves market acceptance. The failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business and maintain our competitive position and on our results of operations and/or financial condition.Our products may contain defects that are not detected until deployed, which could increase our costs, reduce our revenues, cause us to lose key customers, or expose us to litigation related to our products. Some systems that use our products are inherently complex in design and require ongoing maintenance. As a result of the technological complexity of our products, in particular our excimer laser annealing tools used in the flat panel display market, changes in our or our suppliers’ manufacturing processes or the inadvertent use of defective materials by us or our suppliers could result in a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields and product reliability. Our customers may also discover defects in our products after the products have been fully deployed and operated under peak stress conditions. In addition, some of our products are combined with products from other vendors which may contain defects. Should problems occur, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. If we are unable to correct defects or other problems, we could experience, among other things, loss of customers, increased costs of product returns and warranty expenses, damage to our brand reputation, failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance, diversion of development and engineering resources, or legal action by our customers. The occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.25Our competitive position may still require significant investments. We continuously monitor the marketplace for strategic opportunities, and our business strategy includes expanding our product lines and markets through both internal product development and acquisitions. Consequently, we expect to continue to consider strategic acquisition of businesses, products, or technologies complementary to our business. This may require significant investments of management time and financial resources. If market demand is outside our organic capabilities, if a strategic acquisition is required and we cannot identify one or execute on it, and/or if financial investments that we undertake distract management, do not result in the expected return on investment, expose us to unforeseen liabilities, or jeopardize our ability to comply with our credit facility covenants due to any inability to integrate the business, adjust to operating a larger and more complex organization, adapt to additional political and other requirements associated with the acquired business, retain staff, or work with customers, we could suffer a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.We may be unable to successfully implement our acquisitions strategy or integrate acquired companies and personnel with existing operations.  We have acquired several companies, including Finisar Corporation (“Finisar”) in September 2019 and Coherent in July 2022. We expect to expand and diversify our operations with additional acquisitions, but we may be unable to identify or complete prospective acquisitions for many reasons, including increasing competition from other potential acquirers, the effects of consolidation in our industries, and potentially high valuations of acquisition candidates. In addition, applicable antitrust laws and other regulations may limit our ability to acquire targets or force us to divest an acquired business line. If we are unable to identify suitable targets or complete acquisitions, our growth prospects may suffer, and we may not be able to realize sufficient scale and technological advantages to compete effectively in all markets. To the extent that we complete acquisitions, we may be unsuccessful in integrating acquired companies or product lines with existing operations, or the integration may be more difficult or more costly than anticipated. We expect to incur substantial expenses related to the acquisition of Coherent and the related integration of Coherent and its subsidiaries. Some of the risks that may affect our ability to integrate or realize anticipated benefits from acquired companies, businesses, or assets include those associated with: •unexpected losses of key employees of the acquired company; •conforming the acquired company’s standards, processes, procedures, and controls with our operations, including integrating enterprise resource planning systems and other key business applications; •coordinating new product and process development; •increasing complexity from combining operations; •increasing the scope, geographic diversity, and complexity of our operations; •difficulties in consolidating facilities and transferring processes and know-how; •diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns; and•actions we may take in connection with acquisitions, such as: ◦using a significant portion of our available cash; ◦issuing equity securities, which would dilute current shareholders’ percentage ownership; ◦incurring significant debt; ◦incurring or assume contingent liabilities, known or unknown, including potential lawsuits, infringement actions, or similar liabilities; ◦incurring impairment charges related to goodwill or other intangibles; and ◦facing antitrust or other regulatory inquiries or actions.In addition, the market prices of our outstanding securities could be adversely affected if the effect of any acquisitions on our consolidated financial results is dilutive or is below the market’s or financial analysts’ expectations, or if there are unanticipated changes in the business or financial performance of the acquired or combined company. Any failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses may disrupt our business and adversely impact our business, results of operations, or financial condition.Although we expect that our acquisitions will result in cost savings, synergies, and other benefits, we may not realize those benefits, or be able to retain those benefits even if realized.The success of our acquisitions will depend in large part on our success in integrating the acquired operations, strategies, technologies, and personnel. We may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of an acquisition if the integration process takes longer than expected or is more costly than expected. If we fail to meet the challenges involved in successfully integrating any acquired operations or to otherwise realize any of the anticipated benefits of an acquisition, including any expected cost savings and synergies, our operations could be impaired. In addition, the overall integration of an acquired business can be a time-consuming and expensive process that, without proper planning and effective and timely implementation, could significantly disrupt our business.26Potential difficulties that we may encounter in the integration process include:•the integration of management teams, strategies, technologies and operations, products, and services;•the disruption of ongoing businesses and distraction of their respective management teams from ongoing business concerns;•the retention of, and possible decrease in business from, existing customers;•the creation of uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies, and information systems; •the reduction of the costs associated with combined operations;•the integration of corporate cultures and maintenance of employee morale;•the retention of key employees; and•potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired business.The anticipated cost savings, synergies, and other benefits of any acquisition typically assume a successful integration of the acquired business and are based on projections and other assumptions, which are inherently uncertain. Even if integration is successful, anticipated cost savings, synergies, and other benefits may not be achieved.Our future success depends on continued international sales, and our global operations are complex and present multiple challenges to manage. We anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. The failure to maintain our current volume of international sales could materially affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and/or cash flows. We manufacture products in numerous countries worldwide. Our operations vary by location and are influenced on a location-by-location basis by local customs, languages, and work practices, as well as different local weather conditions, management styles, and education systems. In addition, multiple complex issues may arise concurrently in different countries, potentially hampering our ability to respond in an effective and timely manner. Any inability to respond in an effective and timely manner to issues in our global operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.We may fail to accurately estimate the size and growth of our markets and our customers’ demands.We make significant decisions based on our estimates of customer requirements. We use our estimates to determine the levels of business we seek and accept, production schedules, personnel needs, and other resource requirements.Customers may require rapid increases in production on short notice. We may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or allocate sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet such increases in demand. Rapid customer ramp-up and significant increases in demand may strain our resources or negatively affect our margins. Inability to satisfy customer demand in a timely manner may harm our reputation, reduce our other opportunities, damage our relationships with customers, reduce revenue growth, and/or cause us to incur contractual penalties. Alternatively, downturns in the industries in which we compete may cause our customers to significantly reduce their demand. With respect to orders we initiate with our suppliers to address anticipated demand from our customers, certain suppliers may have required noncancellable purchase commitments or advance payments from us, and those obligations and commitments could reduce our ability to adjust our inventory or expense levels to reflect declining market demands. Unexpected declines in customer demands can result in excess or obsolete inventory and additional charges. Because certain of our sales, research and development, and internal manufacturing overhead expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in customer demand likely would decrease our gross margins and operating income.We may encounter increased competition, and we may fail to accurately estimate our competitors’ or our customers’ willingness and capability to backward integrate into our competencies and thereby displace us. We may encounter substantial competition from other companies in the same market, including established companies with significant resources. Some of our competitors may have financial, technical, marketing, or other capabilities that are more extensive than ours. They may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and other competitive pressures. We may not be able to compete successfully against our present or future competitors. Our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.A significant portion of our business may be subject to cyclical market factors. Our business is dependent on the demand for products produced by end-users of industrial lasers, optical communication products, components for semiconductor capital equipment, and components for 3D sensing. Many of these end-users are in industries that have historically experienced a highly cyclical demand for their products. As a result, demand for our products is subject to these cyclical fluctuations. Fluctuations in demand could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.27The long sales cycles for many of our products may cause us to incur significant expenses. Customers often view the purchase of our products as a significant and strategic decision. As a result, customers typically expend significant effort in evaluating, testing and qualifying our products before making a decision to purchase them, resulting in a lengthy design-in sales cycle. While our customers are evaluating our products and before they place an order with us, we may incur substantial sales and marketing and research and development expenses to customize our products to the customers’ needs. We may also expend significant management efforts, increase manufacturing capacity and increase inventory of long lead-time components or materials prior to receiving an order. Even after this evaluation process, a potential customer may not purchase our products. As a result, these long sales cycles may cause us to incur significant expenses without ever receiving revenues to offset such expenses.We have entered into supply agreements that commit us to supply products on specified terms. We have supply agreements with some customers that require us to supply products and allocate sufficient capacity to make these products. We have also agreed to pricing schedules and methodologies that could result in penalties if we fail to meet development, supply, capacity, and quality commitments. Failure to do so may cause us to be unable to generate the amount of revenue or the level of profitability we expect from these arrangements. Our ability to realize a profit under some of these agreements will be subject to the level of customer demand, the cost of maintaining facilities and manufacturing capacity, and supply chain capability. If we fail to fulfill our commitments under these supply agreements, our business, after using all remedies available, financial conditions, and results of operations may suffer a material adverse effect.We depend on highly complex manufacturing processes that require feeder materials, components, and products from limited sources of supply. Our operations are dependent upon a supply chain of difficult-to-make or difficult-to-refine products and materials. Some of our product inflow is subject to yield reductions from growth or fabrication losses, and thus the quantities we may receive are not consistently predictable. Customers may also change a specification for a product that our suppliers cannot meet.Some of our products, particularly in the OLED display industry, require designs and specifications that are at the cutting-edge of available technologies and change frequently to meet rapidly evolving market demands. By their very nature, the types of components used in such products can be difficult and unpredictable to manufacture and may only be available from a single supplier, which increases the risk that we may not obtain such components in a timely manner. Identifying alternative sources of supply for certain components could be difficult and costly, result in management distraction in assisting our current and future suppliers to meet our and our customers' technical requirements, and cause delays in shipments of our products while we identify, evaluate and test the products of alternative suppliers. Any such delay in shipment would result in a delay or cancellation of our ability to convert such order into revenues. Furthermore, financial or other difficulties faced by these suppliers or significant changes in demand for these components or materials could limit their availability. We continue to consolidate our supply base and move supplier locations. When we transition locations, we may increase our inventory of such products as a ""safety stock"" during the transition, which may cause the amount of inventory reflected on our balance sheet to increase. Additionally, many of our customers rely on sole source suppliers. In the event of a disruption of our customers' supply chain, orders from our customers could decrease or be delayed.We also make products of which we are one of the world’s largest suppliers. We use high-quality, optical-grade ZnSe in the production of many of our IR optical products. We are a leading producer of ZnSe for our internal use and for external sale. The production of ZnSe is a complex process requiring a highly controlled environment. A number of factors, including defective or contaminated materials, could adversely affect our ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields of high-quality ZnSe. Lack of adequate availability of high-quality ZnSe could have a material adverse effect upon our business. There can be no assurance that we will not experience manufacturing yield inefficiencies that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. We produce hydrogen selenide gas, which is used in our production of ZnSe. There are risks inherent in the production and handling of such material. Our lack of proper handling of hydrogen selenide could require us to curtail our production of the gas. Our potential inability to internally produce hydrogen selenide could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. In addition, we produce and use other high-purity and relatively uncommon materials and compounds to manufacture our products, including, but not limited to, ZnS, GaAs, yttrium aluminum garnet, yttrium lithium fluoride, calcium fluoride, germanium, selenium, telluride, Bi2Te3, and SiC. A significant failure of our internal production processes or our suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of these necessary materials on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.28Furthermore, we have historically relied exclusively on our own production capability to manufacture certain strategic components, crystals, semiconductor lasers, fiber, lasers and laser-based systems. We also manufacture certain large format optics. Because we manufacture, package and test these components, products and systems at our own facilities, and such components, products and systems are not readily available from other sources, any interruption in manufacturing would adversely affect our business.Delays in transportation of products and possible shortages of critical raw materials, parts, equipment and other resources may adversely affect our results of operations.Current challenges in global shipping and other aspects of commercial transportation, such as congestion in ports, a shortage in containers and a general lack of space on ships and trucks, have adversely impacted our operations. Because of this ongoing situation, we face a risk of continued supply chain disruptions. Additionally, our revenues and collections also may be adversely affected by transportation delays that could have a negative impact on the timing of payments that we receive under our sales arrangements. If these issues continue beyond the short term, our overall supply chain and our revenues derived from our sales flow could be adversely impacted.We participate in the microelectronics market, which requires significant research and development expenses to develop and maintain products and a failure to achieve market acceptance for our products could have a significant negative impact on our business and results of operations.The microelectronics market is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent product introductions, the volatility of product supply and demand, changing customer requirements and evolving industry standards. The nature of this market requires significant research and development expenses to participate, with substantial resources invested in advance of material sales of our products to our customers in this market. Additionally, our product offerings may become obsolete given the frequent introduction of alternative technologies. In the event either our customers’ or our products fail to gain market acceptance, or the microelectronics market fails to grow, it would likely have a significant negative effect on our business and results of operations.There are risks associated with our participation in the flat panel display market, including as a result of there being a relatively limited number of end customer manufacturers. In the flat panel display market, it is unclear when the timing will be, or whether it will occur at all, for any further build-out of fabs for the manufacture of OLED screens, and there are a relatively limited number of manufacturers who are the end customers for our annealing products. Given macroeconomic conditions, varying consumer demand and technical process limitations at manufacturers, we may see fluctuations in orders, including periods with no or few orders, and our customers may seek to reschedule or cancel orders.Additionally, challenges in meeting evolving technological requirements for these complex products by us and our suppliers could result in delays in shipments and rescheduled or cancelled orders by our customers. This could negatively impact our backlog, timing of revenues and results of operations.Increases in commodity prices may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of increases in commodity prices. Our businesses purchase, produce, and sell high-purity selenium and other raw materials based upon quoted market prices from minor metal exchanges. The negative impact from increases in commodity prices might not be recovered through our product sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings and financial condition.A widespread health crisis could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.The outbreak of a widespread health crisis, whether global in scope or localized in an area in which we, our customers or our suppliers do business, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and the operations of our suppliers and customers. Potential impacts on our operations include:•significant reductions in demand for one or more of our products or a curtailment to one or more of our product lines caused by, among other things, any temporary inability of our customers to purchase and utilize our products in next-stage manufacturing due to shutdown orders or financial hardship;•workforce constraints triggered by any applicable shutdown orders or stay-at-home polices; •disruptions to our third-party manufacturing and raw materials supply arrangements caused by constraints over our suppliers’ workforce capacity, financial, or operational difficulties;•disruption in our own ability to produce and ship products, including components we use in the production of other products;•heightened risk and uncertainty regarding the loss or disruption of essential third-party service providers, including transportation services, contract manufacturing, marketing, and distribution services;29•requirements to comply with governmental and regulatory responses such as quarantines, import/export restrictions, price controls, or other governmental or regulatory actions, including closures or other restrictions that limit or close our operating and manufacturing facilities, restrict our workforce’s ability to travel or perform necessary business functions, or otherwise impact our suppliers or customers, which could adversely impact our operating results; and•increased operating expenses and potentially reduced efficiency of operations. In the early stages of the outbreak of the global novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in 2020, we closely monitored the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business, including the impact to our suppliers, customers, and employees, as well as the impact to the countries and markets in which we operate. We began focusing intensely on mitigating the adverse impacts of COVID-19 on our foreign and domestic operations, starting by protecting our employees, suppliers, and customers. We have modified our business practices for the continued health and safety of our employees - including, among other things, implementing a remote work policy to the fullest extent possible, a limited travel policy, the distribution of and mandatory use of personal protective equipment, reorganizing and adjusting the timing of manufacturing personnel shifts, temperature monitoring for entering our facilities, and a social distancing policy - and we may take further actions, or be required to take further actions, that are in the best interests of our employees. Our suppliers, distributors and customers have also implemented similar measures, which has resulted in, and we expect it will continue to result in, disruptions or delays and higher costs. The implementation of health and safety practices by us or our suppliers, distributors or customers could impact customer demand, supplier deliveries, our productivity, and costs, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.While we believe that we have been successful in identifying, managing, and mitigating the economic disruption impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on us, we cannot provide any assurance that we similarly will be able to mitigate the impacts of any future widespread health crises, including as a result of any variants of COVID-19. Factors beyond our current knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of any outbreak, as well as any resulting governmental and regulatory actions, could cause any such crisis to have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.Global economic downturns may adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. Current and future conditions in the global economy have an inherent degree of uncertainty. As a result, it is difficult to estimate the level of growth or contraction of the global economy as a whole. It is even more difficult to estimate growth or contraction in various parts, sectors, and regions of the economy, including the industrial, aerospace and defense, optical communications, telecommunications, semiconductor, consumer, microelectronics, precision manufacturing, instrumentation, and life science markets in which we participate. All aspects of our forecasts depend on estimates of growth or contraction in the markets we serve. Thus, prevailing global economic uncertainties render estimates of future income and expenditures very difficult to make. Global economic downturns may affect industries in which our customers operate. These changes could include decreases in the rate of consumption or use of our customers’ products. Such conditions could have a material adverse effect on demand for our customers’ products and, in turn, on demand for our products. Adverse changes may occur in the future as a result of declining or flat global or regional economic conditions, fluctuations in currency and commodity prices, wavering confidence, capital expenditure reductions, unemployment, decline in stock markets, contraction of credit availability, or other factors affecting economic conditions. For example, factors that may affect our operating results include disruption in the credit and financial markets in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere, adverse effects of slowdowns in the U.S., European, Chinese or other Asian economies, reductions or limited growth in consumer spending or consumer credit, global trade tariffs, and other adverse economic conditions that may be specific to the Internet, e-commerce, and payments industries. These changes may negatively affect sales of products and increase exposure to losses from bad debt and commodity prices, the cost and availability of financing, and costs associated with manufacturing and distributing products. Any economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.Foreign currency risk may negatively affect our revenues, cost of sales, and operating margins, and could result in foreign exchange losses. We conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most countries in which we operate. We incur currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a different currency from the currency in which it operates, or holds assets or liabilities in a currency different from its functional currency. Changes in exchange rates can also affect our results of operations when the value of sales and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars. We cannot accurately predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations. Further, given the volatility of exchange rates, we may not be able to effectively manage our currency risks, and any volatility in currency exchange rates may increase the price of our products in local currency to our foreign customers or 30increase the manufacturing cost of our products, either of which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows, and profitability.We are subject to complex and rapidly changing import and export regulations which could limit our sales and decrease our profitability and we may be subject to legal and regulatory consequences if we do not comply with applicable export control laws and regulationsObtaining export licenses can be difficult, time-consuming and require interpretation of complex regulations. Failure to obtain export licenses for these shipments could significantly reduce our revenue and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, relationships with our customers and results of operations. Additionally, failure to comply with the various regulatory requirements could subject us to significant fines, suspension of export privileges or disbarment. Additionally, we are subject to the passage of and changes in the interpretation of regulation by U.S. government entities at the federal, state, and local levels and by non-U.S. agencies, including, but not limited to, the following: •We are required to comply with import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our ability to enter into or complete transactions with certain customers, business partners, and other persons. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services, and technologies. We may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item, and granting of a required license cannot be assured. Compliance with the import laws that apply to our businesses may restrict our access to, and may increase the cost of obtaining, certain products and could interrupt our supply of imported inventory.•Exported technologies necessary to develop and manufacture certain products are subject to U.S. export control laws and similar laws of other jurisdictions. We may be subject to adverse regulatory consequences, including government oversight of facilities and export transactions, monetary penalties, and other sanctions for violations of these laws. In certain instances, these regulations may prohibit us from developing or manufacturing certain of our products for specific applications outside the United States. Failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary, and nonmonetary penalties; disruptions to our business; limitations on our ability to import and export products and services; and damage to our reputation.Changes in trade policies, such as increased import duties, could increase the costs of goods imported into the United States or China. In March 2018, President Trump announced new steel and aluminum tariffs. Then, in July 2018, the United States imposed increased tariffs on products of Chinese origin, and China responded by increasing tariffs on U.S.-origin goods. On the export side, denial orders and placing companies on the U.S. entity list could decrease our access to customers and markets and materially impact our revenues in the aggregate. In April 2018, for example, the U.S. Department of Commerce issued a denial order against two companies in the telecommunications market. In 2019 and 2020, the U.S. Department of Commerce placed a number of entities, including Huawei, on the U.S. Entity List. If we cannot obtain relief from, or take other action to mitigate the impact of, these additional duties and restrictions and duties, our business and profits may be materially and adversely affected. Further changes in the trade policy of the United States or of other countries in which we do cross-border business, or additional sanctions, could result in retaliatory actions by other countries that could materially and negatively impact the volume of economic activity in the United States or globally, which, in turn, may decrease our access to customers and markets, reduce our revenues, and increase our operating costs. Our association with customers that are or become subject to U.S. regulatory scrutiny or export restrictions could negatively impact our business and create instability in our operations. Governmental actions such as these could subject us to actual or perceived reputational harm among current or prospective investors, suppliers or customers, customers of our customers, other parties doing business with us, or the general public. Any such reputational harm could result in the loss of investors, suppliers, or customers, which could harm our business, financial condition, operating results, or prospects.Exports of certain of our products are subject to export controls imposed by the U.S. government and administered by the U.S. Departments of State and Commerce. In certain instances, these regulations may require pre-shipment authorization from the administering department. For products subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), administered by the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security, the requirement for a license is dependent on the type and end use of the product, the final destination, the identity of the end user, and whether a license exception might apply. Virtually all exports of products subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), administered by the Department of State’s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, require a license. Certain of our products are subject to EAR controls. Additionally, certain other products that we sell, including certain products developed with government funding, are subject to ITAR. Products developed and manufactured in our foreign locations are subject to export controls of the applicable foreign nation. Given the current global political climate, obtaining export licenses can be difficult and time-consuming. Failure to obtain export licenses for these shipments, or having one or more of our customers be restricted from receiving exports from us, could significantly reduce our revenue and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of 31operations. Compliance with regulations of the United States and other governments also subjects us to additional fees and costs. The absence of comparable restrictions on competitors in other countries may adversely affect our competitive position. Our current credit agreement and any other credit or similar agreements into which we may enter in the future may restrict our operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions regarding our business.Our credit agreement, dated as of July 1, 2022, by and among us, the lenders and other parties thereto, and JP Morgan Chase Bank, NA, as administrative agent and collateral agent (the “New Credit Agreement”) contains a number of restrictive covenants that may impose operating and financial restrictions on us and limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interest, including restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness, grant liens, undergo certain fundamental changes, fund non-US operations, dispose of assets, make certain investments, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, and make certain restricted payments, in each case subject to limitations and exceptions set forth in the New Credit Agreement.The New Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default that include, among other things, certain payment defaults, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to other indebtedness, change of control defaults, judgment defaults, and bankruptcy and insolvency defaults. Such events of default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, and financial results. Furthermore, if we are unable to repay the amounts due and payable under the New Credit Agreement, those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness, which could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation. In the event that our lenders accelerated the repayment of the borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. Any acceleration of amounts due under the New Credit Agreement would likely have a material adverse effect on us. As a result of these restrictions, we may be limited in how we conduct business, unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns, or unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.In addition, we may enter into other credit agreements or other debt arrangements from time to time which contain similar or more extensive restrictive covenants and events of default, in which case we may face similar or additional limitations as a result of the terms of those credit agreements or other debt arrangements.Any inability to access financial markets from time to time to raise required capital, finance our working capital requirements or our acquisition strategies, or otherwise support our liquidity needs could negatively impact our ability to finance our operations, meet certain obligations, or implement our growth strategy. We from time to time borrow under our existing credit facility or use proceeds from sales of our securities to fund portions of our operations, including working capital investments and financing of our acquisition strategies. In the past, market disruptions experienced in the United States and abroad have materially impacted liquidity in the credit and debt markets, making financing terms for borrowers less attractive and, in certain cases, have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of financing. Uncertainty in the financial markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing or to refinance our existing debt arrangements on favorable terms or at all, which could negatively affect our ability to fund current and future expansion as well as future acquisitions and development. These disruptions may include turmoil in the financial services industry, volatility in the markets where our outstanding securities trade, and changes in general economic conditions in the areas where we do business. If we are unable to access funds at competitive rates, or if our short-term or long-term borrowing costs increase, our ability to finance our operations, meet our short-term obligations, and implement our operating strategies could be adversely affected.In the future, we may be required to raise additional capital through public or private financing or other arrangements. Such financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all, and our failure to raise capital when needed could harm our business and prospects. Additional equity financing may be dilutive to the holders of our outstanding capital stock, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to undertake certain activities that we otherwise would find to be desirable. Further, debt service obligations associated with any debt financing could reduce our profitability. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to grow our business or respond to competitive pressures.There are limitations on the protection of our intellectual property, and we may from time to time be involved in costly intellectual property litigation or indemnification. We rely on a combination of trade secret, patent, copyright, and trademark laws, combined with employee confidentiality, noncompetition, and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance that the steps we take will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or intellectual property. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future. Asserting our intellectual property rights or defending against third-party claims could involve substantial expense. In the event that a third party were successful in a claim that one of our processes infringed its proprietary rights, we could be required to pay substantial damages or royalties, or spend substantial amounts in order to obtain a license or modify processes so that they 32no longer infringe such proprietary rights. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.The design, processes, and specialized equipment utilized in our engineered materials, advanced components, and subsystems are innovative, complex, and difficult to duplicate. However, there can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent similar technology, or that all aspects of our proprietary technology will be protected. Others have obtained patents covering a variety of materials, devices, equipment, configurations, and processes, and others could obtain patents covering technology similar to ours. We may be required to obtain licenses under such patents, and there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain such licenses, if required, on commercially reasonable terms, or that claims regarding rights to technology will not be asserted that may adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, our research and development contracts with agencies of the U.S. government present a risk that project-specific technology could be disclosed to competitors as contract reporting requirements are fulfilled. We also enter into development projects from time to time that might result in intellectual property developed during a project that is assigned to the other party without us retaining rights to that intellectual property or is jointly owned with the other party.Our global operations are subject to complex legal and regulatory requirements. We manufacture products in numerous countries worldwide. Operations inside and outside of the United States are subject to many legal and regulatory requirements, some of which are not aligned with others. These include tariffs, quotas, taxes and other market barriers, restrictions on the export or import of technology, potentially limited intellectual property protection, import and export requirements and restrictions, anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, foreign investment rules and regulations, data privacy requirements, competition laws, employment and labor laws, pensions and social insurance, and environmental health and safety laws and regulations. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be onerous and expensive, and requirements differ among jurisdictions. New laws, changes in existing laws, and abrogation of local regulations by national laws may result in significant uncertainties in how they will be interpreted and enforced. Failure to comply with any of these foreign laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.We may face particular data privacy and security and data protection risks due to laws and regulations regulating the protection or security of personal and other sensitive data.We may face particular data privacy and security and data protection risks due to laws and regulations regulating the protection or security of personal and other sensitive data, including in particular several laws and regulations that have recently been enacted or adopted or are likely to be enacted or adopted in the future. For instance, effective May 25, 2018, the European General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) imposed additional obligations and risk upon our business and increased substantially the penalties to which we could be subject in the event of any non-compliance. GDPR requires companies to satisfy requirements regarding the handling of personal data (generally, of EU residents), including its use, protection and the rights of affected persons regarding their data. Failure to comply with GDPR requirements could result in fines of up to 20 million Euro or 4% of global annual revenues, whichever is higher. We have taken extensive measures to ensure compliance with GDPR and to minimize the risk of incurring any penalties and we continue to adapt to the developing interpretation and enforcement of GDPR as well as emerging best practice standards. For example, we have introduced an international Data Protection Organization, a European Data Protection Policy, a system for Data Protection Management and Documentation and implemented an international Intra Group Data Transfer Agreement including the EU Standard Contractual Clauses. In addition, several other jurisdictions around the world have recently enacted privacy laws or regulations similar to GDPR. For instance, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which became effective January 1, 2020 and which gives consumers many of the same rights as those available under GDPR. Several laws similar to the CCPA have been proposed in the United States at both the federal and state level. Like GDPR, other similar laws and regulations, as well as any associated inquiries or investigations or any other government actions, may be costly to comply with, result in negative publicity, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, and subject us to remedies that may harm our business.There also have also been recent significant developments concerning privacy and data security in China, where we have significant operations. For example, the Data Security Law of the People’s Republic of China (the “Data Security Law”) took effect in September 2021. The Data Security Law imposes data security and privacy obligations on entities and individuals carrying out data processing activities and also introduces a data classification and hierarchical protection system based on the importance of data in economic and social development and the degree of harm it may cause to national security, public interests, or legitimate rights and interests of individuals or organizations if such data are tampered with, destroyed, leaked, illegally acquired, or illegally used. The appropriate level of protection measures is required to be taken for each respective category of data. Further, the Personal Information Protection Law (the “PIPL”) took effect in China in November 2021. The PIPL raises the protection requirements for processing personal information. Because many specific requirements of the PIPL remain to be clarified, the ultimate impact of the PIPL currently is unknown. Fines for PIPL violations range from $7.7M to up 33to 5% of the infringing company’s previous year’s revenues. We may be required to make adjustments to our business practices to comply with the personal information protection laws and regulations in China.Data breach incidents and breakdowns of information and communication technologies could disrupt our operations and impact our financial results.In the course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property (both our own and that of our customers), as well as proprietary business information. We could be subject to service outages or breaches of security systems which may result in disruption, unauthorized access, misappropriation, or corruption of this information. Security breaches of our network or data, including physical or electronic break-ins, vendor service outages, computer viruses, attacks by hackers or similar breaches can create system disruptions, shutdowns, and unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. If we are unable to prevent or contain such security or privacy breaches, our operations could be disrupted or we could suffer legal claims, loss of reputation, financial loss, property damage, or regulatory penalties.We use and generate potentially hazardous substances that are subject to stringent environmental regulations. Hazardous substances used or generated in some of our research and manufacturing facilities are subject to stringent environmental regulation. We believe that our handling of such substances is in material compliance with applicable environmental, safety, and health regulations at each operating location. We invest substantially in proper personal protective equipment and process controls, including monitoring and specialized training, to minimize risks to employees, surrounding communities, and the environment that could result from the presence and handling of such hazardous substances. When exposure problems or potential exposure problems have been uncovered, corrective actions have been implemented, and re-occurrence has been minimal or nonexistent. We have in place emergency response plans with respect to our generation and use of the hazardous gases, which include hydrogen selenide, hydrogen sulfide, arsine, phosphine, and silane. Special attention has been given to all procedures pertaining to these gaseous materials to minimize the chance of accidental release into the atmosphere and to provide for an integrated system for monitoring and mitigating risk. With respect to the manufacturing, use, storage, and disposal of the low-level radioactive material thorium fluoride, our facilities and procedures have been inspected and licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Thorium-bearing by-products are collected and shipped as solid waste to a government-approved low-level radioactive waste disposal site in Clive, Utah. The generation, use, collection, storage, and disposal of all other hazardous by-products, such as suspended solids containing heavy metals or airborne particulates, are believed by us to be in material compliance with regulations. We believe that we have obtained all of the permits and licenses required for operation of our business.From time to time new regulations are enacted, and it is difficult to anticipate how such regulations will be implemented and enforced. We continue to evaluate the necessary steps for compliance with regulations as they are enacted. The implementation of such regulations may require us to incur additional costs and expend internal resources. Although we do not know of any material environmental, safety, or health problems in our properties, processes, or products, there can be no assurance that problems will not develop in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.We have a substantial amount of debt, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations and prevent us from fulfilling our debt-related obligations.As of June 30, 2022, we had approximately $2.3 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis. Immediately following the closing of the Coherent acquisition on July 1, 2022, we had $5.0 billion of outstanding indebtedness, including under (i) our $850 million senior secured term loan A facility (the “Term A Facility”), our $2.8 billion senior secured term loan B facility (the “Term Loan B Facility”, and together with the Term A Facility, the “Senior Credit Facilities”) and (ii) our $990 million 5.000% senior notes due 2029 (the “2029 Notes”). Additionally we have $350 million of undrawn capacity under our senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility. We may also incur additional indebtedness in the future by entering into new financing arrangements. Our indebtedness could have important consequences for us, including:•making it difficult for us to satisfy all of our obligations with respect to our debt, or to our trade or other creditors;•increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions;•limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions, particularly when the availability of financing in the capital markets is limited;•requiring us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing or on our variable-rate indebtedness if interest rates rise;•requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations and the proceeds of any capital markets offerings or loan borrowings for the payment of interest on our debt and reducing our ability to use our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and general corporate requirements;34•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate; and•placing us at a competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors. We may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, together with any future borrowings, to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, on or before its maturity. We may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, we may incur additional indebtedness in order to finance our operations, fund acquisitions, or repay existing indebtedness. If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, pursuing sales of additional debt or equity securities, or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments, or alliances. Any such actions, if necessary, may not be able to be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or on terms that would be advantageous to our stockholders, or on terms that would not require us to breach the terms and conditions of our existing or future debt agreements.Certain of our financial arrangements, including our Senior Credit Facilities, are made at variable rates that use interbank offered rates, or IBORs, including the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR (or metrics derived from or related to LIBOR), as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. IBORs are or have been reformed, may cease to be available or may be declared to be no longer representative of the underlying market and economic realities. In such a case IBORs and specifically LIBOR may need to be replaced with a replacement rate. In March 2021, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to cease or otherwise declare as no longer representative certain LIBOR settings on December 31, 2021 and the remainder of the U.S. dollar LIBOR settings on June 30, 2023. The New Credit Agreement contains provisions addressing the end of the use of LIBOR as a benchmark rate of interest and a mechanism for determining an alternative benchmark rate of interest. At this time, we cannot predict how markets will respond to reform or the proposed alternative rates or the effect of any changes to IBORs or the discontinuation or non-representativeness of LIBOR. New methods of calculating IBORs that may be established or the establishment of alternative reference rates could have an adverse impact on the market value for or value of IBOR-linked securities, loans and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us. Changes in market interest rates may influence our financing costs, returns on financial investments and the valuation of derivative contracts and could reduce our earnings and cash flows. There is no guarantee that a transition from IBORs and specifically LIBOR to an alternative will not result in financial market disruptions, significant increases in benchmark rates, or borrowing costs to borrowers, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.The agreements that govern our senior credit facilities and our 2029 Notes contain various covenants that impose restrictions on our business, which may affect our ability to operate our businesses.The New Credit Agreement and the Indenture, dated as of December 10, 2021 (the “Indenture), which provides for the 2029 Notes, contain various affirmative and negative covenants that will, subject to certain significant exceptions, restrict our ability to, among other things, have liens on our property, incur additional indebtedness, enter into sale and lease-back transactions, make loans, advances or other investments, make non-ordinary course asset sales, declare or pay dividends or make other distributions with respect to equity interests, and/or merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or convey certain of our assets to any one person, among other things. In addition, the Term Loan A Facility and Revolving Credit Facility require that the Company maintain (i) a maximum total net leverage ratio, as defined in the New Credit Agreement, initially of 5.25 to 1.00 as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, commencing with the end of the first full fiscal quarter after the Closing Date, stepping down to 4.00 to 1.00 at December 31, 2023 and thereafter and (ii) an interest coverage ratio, as defined in the New Credit Agreement, of at least 2.50 to 1.00. Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate our repayment obligations under the New Credit Agreement or the Indenture, as applicable. If such indebtedness is accelerated, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial resources or that we will be able to arrange financing to repay our borrowings at such time. Unfavorable changes in tax rates, tax liabilities, or tax accounting rules could negatively affect future results.As a global company, we are subject to taxation in the United States and various other countries and jurisdictions. As such, we must exercise a level of judgment in determining our worldwide tax liabilities. Our future tax rates could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in countries with differing tax rates or changes in tax laws as well as changes in our current or future global corporate structure. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significantly adverse impact on our effective tax rate, including the newly-enacted “Inflation Reduction Act of 2022” and the two-pillar solution for a global minimum level of taxation by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”). We are also impacted by the establishment or release of valuation allowances against deferred tax assets, changes in generally accepted accounting principles and continued eligibility for tax holiday benefits.35The enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) in December 2017 significantly affected U.S. tax law by changing how the United States imposes tax on multinational corporations. The U.S. Department of Treasury has broad authority under the Tax Act to issue regulations and interpretive guidance. We have applied available guidance to estimate our tax obligations, but new guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department may cause us to make adjustments to our tax estimates in future periods. In addition, we are subject to regular examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. This includes challenges to our intercompany transfer pricing arrangements and charges and the appropriate level of profitability for our entities. We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations and Competent Authority processes to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provision and accruals, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operation, or financial condition.Natural disasters or other global or regional catastrophic events could disrupt our operations, give rise to substantial environmental hazards, and adversely affect our results. We may be exposed to business interruptions due to extreme weather caused by climate change and deforestation, force majeure catastrophes, natural disaster, pandemic, terrorism, or acts of war that are beyond our control. Disruptions to our facilities or systems, or to those of our key suppliers, could also interrupt operational processes and adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products and provide services and support to our customers. As a result, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.A substantial portion of our research and development activities, manufacturing, and other critical business operations are located near major earthquake faults, for example in Santa Clara, California, an area with a history of seismic events. Any such loss or detrimental impact to any of our operations, logistics or facilities could disrupt our operations, delay production, shipments and revenues and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility. While we have obtained insurance to cover most potential losses, after reviewing the costs and limitations associated with earthquake insurance, we have decided not to procure such insurance. We believe that this decision is consistent with decisions reached by numerous other companies located nearby. We cannot assure you that our existing insurance coverage will be adequate against all other possible losses.Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting conflict has had a negative impact on our business, may continue to negatively impact our business and may have a negative impact on our results of operations.In February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine, resulting in the United States, Canada, the European Union (“EU”) and other countries imposing economic sanctions on Russia, some of which have been expanded to include Belarus. The military conflict and the resulting sanctions have caused and are expected to continue to cause significant disruptions in logistics, availability of components and supplies used in the manufacture and services of our products and global markets. The largest source of certain gases which are utilized in the application and servicing of some of our laser products has historically been located in Ukraine. We have accelerated purchases of these gases from other limited sources outside of the conflict zone and, to date, we have avoided any material disruption to our business. Similarly, our end customers for these products are largely located in geographies which have access to these gases from local suppliers.A material reduction in our access to critical supplies, the disruption in the ability to source components and supplies used in the manufacture, service or use of our products and the availability of shipping and the increased costs therefor would likely negatively impact the results of our operations. Additionally, the consequences of the foregoing or other limitation on the availability of fuels to provide electricity in the EU to businesses at the same current levels could have a material adverse effect on our business, particularly with regard to our ability to manufacture and ship products at our manufacturing locations in Germany, and is likely to result in higher operating costs. Our success requires us to attract, retain, and develop key personnel and maintain good relations with our employees.We are highly dependent upon the experience and continuing services of certain scientists, engineers, production, and management personnel. Competition for the services of these personnel is intense. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain or attract the personnel necessary for our success. The loss of the services of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.We contract with a number of large end-user service providers and product companies that have considerable bargaining power, which may require us to agree to terms and conditions that could have an adverse effect on our business or ability to recognize revenues. Large end-user service providers and product companies comprise a significant portion of our customer base. These customers generally have greater purchasing power than smaller entities and, accordingly, often request and receive more favorable terms from suppliers, including us. As we seek to expand our sales to existing customers and acquire new customers, we may be 36required to agree to terms and conditions that are favorable to our customers and that may affect the timing of our ability to recognize revenue, increase our costs, and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Furthermore, large customers have increased buying power and ability to require onerous terms in our contracts with them, including pricing, warranties, and indemnification terms. If we are unable to satisfy the terms of these contracts, it could result in liabilities of a material nature, including litigation, damages, additional costs, loss of market share, and loss of reputation. Additionally, the terms these large customers require, such as most-favored customer or exclusivity provisions, may impact our ability to do business with other customers and generate revenues from such customers. We may be adversely affected by climate change regulations. In many of the countries in which we operate, government bodies are increasingly enacting legislation and regulations in response to potential impacts of climate change. These laws and regulations may be mandatory. They have the potential to impact our operations directly or indirectly as a result of required compliance by our customers or our supply chain. Inconsistency of regulations may also affect the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations. Assessments of the potential impact of future climate change legislation, regulation, and international treaties and accords are uncertain, given the wide scope of potential regulatory change in countries in which we operate. We may incur increased capital expenditures resulting from required compliance with revised or new legislation or regulations, added costs to purchase raw materials, lower profits from sales of our products, allowances or credits under a “cap and trade” system, increased insurance premiums and deductibles as new actuarial tables are developed to reshape coverage, changes in competitive position relative to industry peers, changes to profit or loss arising from increased or decreased demand for goods produced by us, or changes in costs of goods sold.Some of our business units depend from time to time on large purchases from a few significant customers, and any loss, cancellation, reduction, or delay in purchases by these customers could harm the longevity of the business.A small number of customers have consistently accounted for a significant portion of our revenues, although none individually represent greater than 10% of total revenues. Our success will depend on our continued ability to develop and manage relationships with our major customers. Although we are attempting to expand our customer base, we expect that significant customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future. We may not be able to offset any decline in revenues from our existing major customers with revenues from new customers, and our quarterly results may be volatile because we are dependent on large orders from these customers that may be reduced, delayed, or cancelled. The markets in which we have historically sold our optical subsystems and components products are dominated by a relatively small number of systems manufacturers, thereby limiting the number of our potential customers. Our dependence on large orders from a relatively small number of customers makes our relationship with each customer critically important to our business. We cannot ensure that we will be able to retain our major customers, attract additional customers, or that our customers will be successful in selling their products that incorporate our products. In addition, governmental trade action or economic sanctions may limit or preclude our ability to do business with certain customers. We have in the past experienced delays and reductions in orders from some of our major customers. In addition, our customers have in the past sought price concessions from us, and we expect that they will continue to do so in the future. Expense reduction measures that we have implemented over the past several years, and additional action we are taking to reduce costs, may adversely affect our ability to introduce new and improved products, which may, in turn, adversely affect our relationships with some of our key customers. Further, some of our customers may in the future shift their purchases of products from us to our competitors or to joint ventures between these customers and our competitors, or may in certain circumstances produce competitive products themselves. The loss of one or more of our major customers, any reduction or delay in sales to these customers, our inability to successfully develop relationships with additional customers, or future price concessions that we may make could significantly harm our business. Our operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to manufacture certain products in our manufacturing facilities. We manufacture some of the components that we incorporate into our subsystem products; in other cases, we provide components to contract manufacturers to produce finished goods. For some of the components and finished goods, we are the sole manufacturer. Our manufacturing processes are highly complex, and issues are often difficult to detect and correct. From time to time we have experienced problems achieving acceptable yields in our manufacturing facilities, resulting in delays in the availability of our products. In addition, if we experience problems with our manufacturing facilities, it would be costly and require a long period of time to move the manufacture of these components and finished good products to a different facility or contract manufacturer, which could result in interruptions in supply and would likely materially impact our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, for a variety of reasons, including changes in circumstances at our contract manufacturers or our own business strategies, we may voluntarily, or be required to, transfer the manufacturing of certain products to other manufacturing sites. 37Changes in manufacturing processes are often required due to changes in product specifications, changing customer needs, and the introduction of new products. These changes may reduce manufacturing yields at our contract manufacturers and at our own manufacturing facilities, resulting in reduced margins on those products. Also, our ability to control the quality of products produced by contract manufacturers may be limited and quality issues may not be resolved in a timely manner, which could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations. In addition, many of our products are sourced from suppliers based outside of the United States, primarily in Asia. Uncertainty with respect to tax and trade policies, tariffs, and government regulations affecting trade between the United States and other countries has recently increased. Major developments in tax policy or trade relations, such as the imposition of tariffs on imported products, could increase our product and product-related costs or require us to seek alternative suppliers, either of which could result in decreased sales or increased product and product-related costs. Failure to accurately forecast our revenues could result in additional charges for obsolete or excess inventories or noncancellable purchase commitments. We base many of our operating decisions, and enter into purchase commitments, on the basis of anticipated revenue trends that are highly unpredictable. Some of our purchase commitments are not cancellable, and in some cases we are required to recognize a charge representing an amount of material or capital equipment purchased or ordered that exceeds our actual requirements. Should revenues in future periods fall substantially below our expectations, or should we fail to accurately forecast changes in demand mix, we could be required to record substantial charges for obsolete or excess inventories or noncancellable purchase commitments.Our markets are unpredictable and characterized by rapid technological changes and evolving standards demanding a significant investment in research and development, and, if we fail to address changing market conditions, our business and operating results will be harmed.The photonics industry is characterized by extensive research and development, rapid technological change, frequent new product introductions, changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards. Because this industry is subject to rapid change, it is difficult to predict its potential size or future growth rate. Our success in generating net sales in this industry will depend on, among other things:•maintaining and enhancing our relationships with our customers;•the education of potential end-user customers about the benefits of lasers and laser systems; and•our ability to accurately predict and develop our products to meet industry standards.We cannot assure you that our expenditures for research and development will result in the introduction of new products or, if such products are introduced, that those products will achieve sufficient market acceptance or to generate sales to offset the costs of development. Our failure to address rapid technological changes in our markets could adversely affect our business and results of operations.If our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered in determining whether a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets may not be recoverable include declines in our stock price and market capitalization or future cash flows projections. A decline in our stock price, or any other adverse change in market conditions, particularly if such change has the effect of changing one of the critical assumptions or estimates we used to calculate the estimated fair value of our reporting units, could result in a change to the estimation of fair value that could result in an impairment charge. Any such material charges, whether related to goodwill or purchased intangible assets, may have a material negative impact on our financial and operating results.If we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired. As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (“the Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), and Nasdaq listing requirements. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources, including accounting-related costs and significant management oversight. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement, could delay the reporting of our financial results or cause us to be subject to investigations, enforcement actions by regulatory agencies, stockholder lawsuits, or other adverse actions requiring us to incur defense costs or pay fines, settlements, or 38judgments. Any such failures or difficulties could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Risks Relating to Our Capital StockThe trading prices for our securities have been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future.The trading prices for our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market Composite varied between a high of $75.23 per share and a low of $50.14 per share in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. Likewise, the trading prices of our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock varied between a high of $308.50 per share and a low of $215.02 per share in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. The market prices of our securities could fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including the following:•future announcements concerning us or our competitors;•the overall performance of equity markets;•the trading volume of our securities;•additions or changes to our board of directors, management, or key personnel;•regulatory actions (including, but not limited to, developments in international trade policy) and enforcement actions bearing on manufacturing, development, marketing, or sales;•the commencement or outcome of litigation;•reports and recommendations of analysts and whether or not we meet the milestones, metrics, and other expectations set forth in such reports;•gaining or losing large customers;•the introduction of new products or services and market acceptance of such products or services;•fluctuations in demand for our products or downturns in the industries that we serve, particularly the continued build-out of the capacity for the manufacture of OLED and the increased use of the installed base of our products in such manufacturing;•the impact of any public health crisis on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects or those of our customers and suppliers;•the acquisition or loss of significant manufacturers, distributors, or suppliers or an inability to obtain sufficient quantities of materials needed to provide our services;•the issuance of common stock or other securities (including shares of common stock issued upon conversion of any shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock or upon conversion of our outstanding convertible notes);•incurrence of indebtedness;•quarterly variations in operating results;•our ability to accurately forecast future performance;•business acquisitions or divestitures;•fluctuations in the economy, political events, or general market conditions; and•changes in our operating industry generally.In addition, stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years, including as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, these fluctuations frequently have been unrelated to the operating performance or underlying fundamentals of the affected companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. These fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance or out of our control, and could lead to securities class action litigation that could result in substantial expenses and diversion of management’s attention and corporate resources, any or all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.We expect that the market price of our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock will be influenced by yield and interest rates in the capital markets, the time remaining to the mandatory conversion date applicable to the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, our creditworthiness, and the occurrence of certain events affecting us that do not require an adjustment to the fixed conversion rates of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. Fluctuations in yield rates in particular may give rise to arbitrage opportunities based upon changes in the relative values of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and our common stock. Any such arbitrage could, in turn, affect the market prices of our common stock and the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. The market price of our common stock could also be affected by possible sales of our common stock by investors who view the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock as a more attractive means of equity participation in us and by hedging or arbitrage trading activity that we expect to develop involving our common stock. This trading activity could, in turn, affect the market price of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock.Provisions in our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws and the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law may delay or prevent our acquisition by a third party, which could also reduce the market price of our capital stock. 39Our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws contain provisions that could make us a less attractive target for a hostile takeover and could make more difficult or discourage a merger proposal, a tender offer, or a proxy contest. Such provisions include:•a requirement that shareholder-nominated director nominees be nominated in advance of the meeting at which directors are elected and that specific information be provided in connection with such nomination;•the ability of our board of directors to issue additional shares of common stock or preferred stock without shareholder approval; and•certain provisions requiring supermajority approval (at least two-thirds of the votes cast by all shareholders entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class).In addition, the BCL contains provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our control or changes in our management. Many of these provisions are triggered if any person or group acquires, or discloses the intent to acquire, 20% or more of a corporation’s voting power, subject to certain exceptions. These provisions:•provide the other shareholders of the corporation with certain rights against the acquiring group or person;•prohibit the corporation from engaging in a broad range of business combinations with the acquiring group or person;•restrict the voting and other rights of the acquiring group or person; and•provide that certain profits realized by the acquiring group or person from the sale of our equity securities belong to and are recoverable by us.Regardless of the amount of a person’s holdings, if a shareholder or shareholder group (including affiliated persons) would be a party to certain proposed transactions with us or would be treated differently from other shareholders of ours in certain proposed transactions, the BCL requires approval by a majority of votes entitled to be cast by all shareholders other than the interested shareholder or affiliate group, unless the transaction is approved by independent directors or other criteria are satisfied. Furthermore, under the BCL, a “short-form” merger of II-VI cannot be implemented without the consent of our board of directors.In addition, as permitted by Pennsylvania law, an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation or other corporate action that is approved by shareholders may provide mandatory special treatment for specified groups of nonconsenting shareholders of the same class. For example, an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation or other corporate action may provide that shares of common stock held by designated shareholders of record must be cashed out at a price determined by the Company, subject to applicable dissenters’ rights.Furthermore, the BCL provides that directors, in discharging their duties, may consider, to the extent they deem appropriate, the effects of any action upon shareholders, employees, suppliers, customers, and the communities in which the corporation’s offices are located. Directors are not required to consider the interests of shareholders to a greater degree than other constituencies’ interests. The BCL expressly provides that directors do not violate their fiduciary duties solely by relying on “poison pills” or the anti-takeover provisions of the BCL. We do not currently have a “poison pill.”All of these provisions may limit the price that investors may be willing to pay for shares of our capital stock.In addition, certain rights of the holders of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. For example, if any of certain fundamental changes were to occur on or prior to July 1, 2023, holders of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock may have the right to convert their Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, at an increased conversion rate and will also be entitled to receive a make-whole amount equal to the present value of all remaining dividend payments on their Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, as described in the applicable Statement with Respect to Shares governing the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. Likewise, if any of certain fundamental changes were to occur, we or the surviving entity would be required to make an offer to repurchase, at the option and election of the holders thereof, for cash each share of Series B Preferred Stock then outstanding. These features of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management.We do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock, holders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value and by the intended anti-dilution actions of our share-buyback program.We have never declared nor paid dividends on our common stock and do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings to support operations and to finance the development of our business. As a result, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon future appreciation in its value. There is no guarantee that our common stock will maintain its value or appreciate in value.40Our ability to declare and pay dividends on our capital stock may be limited, including by the terms of our existing Credit Agreement.Our declaration and payment of dividends on our capital stock in the future will be determined by our board of directors (or an authorized committee thereof) in its sole discretion and will depend on our financial condition, earnings, growth prospects, other uses of cash, funding requirements, applicable Pennsylvania law, and other factors our board of directors deems relevant.The terms of the New Credit Agreement contain a restriction on our ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock. If the terms of the New Credit Agreement restrict our ability to pay cash dividends on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, we will pay any dividends declared by our board of directors (or an authorized committee thereof) on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock in the form of shares of common stock. In addition, credit facilities, indentures, or other financing agreements that we enter into in the future may contain provisions that restrict or prohibit our ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock.In addition, under Pennsylvania law, our board of directors may not pay dividends if after giving effect to the relevant dividend payment we (i) would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of our business or (ii) our total assets would not be greater than or equal to the sum of our total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed if we were to be dissolved at the time as of which the dividend is measured, in order to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of shareholders whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the dividend. Even if we are permitted under our contractual obligations and Pennsylvania law to pay cash dividends on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, we may not have sufficient cash to pay cash dividends on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred StockTrading in preferred stock that we have issued may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.The market price of our common stock is likely to be influenced by the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and, to the extent that markets develop when applicable trading limitations no longer apply, our Series B Preferred Stock. For example, the market price of our common stock could become more volatile and could depress possible sales of our common stock to shareholders who view the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock as more attractive means of equity participation in us than owning shares of our common stock.Our common stock is subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness; the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock; and any other preferred stock we may issue in the future. Our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock rank junior to all of our and our subsidiaries’ consolidated liabilities.Shares of our common stock are equity interests that rank junior to all indebtedness and other non-equity claims on us with respect to assets available to satisfy our claims, including in a liquidation of the Company. Additionally, holders of our common stock may be subject to prior dividend and liquidation rights of any holders of our preferred stock or depositary shares representing such preferred stock then outstanding.Our common stock ranks junior to our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends and amounts payable in the event of our liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of our affairs. This means that, unless accumulated dividends have been paid on all the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock then outstanding through the most recently completed dividend period, no dividends may be declared or paid on our common stock and we will not be permitted to repurchase any of our common stock, subject to limited exceptions. Likewise, in the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of our affairs, no distribution of our assets may be made to holders of our common stock until we have paid to holders of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock then outstanding the applicable liquidation preferences.In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of our affairs, our assets will be available to pay obligations on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock only after all of our consolidated liabilities have been paid. In addition, the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock rank structurally junior to all existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of our affairs, there may not be sufficient assets remaining, after paying our and our subsidiaries’ liabilities, to pay amounts due on any or all of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock then outstanding.Our board of directors can issue, without approval of the holders of our common stock, preferred stock with voting and conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock, the rights of holders of shares of our capital stock, or the market price of our capital stock.Our Articles of Incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue one or more additional series of preferred stock and set the terms of the preferred stock without seeking any further approval from our shareholders. Any preferred stock that is issued will rank ahead of our common stock in terms of dividends and liquidation rights. If we issue additional preferred stock, it may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Our board of directors also has the power, without shareholder approval, subject to applicable law, to set the terms of any such series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting 41rights, dividend rights, preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends, and other terms, or upon our liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of our affairs. If we issue additional preferred stock in the future that has a preference over our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of our affairs, or if we issue additional preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock, the rights of holders of our capital stock or the market price of our capital stock could be adversely affected. The issuance of preferred stock or even the ability to issue preferred stock could also have the effect of delaying, deterring, or preventing a change of control or other corporate action.The redemption rights of the holders of Series B Preferred Stock may result in the use of our cash in such a way that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.At any time on or after the ten-year anniversary of the applicable issuance date of the shares of our Series B Preferred Stock and subject to the procedures set forth in the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock, each holder of such shares will have the right to require us to redeem all of such holder’s shares for cash at a price per share equal to the sum of the applicable stated value for such shares plus accrued or declared and unpaid dividends on such shares that had not previously been added to such stated value. This may have the effect of reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, thereby negatively affecting the interests of holders of our other capital stock, including our common stock and our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. Holders of our Series B Preferred Stock can exercise significant control over us, which could limit the ability of holders of our other capital stock to influence the outcome of key transactions, including a change of control. Our Series B Preferred Stock has voting rights, allowing holders to vote as one class with our common stock on an as-converted basis, subject to limited exceptions. As a result, the holders of Series B Preferred Stock have the ability to significantly influence the outcome of any matter submitted for the vote of the holders of our common stock. Holders of Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to act separately in their own respective interests with respect to their ownership interests in us and have the ability to substantially influence all matters that require approval by our shareholders, including the approval of significant corporate transactions. Additionally, we may not undertake certain actions without the prior written approval of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock, voting separately from our common stock. Subject to certain exceptions, we must not: (1) alter or change the rights, preferences or privileges of our Series B Preferred Stock or amend, modify or supplement any provision of our organizational documents in a manner that adversely affects the rights, powers, preferences or privileges of our Series B Preferred Stock; (2) authorize or issue any senior stock (or securities convertible into senior stock), or amend or alter our articles of incorporation to increase the number of authorized or issued shares of our Series B Preferred Stock; (3) decrease the number of authorized shares of our Series B Preferred Stock (other than as permitted pursuant to a conversion, redemption or repurchase by us thereof); (4) issue any shares of our Series B Preferred Stock (other than pursuant to the amended and restated invested agreement, entered into on March 30, 2021, by and between Bain Capital Private Equity, LP (“BCPE”) and us (the “Investment Agreement”); and (5) effect any voluntary deregistration or delisting with Nasdaq of our common stock. Furthermore, we may not, unless holders of Series B Preferred Stock otherwise consent in writing (or if such action is taken with respect to a Permitted Issuance (as defined in the Investment Agreement)), so long as BCPE owns at least 5% of the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock that it held immediately following the issuance and sale of the Series B-2 Preferred Stock upon completion of our acquisition of Coherent, (i) authorize or issue any parity stock and (ii) pay any cash dividend on our common stock (other than ordinary dividends). We also may not, unless BCPE otherwise consents in writing (or if such action is taken with respect to a Permitted Issuance (as defined in the Investment Agreement)), so long as it owns at least 25% of the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock that it held immediately following the issuance and sale of the Series B-2 Preferred Stock upon completion of our acquisition of Coherent, redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire (or make or declare any dividend or distribution in respect of) any junior stock (subject to certain exceptions, including, among other things, ordinary dividends, non-cash dividends or other distributions paid pro rata to all holders of our common stock and, if applicable, holders of Series B Preferred Stock, repurchases of junior stock of up to $100 million on an aggregate annual basis and dividends on junior stock in kind or in the form of other junior securities or securities convertible into or exchange for such junior securities). Moreover, under the terms of the Investment Agreement, following the closing of the initial investment and for so long as BCPE beneficially owns shares of Series B Preferred Stock (or shares of our common stock issued upon the conversion thereof) that represent, in the aggregate and on an as-converted basis, at least 25% of the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock that it held immediately following the completion of the issuance and sale of the Series B-2 Preferred Stock upon completion of our acquisition of Coherent, BCPE will have the right to nominate one designee and to designate one observer to the our board of directors. Circumstances may occur in which the interests of BCPE could conflict with the interests of holders of other outstanding capital stock, including our common stock and our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock.42Reports published by securities or industry analysts, freelance bloggers and credit rating agencies, including projections in those reports that exceed our actual results, could adversely affect our share price and trading volume.Research analysts and freelance bloggers publish their own quarterly projections regarding our operating results. These projections may vary widely from one another and may not accurately predict the results we actually achieve. Our share price may decline if we fail to meet securities research analysts’ projections. Similarly, if one or more of the analysts who cover us change their recommendations regarding our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our share price could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, our share price or trading volume could decline.Regulatory actions may adversely affect the trading price and liquidity of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock.Holders of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock who employ, or seek to employ, a convertible arbitrage strategy with respect to the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock may be adversely impacted by regulatory developments that may limit or restrict such a strategy. The SEC and other regulatory and self-regulatory authorities have implemented various rules and may adopt additional rules in the future that restrict and otherwise regulate short selling, over-the-counter swaps, and security-based swaps, which restrictions and regulations may adversely affect the ability of investors in, or potential purchasers of, the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock to conduct a convertible arbitrage strategy with respect to the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. This could, in turn, adversely affect the trading price and liquidity of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock.Holders of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock have no voting rights with respect to the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, except under limited circumstances.Holders of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock have no voting rights with respect to the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, except with respect to certain amendments to the terms of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, in the case of certain dividend arrearages, in certain other limited circumstances, and except as specifically required by applicable Pennsylvania law or by our amended and restated Articles of Incorporation. Holders of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock have no right to vote for any members of our board of directors, except in the case of certain dividend arrearages.If dividends on any Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock have not been declared and paid for the equivalent of six or more dividend periods, whether or not for consecutive dividend periods, the holders of such Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class with holders of all other series of preferred stock ranking equally with the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and having similar voting rights, will be entitled at our next special or annual meeting of shareholders to vote for the election of a total of two additional members of our board of directors, subject to certain limitations.We depend on our subsidiaries for cash to fund our operations and expenses, including future dividend payments with respect to our outstanding preferred stock.A significant portion of our operations is conducted through our subsidiaries, and our ability to generate cash to meet our debt service obligations or to make future dividend payments with respect to the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and, to the extent we elect to make such payments in cash, our Series B Preferred Stock is highly dependent on the earnings and the receipt of funds from our subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries are separate legal entities that have no obligation to make any funds available to us, whether by dividends, loans, or other payments.43"
1,COHR,COHERENT INC,2021-08-20,"RISK FACTORSThe following are certain risk factors that could affect our business, results of operations, financial position or cash flows. These risk factors should be considered along with the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, because these factors could cause our actual results or financial condition to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. The following discussion is not an all-inclusive listing of risks, although we believe these are the material risks that we face. If any of the following occur, our business, results of operations, financial position, or cash flows could be adversely affected. You should carefully consider these factors, as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, when evaluating an investment in our securities. Risks Relating to Our Business and Our IndustryInvestments in future markets of potential significant growth may not result in the expected return. We continue to make investments in programs with the goal of gaining a greater share of end markets using semiconductor lasers and other components, including those used for 3D sensing and emerging 5G technology. We cannot guarantee that our investments in capital and capabilities will be sufficient. The potential end markets, as well as our ability to gain market share in such markets, may not materialize on the timeline anticipated or at all. We cannot be sure of the end market price, specification, or yield for products incorporating our technologies. Our technologies could fail to fulfill, partially or completely, our target customers’ specifications. We cannot guarantee the end market customers’ acceptance of our technologies. Further, we may be unable to fulfill the terms of our contracts with our target customers, which could result in penalties of a material nature, including damages, loss of market share, and loss of reputation.Our competitive position depends on our ability to develop new products and processes. To meet our strategic objectives, we must develop, manufacture, and market new products and continue to update our existing products and processes to keep pace with market developments to address increasingly sophisticated customer requirements. Our success in developing and selling new and enhanced products and processes depends upon a variety of factors, including strategic product selection, efficient completion of product design and development, timely implementation of manufacturing and assembly processes, effective sales and marketing, and high-quality and successful product performance in the market.The introduction by our competitors of products or processes using new developments that are better or faster than ours could render our products or processes obsolete or unmarketable. We intend to continue to make significant investments in research, development, and engineering to achieve our goals. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new products or enhancements to our existing products and processes in a manner which satisfies customer needs or achieves market acceptance. The failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business and maintain our competitive position and on our results of operations and/or financial condition.A widespread health crises could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.The outbreak of a widespread health crisis, whether global in scope or localized in an area in which we, our customers or our suppliers do business, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and the operations of our suppliers and customers. Potential impacts on our operations include:•significant reductions in demand for one or more of our products or a curtailment to one or more of our product lines caused by, among other things, any temporary inability of our customers to purchase and utilize our products in next-stage manufacturing due to shutdown orders or financial hardship;•workforce constraints triggered by any applicable shutdown orders or stay-at-home polices; •disruptions to our third-party manufacturing and raw materials supply arrangements caused by constraints over our suppliers’ workforce capacity, financial, or operational difficulties;•heightened risk and uncertainty regarding the loss or disruption of essential third-party service providers, including transportation services, contract manufacturing, marketing, and distribution services;•requirements to comply with governmental and regulatory responses such as quarantines, import/export restrictions, price controls, or other governmental or regulatory actions, including closures or other restrictions that limit or close our operating and manufacturing facilities, restrict our workforce’s ability to travel or perform necessary business functions, or otherwise impact our suppliers or customers, which could adversely impact our operating results; and•increased operating expenses and potentially reduced efficiency of operations. In the early stages of the outbreak of the global novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in 2020, we closely monitored the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business, including the impact to our suppliers, customers, and employees, as well as 25the impact to the countries and markets in which we operate. We began focusing intensely on mitigating the adverse impacts of COVID-19 on our foreign and domestic operations, starting by protecting our employees, suppliers, and customers. While we believe that we have been successful in identifying, managing, and mitigating the economic disruption impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on us, we cannot provide any assurance that we similarly will be able to mitigate the impacts of any future widespread health crises, including as a result of any variants of COVID-19. Factors beyond our current knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of any outbreak, as well as any resulting governmental and regulatory actions, could cause any such crisis to have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.Global economic downturns may adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. Current and future conditions in the global economy have an inherent degree of uncertainty. As a result, it is difficult to estimate the level of growth or contraction of the global economy as a whole. It is even more difficult to estimate growth or contraction in various parts, sectors, and regions of the economy, including the industrial, aerospace and defense, optical communications, telecommunications, semiconductor, consumer, and medical and life science markets in which we participate. All aspects of our forecasts depend on estimates of growth or contraction in the markets we serve. Thus, prevailing global economic uncertainties render estimates of future income and expenditures very difficult to make. Global economic downturns may affect industries in which our customers operate. These changes could include decreases in the rate of consumption or use of our customers’ products. Such conditions could have a material adverse effect on demand for our customers’ products and, in turn, on demand for our products. Adverse changes may occur in the future as a result of declining or flat global or regional economic conditions, fluctuations in currency and commodity prices, wavering confidence, capital expenditure reductions, unemployment, decline in stock markets, contraction of credit availability, or other factors affecting economic conditions. For example, factors that may affect our operating results include disruption in the credit and financial markets in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere, adverse effects of slowdowns in the U.S., European, or Chinese economies, reductions or limited growth in consumer spending or consumer credit, global trade tariffs, and other adverse economic conditions that may be specific to the Internet, e-commerce, and payments industries. These changes may negatively affect sales of products and increase exposure to losses from bad debt and commodity prices, the cost and availability of financing, and costs associated with manufacturing and distributing products. Any economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.Some systems that use our products are complex in design, and our products may contain defects that are not detected until deployed, which could increase our costs, reduce our revenues, cause us to lose key customers, or expose us to litigation related to our products. Some systems that use our products are inherently complex in design and require ongoing maintenance. Our customers may discover defects in our products after the products have been fully deployed and operated under peak stress conditions. In addition, some of our products are combined with products from other vendors which may contain defects. Should problems occur, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. If we are unable to correct defects or other problems, we could experience, among other things, loss of customers, increased costs of product returns and warranty expenses, damage to our brand reputation, failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance, diversion of development and engineering resources, or legal action by our customers. The occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.Foreign currency risk may negatively affect our revenues, cost of sales, and operating margins, and could result in foreign exchange losses. We conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most countries in which we operate.  We incur currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a different currency from the currency in which it operates, or holds assets or liabilities in a currency different from its functional currency. Changes in exchange rates can also affect our results of operations when the value of sales and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars. We cannot accurately predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations. Further, given the volatility of exchange rates, we may not be able to effectively manage our currency risks, and any volatility in currency exchange rates may increase the price of our products in local currency to our foreign customers or increase the manufacturing cost of our products, either of which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows, and profitability.Our competitive position may still require significant investments. We continuously monitor the marketplace for strategic opportunities, and our business strategy includes expanding our product lines and markets through both internal product development and acquisitions. Consequently, we expect to continue to consider 26strategic acquisition of businesses, products, or technologies complementary to our business. This may require significant investments of management time and financial resources. If market demand is outside our organic capabilities, if a strategic acquisition is required and we cannot identify one or execute on it, and/or if financial investments that we undertake distract management, do not result in the expected return on investment, expose us to unforeseen liabilities, or jeopardize our ability to comply with our credit facility covenants due to any inability to integrate the business, adjust to operating a larger and more complex organization, adapt to additional political and other requirements associated with the acquired business, retain staff, or work with customers, we could suffer a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.We may be unable to successfully implement our acquisitions strategy or integrate acquired companies and personnel with existing operations. We have in the past acquired several companies, including the completion of our acquisition of Finisar Corporation (“Finisar”) in 2019. We may continue to expand and diversify our operations with additional acquisitions, such as our pending acquisition of Coherent, Inc. (“Coherent”). We may be unable to identify or complete prospective acquisitions for many reasons, including increasing competition from other potential acquirers, the effects of consolidation in our industries, and potentially high valuations of acquisition candidates. In addition, applicable antitrust laws and other regulations may limit our ability to acquire targets or force us to divest an acquired business line. If we are unable to identify suitable targets or complete acquisitions, our growth prospects may suffer, and we may not be able to realize sufficient scale and technological advantages to compete effectively in all markets. To the extent that we complete acquisitions, we may be unsuccessful in integrating acquired companies or product lines with existing operations, or the integration may be more difficult or more costly than anticipated. Some of the risks that may affect our ability to integrate or realize anticipated benefits from acquired companies, businesses, or assets include those associated with: •unexpected losses of key employees of the acquired company; •conforming the acquired company’s standards, processes, procedures, and controls with our operations, including integrating enterprise resource planning systems and other key business applications; •coordinating new product and process development; •increasing complexity from combining operations; •increasing the scope, geographic diversity, and complexity of our operations; •difficulties in consolidating facilities and transferring processes and know-how; and •diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns. •In connection with acquisitions, we may: ◦use a signification portion of our available cash; ◦issue equity securities, which would dilute current shareholders’ percentage ownership; ◦incur significant debt; ◦incur or assume contingent liabilities, known or unknown, including potential lawsuits, infringement actions, or similar liabilities; ◦incur impairment charges related to goodwill or other intangibles; and ◦face antitrust or other regulatory inquiries or actions.In addition, the market prices of our outstanding securities could be adversely affected if the effect of any acquisitions on our consolidated financial results is dilutive or is below the market’s or financial analysts’ expectations, or if there are unanticipated changes in the business or financial performance of the acquired or combined company. Any failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses may disrupt our business and adversely impact our business, results of operations, or financial condition.Although we expect that our acquisitions will result in cost savings, synergies, and other benefits, we may not realize those benefits, or be able to retain those benefits even if realized.The success of our acquisitions will depend in large part on our success in integrating the acquired operations, strategies, technologies, and personnel. We may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of an acquisition if the integration process takes longer than expected or is more costly than expected. If we fail to meet the challenges involved in successfully integrating any acquired operations or to otherwise realize any of the anticipated benefits of an acquisition, including any expected cost savings and synergies, our operations could be impaired. In addition, the overall integration of an acquired business can be a time-consuming and expensive process that, without proper planning and effective and timely implementation, could significantly disrupt our business.Potential difficulties that we may encounter in the integration process include:27•the integration of management teams, strategies, technologies and operations, products, and services;•the disruption of ongoing businesses and distraction of their respective management teams from ongoing business concerns;•the retention of, and possible decrease in business from, existing customers•the creation of uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies, and information systems; •the reduction of the costs associated with combined operations;•the integration of corporate cultures and maintenance of employee morale;•the retention of key employees; and•potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquired business.The anticipated cost savings, synergies, and other benefits of any acquisition typically assume a successful integration of the acquired business and are based on projections and other assumptions, which are inherently uncertain. Even if integration is successful, anticipated cost savings, synergies, and other benefits may not be achieved.Our future success depends on continued international sales, and our global operations are complex and present multiple challenges to manage. We anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. The failure to maintain our current volume of international sales could materially affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and/or cash flows. We manufacture products in Australia, China, Germany, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Vietnam, and through a contract manufacturer in Thailand. We also maintain direct sales offices in Belgium, Canada, China, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom. Our operations vary by location and are influenced on a location-by-location basis by local customs, languages, and work practices, as well as different local weather conditions, management styles, and education systems. In addition, multiple complex issues may arise concurrently in different countries, potentially hampering our ability to respond in an effective and timely manner. Any inability to respond in an effective and timely manner to issues in our global operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.We are subject to complex and rapidly changing import and export regulations which could limit our sales and decrease our profitability. We are subject to the passage of and changes in the interpretation of regulation by U.S. government entities at the federal, state, and local levels and by non-U.S. agencies, including, but not limited to, the following: •We are required to comply with import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our ability to enter into or complete transactions with certain customers, business partners, and other persons. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services, and technologies. We may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item, and granting of a required license cannot be assured. Compliance with the import laws that apply to our businesses may restrict our access to, and may increase the cost of obtaining, certain products and could interrupt our supply of imported inventory.•Exported technologies necessary to develop and manufacture certain products are subject to U.S. export control laws and similar laws of other jurisdictions. We may be subject to adverse regulatory consequences, including government oversight of facilities and export transactions, monetary penalties, and other sanctions for violations of these laws. In certain instances, these regulations may prohibit us from developing or manufacturing certain of our products for specific applications outside the United States. Failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary, and nonmonetary penalties; disruptions to our business; limitations on our ability to import and export products and services; and damage to our reputation.Changes in trade policies, such as increased import duties, could increase the costs of goods imported into the United States or China. In March 2018, President Trump announced new steel and aluminum tariffs. Then, in July 2018, the United States imposed increased tariffs on products of Chinese origin, and China responded by increasing tariffs on U.S.-origin goods. On the export side, denial orders and placing companies on the U.S. entity list could decrease our access to customers and markets and materially impact our revenues in the aggregate. In April 2018, for example, the U.S. Department of Commerce issued a denial 28order against two companies in the telecommunications market. In 2019 and 2020, the U.S. Department of Commerce placed a number of entities, including Huawei, on the U.S. Entity List. If we cannot obtain relief from, or take other action to mitigate the impact of, these additional duties and restrictions and duties, our business and profits may be materially and adversely affected. Further changes in the trade policy of the United States or of other countries in which we do cross-border business, or additional sanctions, could result in retaliatory actions by other countries that could materially and negatively impact the volume of economic activity in the United States or globally, which, in turn, may decrease our access to customers and markets, reduce our revenues, and increase our operating costs. Our association with customers that are or become subject to U.S. regulatory scrutiny or export restrictions could negatively impact our business and create instability in our operations. Governmental actions such as these could subject us to actual or perceived reputational harm among current or prospective investors, suppliers or customers, customers of our customers, other parties doing business with us, or the general public. Any such reputational harm could result in the loss of investors, suppliers, or customers, which could harm our business, financial condition, operating results, or prospects.Exports of certain of our products are subject to export controls imposed by the U.S. government and administered by the U.S. Departments of State and Commerce. In certain instances, these regulations may require pre-shipment authorization from the administering department. For products subject to the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), administered by the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security, the requirement for a license is dependent on the type and end use of the product, the final destination, the identity of the end user, and whether a license exception might apply. Virtually all exports of products subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), administered by the Department of State’s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, require a license. Certain of our products are subject to EAR controls. Additionally, certain other products that we sell, including certain products developed with government funding, are subject to ITAR. Products developed and manufactured in our foreign locations are subject to export controls of the applicable foreign nation. Given the current global political climate, obtaining export licenses can be difficult and time-consuming. Failure to obtain export licenses for these shipments, or having one or more of our customers be restricted from receiving exports from us, could significantly reduce our revenue and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Compliance with regulations of the United States and other governments also subjects us to additional fees and costs. The absence of comparable restrictions on competitors in other countries may adversely affect our competitive position. Any inability to access financial markets from time to time to raise required capital, finance our working capital requirements or our acquisition strategies, or otherwise support our liquidity needs could negatively impact our ability to finance our operations, meet certain obligations, or implement our growth strategy. We from time to time borrow under our existing credit facility or use proceeds from sales of our securities to fund portions of our operations, including working capital investments and financing of our acquisition strategies. In the past, market disruptions experienced in the United States and abroad have materially impacted liquidity in the credit and debt markets, making financing terms for borrowers less attractive and, in certain cases, have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of financing. Uncertainty in the financial markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing or to refinance our existing debt arrangements on favorable terms or at all, which could negatively affect our ability to fund current and future expansion as well as future acquisitions and development. These disruptions may include turmoil in the financial services industry, volatility in the markets where our outstanding securities trade, and changes in general economic conditions in the areas where we do business. If we are unable to access funds at competitive rates, or if our short-term or long-term borrowing costs increase, our ability to finance our operations, meet our short-term obligations, and implement our operating strategies could be adversely affected. In the future, we may be required to raise additional capital through public or private financing or other arrangements. Such financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all, and our failure to raise capital when needed could harm our business and prospects. Additional equity financing may be dilutive to the holders of our outstanding capital stock, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to undertake certain activities that we otherwise would find to be desirable. Further, debt service obligations associated with any debt financing could reduce our profitability. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to grow our business or respond to competitive pressures.We may not be able to settle conversions of our convertible senior notes in cash or repurchase the notes in accordance with their terms. Holders of our outstanding 0.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2022 (the “2022 Notes”) and the 0.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2036 issued by Finisar (the “2036 Notes”) have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their convertible notes for cash upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the respective indentures governing such notes) at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the convertible notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest. Holders of the 2036 Notes also have the right to require Finisar to repurchase all or a portion of their 2036 Notes for cash on certain specified dates at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2036 Notes to be 29repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest. The next such repurchase date for the 2036 Notes is December 15, 2021. In addition, upon conversion of such convertible notes, we will be required to make cash payments in respect of such convertible notes being converted.  However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of surrendered convertible notes or pay cash with respect to convertible notes being converted. In addition, our ability to repurchase or to pay cash upon conversion of our convertible notes may be limited by law, regulatory authority, or agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase convertible notes at a time when the repurchase is required or to pay any cash upon conversion of the convertible notes as required would constitute a default under the applicable indenture. A default under the applicable indenture or the fundamental change itself also could lead to a default under agreements governing our existing credit facility or any of our other current or future indebtedness. If the payment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the convertible notes or to pay cash upon conversion of any such convertible notes.Our current credit agreement restricts our operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions regarding our business.Our amended and restated credit agreement, dated as of September 24, 2019, by and among us, Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and an L/C Issuer, and the other lenders party thereto (the “Credit Agreement”) contains a number of restrictive covenants that may impose operating and financial restrictions on us and limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interest, including restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness, grant liens, undergo certain fundamental changes, dispose of assets, make certain investments, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, and make certain restricted payments, in each case subject to limitations and exceptions set forth in the Credit Agreement.The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default that include, among other things, certain payment defaults, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to other indebtedness, change of control defaults, judgment defaults, and bankruptcy and insolvency defaults. Such events of default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, and financial results. Furthermore, if we are unable to repay the amounts due and payable under the Credit Agreement, those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness, which could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation. In the event that our lenders accelerated the repayment of the borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. Any acceleration of amounts due under the Credit Agreement would likely have a material adverse effect on us. As a result of these restrictions, we may be limited in how we conduct business, unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns, or unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.We may fail to accurately estimate the size and growth of our markets and our customers’ demands. We make significant decisions based on our estimates of customer requirements. We use our estimates to determine the levels of business we seek and accept, production schedules, personnel needs, and other resource requirements.Customers may require rapid increases in production on short notice. We may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or allocate sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet such increases in demand. Rapid customer ramp-up and significant increases in demand may strain our resources or negatively affect our margins. Inability to satisfy customer demand in a timely manner may harm our reputation, reduce our other opportunities, damage our relationships with customers, reduce revenue growth, and/or cause us to incur contractual penalties. Alternatively, downturns in the industries in which we compete may cause our customers to significantly reduce their demand. With respect to orders we initiate with our suppliers to address anticipated demand from our customers, certain suppliers may have required noncancellable purchase commitments or advance payments from us, and those obligations and commitments could reduce our ability to adjust our inventory or expense levels to reflect declining market demands. Unexpected declines in customer demands can result in excess or obsolete inventory and additional charges. Because certain of our sales, research and development, and internal manufacturing overhead expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in customer demand likely would decrease our gross margins and operating income.We may encounter increased competition, and we may fail to accurately estimate our competitors’ or our customers’ willingness and capability to backward integrate into our competencies and thereby displace us. We may encounter substantial competition from other companies in the same market, including established companies with significant resources. Some of our competitors may have financial, technical, marketing, or other capabilities that are more extensive than ours. They may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and other competitive pressures. We may not be able to compete successfully against our present or future competitors. Our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.30There are limitations on the protection of our intellectual property, and we may from time to time be involved in costly intellectual property litigation or indemnification. We rely on a combination of trade secret, patent, copyright, and trademark laws, combined with employee confidentiality, noncompetition, and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance that the steps we take will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or intellectual property. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future. Asserting our intellectual property rights or defending against third-party claims could involve substantial expense. In the event that a third party were successful in a claim that one of our processes infringed its proprietary rights, we could be required to pay substantial damages or royalties, or spend substantial amounts in order to obtain a license or modify processes so that they no longer infringe such proprietary rights. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.The design, processes, and specialized equipment utilized in our engineered materials, advanced components, and subsystems are innovative, complex, and difficult to duplicate. However, there can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent similar technology, or that all aspects of our proprietary technology will be protected. Others have obtained patents covering a variety of materials, devices, equipment, configurations, and processes, and others could obtain patents covering technology similar to ours. We may be required to obtain licenses under such patents, and there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain such licenses, if required, on commercially reasonable terms, or that claims regarding rights to technology will not be asserted that may adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, our research and development contracts with agencies of the U.S. government present a risk that project-specific technology could be disclosed to competitors as contract reporting requirements are fulfilled. We also enter into development projects from time to time that might result in intellectual property developed during a project that is assigned to the other party without us retaining rights to that intellectual property or is jointly owned with the other party.A significant portion of our business is dependent on cyclical industries. Our business is dependent on the demand for products produced by end-users of industrial lasers, optical communication products, components for semiconductor capital equipment, and components for 3D sensing. Many of these end-users are in industries that have historically experienced a highly cyclical demand for their products. As a result, demand for our products is subject to these cyclical fluctuations. Fluctuations in demand could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.Our global operations are subject to complex legal and regulatory requirements. We manufacture products in Australia, China, Germany, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Vietnam, and through a contract manufacturer in Thailand. We also maintain direct sales offices in Belgium, Canada, China, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom. Operations inside and outside of the United States are subject to many legal and regulatory requirements, some of which are not aligned with others. These include tariffs, quotas, taxes and other market barriers, restrictions on the export or import of technology, potentially limited intellectual property protection, import and export requirements and restrictions, anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, foreign investment rules and regulations, data privacy requirements, competition laws, employment and labor laws, pensions and social insurance, and environmental health and safety laws and regulations. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be onerous and expensive, and requirements differ among jurisdictions. New laws, changes in existing laws, and abrogation of local regulations by national laws may result in significant uncertainties in how they will be interpreted and enforced. Failure to comply with any of these foreign laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.Changes in laws and regulations governing data privacy and data protection could have a material adverse impact on our business. We are subject to many data privacy, data protection, and data breach notification laws, including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which became effective in 2018. While we have taken measures to assess the requirements of, and to comply with, the GDPR, as well as new and existing data-related laws and regulations of other jurisdictions, these measures may be challenged, including by authorities that regulate data-related compliance. We could incur significant expense in facilitating and responding to investigations, and if the measures we have taken prove to be inadequate, we could face fines, penalties, or damages, and incur reputational harm, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.31Data breach incidents and breakdowns of information and communication technologies could disrupt our operations and impact our financial results.In the course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property (both our own and that of our customers), as well as proprietary business information. We could be subject to service outages or breaches of security systems which may result in disruption, unauthorized access, misappropriation, or corruption of this information. Security breaches of our network or data, including physical or electronic break-ins, vendor service outages, computer viruses, attacks by hackers or similar breaches can create system disruptions, shutdowns, and unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. If we are unable to prevent or contain such security or privacy breaches, our operations could be disrupted or we could suffer legal claims, loss of reputation, financial loss, property damage, or regulatory penalties.We have entered into supply agreements that commit us to supply products on specified terms. We have supply agreements with some customers that require us to supply products and allocate sufficient capacity to make these products. We have also agreed to pricing schedules and methodologies that could result in penalties if we fail to meet development, supply, capacity, and quality commitments. Failure to do so may cause us to be unable to generate the amount of revenue or the level of profitability we expect from these arrangements. Our ability to realize a profit under some of these agreements will be subject to the level of customer demand, the cost of maintaining facilities and manufacturing capacity, and supply chain capability. If we fail to fulfill our commitments under these supply agreements, our business, after using all remedies available, financial conditions, and results of operations may suffer a material adverse effect.We depend on highly complex manufacturing processes that require feeder materials, components, and products from limited sources of supply. Our operations are dependent upon a supply chain of difficult-to-make or difficult-to-refine products and materials. Some of our product inflow is subject to yield reductions from growth or fabrication losses, and thus the quantities we may receive are not consistently predictable. Customers may also change a specification for a product that our suppliers cannot meet. We also make products of which we are one of the world’s largest suppliers. We use high-quality, optical-grade ZnSe in the production of many of our IR optical products. We are a leading producer of ZnSe for our internal use and for external sale. The production of ZnSe is a complex process requiring a highly controlled environment. A number of factors, including defective or contaminated materials, could adversely affect our ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields of high-quality ZnSe. Lack of adequate availability of high-quality ZnSe could have a material adverse effect upon our business. There can be no assurance that we will not experience manufacturing yield inefficiencies that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. We produce hydrogen selenide gas, which is used in our production of ZnSe. There are risks inherent in the production and handling of such material. Our lack of proper handling of hydrogen selenide could require us to curtail our production of the gas. Our potential inability to internally produce hydrogen selenide could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. In addition, we produce and use other high-purity and relatively uncommon materials and compounds to manufacture our products, including, but not limited to, ZnS, GaAs, yttrium aluminum garnet, yttrium lithium fluoride, calcium fluoride, germanium, selenium, telluride, Bi2Te3, and SiC. A significant failure of our internal production processes or our suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of these necessary materials on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.Increases in commodity prices may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of increases in commodity prices. Our businesses purchase, produce, and sell high-purity selenium and other raw materials based upon quoted market prices from minor metal exchanges. The negative impact from increases in commodity prices might not be recovered through our product sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings and financial condition.We use and generate potentially hazardous substances that are subject to stringent environmental regulations. Hazardous substances used or generated in some of our research and manufacturing facilities are subject to stringent environmental regulation. We believe that our handling of such substances is in material compliance with applicable environmental, safety, and health regulations at each operating location. We invest substantially in proper personal protective equipment and process controls, including monitoring and specialized training, to minimize risks to employees, surrounding communities, and the environment that could result from the presence and handling of such hazardous substances. When exposure problems or potential exposure problems have been uncovered, corrective actions have been implemented, and re-occurrence has been minimal or nonexistent. 32We have in place an emergency response plans with respect to our generation and use of the hazardous substances hydrogen selenide, hydrogen sulfide, arsine, and phosphine. Special attention has been given to all procedures pertaining to these gaseous materials to minimize the chance of its accidental release into the atmosphere. With respect to the manufacturing, use, storage, and disposal of the low-level radioactive material thorium fluoride, our facilities and procedures have been inspected and licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Thorium-bearing by-products are collected and shipped as solid waste to a government-approved low-level radioactive waste disposal site in Clive, Utah. The generation, use, collection, storage, and disposal of all other hazardous by-products, such as suspended solids containing heavy metals or airborne particulates, are believed by us to be in material compliance with regulations. We believe that we have obtained all of the permits and licenses required for operation of our business. Although we do not know of any material environmental, safety, or health problems in our properties, processes, or products, there can be no assurance that problems will not develop in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.We have a substantial amount of debt, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations and prevent us from fulfilling our debt-related obligations.As of June 30, 2021, we had approximately $1.4 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis. Our indebtedness could have important consequences for us, including:•making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt, or to our trade or other creditors;•increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions;•limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions, particularly when the availability of financing in the capital markets is limited;•requiring us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing or on our variable-rate indebtedness if interest rates rise;•requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations and the proceeds of any capital markets offerings or loan borrowings for the payment of interest on our debt and reducing our ability to use our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and general corporate requirements;•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate; and•placing us at a competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors. We may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, together with any future borrowings, to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, on or before its maturity. We may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, we may incur additional indebtedness in order to finance our operations, fund acquisitions, or repay existing indebtedness. If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, pursuing sales of additional debt or equity securities, or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments, or alliances. Any such actions, if necessary, may not be able to be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or on terms that would be advantageous to our stockholders, or on terms that would not require us to breach the terms and conditions of our existing or future debt agreements.Unfavorable changes in tax rates, tax liabilities, or tax accounting rules could negatively affect future results. As a global company, we are subject to taxation in the United States and various other countries and jurisdictions. As such, we must exercise a level of judgment in determining our worldwide tax liabilities. Our future tax rates could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in countries with differing tax rates or changes in tax laws. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significantly adverse impact on our effective tax rate. The enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) in December 2017 significantly affected U.S. tax law by changing how the United States imposes tax on multinational corporations. The U.S. Department of Treasury has broad authority under the Tax Act to issue regulations and interpretive guidance. We have applied available guidance to estimate our tax obligations, but new guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department may cause us to make adjustments to our tax estimates in future periods. In addition, we are subject to regular examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to 33determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provision and accruals, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operation, or financial condition.Natural disasters or other global or regional catastrophic events could disrupt our operations, give rise to substantial environmental hazards, and adversely affect our results. We may be exposed to business interruptions due to extreme weather caused by climate change and deforestation, force majeure catastrophes, natural disaster, pandemic, terrorism, or acts of war that are beyond our control. Disruptions to our facilities or systems, or to those of our key suppliers, could also interrupt operational processes and adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products and provide services and support to our customers. As a result, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.Our success depends on our ability to attract, retain, and develop key personnel and requires continued good relations with our employees.We are highly dependent upon the experience and continuing services of certain scientists, engineers, production, and management personnel. Competition for the services of these personnel is intense. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain or attract the personnel necessary for our success. The loss of the services of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.We contract with a number of large end-user service providers and product companies that have considerable bargaining power, which may require us to agree to terms and conditions that could have an adverse effect on our business or ability to recognize revenues. Large end-user service providers and product companies comprise a significant portion of our customer base. These customers generally have greater purchasing power than smaller entities and, accordingly, often request and receive more favorable terms from suppliers, including us. As we seek to expand our sales to existing customers and acquire new customers, we may be required to agree to terms and conditions that are favorable to our customers and that may affect the timing of our ability to recognize revenue, increase our costs, and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Furthermore, large customers have increased buying power and ability to require onerous terms in our contracts with them, including pricing, warranties, and indemnification terms. If we are unable to satisfy the terms of these contracts, it could result in liabilities of a material nature, including litigation, damages, additional costs, loss of market share, and loss of reputation. Additionally, the terms these large customers require, such as most-favored customer or exclusivity provisions, may impact our ability to do business with other customers and generate revenues from such customers. We may be adversely affected by climate change regulations. In many of the countries in which we operate, government bodies are increasingly enacting legislation and regulations in response to potential impacts of climate change. These laws and regulations may be mandatory. They have the potential to impact our operations directly or indirectly as a result of required compliance by our customers or our supply chain. Inconsistency of regulations may also affect the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations. Assessments of the potential impact of future climate change legislation, regulation, and international treaties and accords are uncertain, given the wide scope of potential regulatory change in countries in which we operate. We may incur increased capital expenditures resulting from required compliance with revised or new legislation or regulations, added costs to purchase raw materials, lower profits from sales of our products, allowances or credits under a “cap and trade” system, increased insurance premiums and deductibles as new actuarial tables are developed to reshape coverage, changes in competitive position relative to industry peers, changes to profit or loss arising from increased or decreased demand for goods produced by us, or changes in costs of goods sold.We depend on large purchases from a few significant customers, and any loss, cancellation, reduction, or delay in purchases by these customers could harm our business. A small number of customers have consistently accounted for a significant portion of our revenues, although none individually represent greater than 10% of total revenues. Our success will depend on our continued ability to develop and manage relationships with our major customers. Although we are attempting to expand our customer base, we expect that significant customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future. We may not be able to offset any decline in revenues from our existing major customers with revenues from new customers, and our quarterly results may be volatile because we are dependent on large orders from these customers that may be reduced, delayed, or cancelled. The markets in which we have historically sold our optical subsystems and components products are dominated by a relatively small number of systems manufacturers, thereby limiting the number of our potential customers. 34Our dependence on large orders from a relatively small number of customers makes our relationship with each customer critically important to our business. We cannot ensure that we will be able to retain our major customers, attract additional customers, or that our customers will be successful in selling their products that incorporate our products. In addition, governmental trade action or economic sanctions may limit or preclude our ability to do business with certain customers. We have in the past experienced delays and reductions in orders from some of our major customers. In addition, our customers have in the past sought price concessions from us, and we expect that they will continue to do so in the future. Expense reduction measures that we have implemented over the past several years, and additional action we are taking to reduce costs, may adversely affect our ability to introduce new and improved products, which may, in turn, adversely affect our relationships with some of our key customers. Further, some of our customers may in the future shift their purchases of products from us to our competitors or to joint ventures between these customers and our competitors, or may in certain circumstances produce competitive products themselves. The loss of one or more of our major customers, any reduction or delay in sales to these customers, our inability to successfully develop relationships with additional customers, or future price concessions that we may make could significantly harm our business. The manufacturing of our products may be adversely affected if we are unable to manufacture certain products in our manufacturing facilities. We manufacture some of the components that we incorporate into our subsystem products; in other cases, we provide components to contract manufacturers to produce finished goods. For some of the components and finished goods, we are the sole manufacturer. Our manufacturing processes are highly complex, and issues are often difficult to detect and correct. From time to time we have experienced problems achieving acceptable yields in our manufacturing facilities, resulting in delays in the availability of our products. In addition, if we experience problems with our manufacturing facilities, it would be costly and require a long period of time to move the manufacture of these components and finished good products to a different facility or contract manufacturer, which could result in interruptions in supply and would likely materially impact our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, for a variety of reasons, including changes in circumstances at our contract manufacturers or our own business strategies, we may voluntarily, or be required to, transfer the manufacturing of certain products to other manufacturing sites. Changes in manufacturing processes are often required due to changes in product specifications, changing customer needs, and the introduction of new products. These changes may reduce manufacturing yields at our contract manufacturers and at our own manufacturing facilities, resulting in reduced margins on those products. In addition, many of our products are sourced from suppliers based outside of the United States, primarily in Asia. Uncertainty with respect to tax and trade policies, tariffs, and government regulations affecting trade between the United States and other countries has recently increased. Major developments in tax policy or trade relations, such as the imposition of tariffs on imported products, could increase our product and product-related costs or require us to seek alternative suppliers, either of which could result in decreased sales or increased product and product-related costs. Failure to accurately forecast our revenues could result in additional charges for obsolete or excess inventories or noncancellable purchase commitments. We base many of our operating decisions, and enter into purchase commitments, on the basis of anticipated revenue trends that are highly unpredictable. Some of our purchase commitments are not cancellable, and in some cases we are required to recognize a charge representing an amount of material or capital equipment purchased or ordered that exceeds our actual requirements. Should revenues in future periods fall substantially below our expectations, or should we fail to accurately forecast changes in demand mix, we could be required to record substantial charges for obsolete or excess inventories or noncancellable purchase commitments.If we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired. As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (“the Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), and Nasdaq listing requirements. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources, including accounting-related costs and significant management oversight. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement, could delay the reporting of our financial results or cause us to be subject to investigations, enforcement actions by regulatory agencies, stockholder lawsuits, or other adverse actions requiring us to incur defense costs or pay fines, settlements, or judgments. Any such failures or difficulties could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 35Risks Relating to Our Pending Acquisition of CoherentThe market prices of our securities after completion of our pending acquisition of Coherent may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the markets for our securities or securities issued by Coherent. Our business differs from that of Coherent. Accordingly, our results of operations and the market price of our securities after the completion of our pending acquisition of Coherent may be affected by factors different from those currently affecting the independent results of operations of each company. In addition, the issuance of shares of our common stock as part of the merger consideration payable in connection with the acquisition could on its own have the effect of depressing the market prices for our securities, including our common stock and our 6.00% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (“Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock”). Further, many Coherent stockholders may decide not to hold the shares of our common stock that they receive as merger consideration. Other Coherent stockholders, such as funds with limitations on their permitted holdings of stock in individual issuers, may be required to sell the shares of our common stock that they receive as merger consideration. Any such sales of our common stock could have the effect of depressing the market prices for our securities There can be no assurance that we will be able to secure the funds necessary to pay the cash portion of the merger consideration payable in our acquisition of Coherent, in a timely manner or at all. We intend to finance part of the cash portion of the merger consideration payable in our acquisition of Coherent with the proceeds of debt financing. To this end, we have entered into a debt commitment letter (the “Debt Commitment Letter”) containing commitments for a senior secured term loan “A” facility in an aggregate principal amount of $850 million, a senior secured term loan “B” facility in an aggregate principal amount of $2,800 million, a senior secured revolving credit facility in an aggregate principal amount of $350 million and a senior unsecured bridge loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of $1,125 million. We have not entered into any definitive agreement for this debt financing or other financing arrangements in lieu thereof, and the obligation of the lender to provide the debt financing under the Debt Commitment Letter is subject to a number of customary conditions. There is a risk that these conditions will not be satisfied and the debt financing may not be available when required. We also intend to finance part of the cash portion of the merger consideration with the proceeds of equity investments made by BCPE Watson (DE) SPV, LP, an affiliate of Bain Capital Private Equity, LP (“BCPE”). To this end, on March 30, 2021, we entered into an amended and restated investment agreement (the “Investment Agreement”) with BCPE. On March 31, 2021, we issued and sold 75,000 shares of a new Series B-1 Convertible Preferred Stock, no par value (“Series B-1 Preferred Stock”), to BCPE for an aggregate purchase price of $750 million. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Investment Agreement, we and BCPE also have agreed that we will issue and sell to BCPE, immediately prior to the closing of our acquisition of Coherent, an aggregate of 140,000 shares of a new Series B-2 Convertible Preferred Stock, no par value (“Series B-2 Preferred Stock” and together with Series B-1 Preferred Stock, the “Series B Preferred Stock”), for an aggregate purchase price of $1.4 billion. However, the issuance and sale of the Series B-2 Preferred Stock to BCPE is subject to a number of customary conditions, and there can be no assurance that this part of the equity financing will be completed. In the event that the debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or the remaining investment contemplated by the Investment Agreement is not consummated, there is a risk that alternate financing may not be available on acceptable terms, in a timely manner or at all. Although our obligation to consummate our acquisition of Coherent is not conditioned upon the consummation of either of the debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or the remaining investment contemplated by the Investment Agreement, if we are unable to complete either of those financing transactions, the completion of our acquisition of Coherent may be delayed or not completed, in which case we would be in breach of our obligations under the merger agreement containing the terms of the acquisition.The agreements that will govern indebtedness to be incurred or assumed in connection with our acquisition of Coherent are expected to contain various covenants that will impose restrictions on that may affect our ability to operate our businesses. The agreements that will govern indebtedness to be incurred or assumed in connection with our acquisition of Coherent, including pursuant to the related debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, are expected to contain various affirmative and negative covenants that will, subject to certain significant exceptions, restrict our ability to, among other things, have liens on our property, incur additional indebtedness, enter into sale and lease-back transactions, make loans, advances or other investments, make non-ordinary course asset sales, declare or pay dividends or make other distributions with respect to equity interests, and/or merge or consolidate with any other person or sell or convey certain of our assets to any one person, among other things. In addition, the definitive documentation governing certain of the facilities is expected to contain financial maintenance covenants that will require us to maintain a certain leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter. Our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. Failure to comply with 36these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could accelerate our repayment obligations under the applicable definitive documentation or under other debt agreements. The significant additional indebtedness that we will incur in connection with our acquisition of Coherent could adversely affect us, including by decreasing our business flexibility, increasing our interest expense and causing our credit ratings to be downgraded. As of June 30, 2021, we had consolidated indebtedness of approximately $1.4 billion. Our pro forma consolidated indebtedness as of June 30, 2021, after giving effect to our acquisition of Coherent and the anticipated incurrence and extinguishment of indebtedness in connection therewith, would have been approximately $5.1 billion. We will have substantially increased indebtedness following completion of the acquisition in comparison to what we have had on a recent historical basis, which could have the effect, among other things, of causing or accentuating the consequences described above under “We have a substantial amount of debt, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations and prevent us from fulfilling our debt-related obligations.”In addition, our credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and, accordingly, our cost of capital. Our ratings reflect each rating organization’s opinion of our financial strength, operating performance, and ability to meet our debt obligations. In connection with the anticipated debt financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter, we expect that we will seek ratings of our indebtedness from leading rating organizations. There can be no assurance that we will achieve or maintain any particular rating in the future. In addition, there can be no assurance that the credit ratings of our existing debt will not be subject to a downgrade below investment grade. If a ratings downgrade were to occur or if we fail to maintain an investment grade rating, we could experience higher borrowing costs in the future and more restrictive debt covenants which could reduce profitability and diminish operational flexibility. Integrating Coherent may be more difficult, costly or time-consuming than expected, and we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisition, including our expected financial and operating performance following the consummation of the acquisition. The success of our acquisition of Coherent will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings. To do so, we must successfully integrate Coherent in a manner that permits those benefits and cost savings to be realized. Our ability to successfully manage this expanded business will depend, in part, upon our ability to implement an effective integration of the two companies and manage a combined business with significantly larger size and scope with the associated increased costs and complexity. If we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, or are not able to achieve these objectives on a timely basis, the anticipated benefits may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected. In addition, the actual cost savings could be less than anticipated. We and Coherent have operated and, until the completion of the acquisition, must continue to operate independently. It is possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of each company’s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the companies’ ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, suppliers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the transaction. Integration efforts between the two companies also may divert management attention and resources. These integration matters could have an adverse effect on each company during this transition period and on us for an undetermined period after completion of the acquisition. All projections regarding the combined company’s business are, by their nature, estimates which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Business and financial measures of the combined company, including revenue, free cash flow, synergies and dividend yield, are uncertain and subject to change based on changes in assumptions underlying such measures or other changes in circumstances, many of which may be outside of our or Coherent’s control. We and Coherent may have difficulty attracting, motivating and retaining executives and other employees in light of the pending acquisition. Uncertainty about the effect of the pending acquisition on our and Coherent’s respective employees may have an adverse effect on us and Coherent. This uncertainty may impair our and Coherent’s ability to attract, retain and motivate personnel both before and after completion of the acquisition. We and Coherent are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of our respective officers and other key employees to execute our business plans. The success of the acquisition will depend in part on our ability to retain the talents and dedication of key employees currently employed by Coherent. Employee retention may be particularly challenging during the pendency of the acquisition, as employees may feel uncertain about their future roles with us after completion of the acquisition. In addition, we and Coherent may have to provide additional compensation in order to retain employees. If key employees terminate their employment with us or Coherent while the acquisition is pending, or with us after completion of the acquisition, our business activities may be adversely affected and our management’s attention may be diverted from successfully integrating Coherent to hiring suitable replacements, all of which may cause our business to suffer. In addition, we and Coherent may not be able to locate or retain suitable replacements for any key employees who leave either company. 37Accordingly, no assurance can be given that we will be able to attract or retain key employees following the completion of the acquisition to the same extent that we or Coherent have been able to attract or retain employees in the past. Regulatory approvals may not be received, may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on us following the completion of the acquisition. Before the acquisition may be completed, certain waiting periods must expire or terminate and applicable approvals must be obtained under certain antitrust, competition and foreign investment laws and regulations. In deciding whether to grant regulatory clearances and approvals, the relevant governmental entities may consider, among other things, the effect of the transaction on competition within their relevant jurisdiction. The terms and conditions of the approvals that are granted may impose requirements, limitations or costs or place restrictions on the conduct of our business. There can be no assurance that regulators will not impose conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions and that such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions will not have the effect of delaying completion of the acquisition or imposing additional material costs on or materially limiting our revenues following the completion of the acquisition. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that any such conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions will not result in the delay or abandonment of the transaction. Our pending acquisition of Coherent is subject to conditions, including certain conditions that may not be satisfied, and may not be completed on a timely basis, or at all. Failure to complete the acquisition could have material and adverse effects on us. Our acquisition of Coherent is subject to a number of conditions, which make the completion and timing of the acquisition uncertain. In addition, the governing merger agreement may be terminated in certain circumstances. If the transaction is not completed on a timely basis or at all, our ongoing business may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the acquisition, we will be subject to a number of risks, including the following: •we will be required to pay certain costs relating to the transaction, whether or not the transaction is completed, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor and printing fees;•under the merger agreement, we are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to completing the transaction, which may adversely affect our ability to execute certain of our business strategies;•time and resources committed by our management team to matters relating to the transaction could otherwise have been devoted to pursuing other beneficial opportunities;•the market price of our common stock could decline to the extent that the current market prices reflect a market assumption that the transaction will be completed; and•depending on the circumstances in which the merger agreement is terminated, we may be required to pay a termination fee of $500.0 million, which may make it more difficult for us to pursue alternatives to the acquisition of Coherent.In addition, if the transaction is not completed, we may experience negative reactions from financial markets and from our customers and employees. We could also be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the transaction or to enforcement proceedings commenced against us to perform our obligations under the governing merger agreement. If the acquisition is not completed, we cannot assure that the risks described above will not materialize and will not adversely affect our business or financial results or the market price of our securities. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant transaction-related costs in connection with our pending acquisition of Coherent. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, substantial expenses in connection with the negotiation and completion of our pending acquisition of Coherent, as well as the costs and expenses of filing, printing and mailing a joint proxy statement/prospectus and various fees paid or to be paid to the SEC and other regulatory agencies in connection with the transaction. These fees and costs have been, and will continue to be, significant. In addition, we will incur significant costs with respect to the expected financing transactions relating to the cash portion of the merger consideration. If the transaction is not completed, we may have to recognize these expenses without realizing the expected benefits of the transaction. We also expect to incur a number of non-recurring transaction-related costs associated with combining the operations of the two companies and achieving desired synergies. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of our business with Coherent’s business. There can be no assurance that the elimination of certain duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the two businesses, will offset the incremental transaction-related costs over time. Thus, any net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, the long term or at all. The closing of our acquisition of Coherent may trigger change in control provisions in certain agreements to which Coherent is a party. 38Certain agreements to which Coherent is a party contain change in control provisions that may be triggered when we complete our acquisition of Coherent. If we and Coherent are unable to negotiate waivers of those provisions, the counterparties may exercise their rights and remedies under the agreements, potentially terminating the agreements or seeking monetary damages. Even if we and Coherent are able to negotiate waivers, the counterparties may require a fee for such waivers or seek to renegotiate the agreements on terms less favorable to us. We and Coherent each are subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while our acquisition of Coherent is pending, which could adversely affect each of our and Coherent’s respective businesses and operations. Under the terms of the merger agreement, we and Coherent are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our respective businesses prior to completing the transaction, which may adversely affect each party’s ability to execute certain of its business strategies. Such limitations could negatively affect each party’s businesses and operations prior to the completion of the transaction. Furthermore, the process of planning to integrate the two companies can divert management attention and resources and could ultimately have an adverse effect on us.In connection with the transaction, parties with which we or Coherent do business may experience uncertainty associated with the transaction, including with respect to current or future business relationships with us, Coherent or the combined business. It is possible that some customers, suppliers and other persons with whom we or Coherent have a business relationship may delay or defer certain business decisions or might decide to seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationships with us or Coherent, as applicable, as a result of the transaction, which could negatively affect our or Coherent’s revenues, earnings and cash flows, as well as the market price of shares of our common stock, regardless of whether the transaction is completed. Holders of our capital stock will have a reduced ownership and voting interest in us after the completion of our acquisition of Coherent and the expected remaining equity financing and therefore then will have less voting influence. Each Coherent stockholder who receives shares of our common stock as merger consideration will become a shareholder of ours. We estimate that, upon completion of the acquisition, former Coherent stockholders collectively will own approximately 15%, our shareholders as of immediately prior to the completion of the transaction (excluding as a result of the expected remaining equity financing) will own approximately 71%, and BCPE will own approximately 14% of our outstanding shares of common stock (in each case, on an as-converted and fully diluted basis and without regard to the fact that immediately prior to the completion of the transaction, certain holders may own both our common stock and Coherent’s common stock). As a result, our shareholders will have less voting influence on us and may have less influence on our management and policies than they now have on us.Shareholder litigation could prevent or delay the closing of our acquisition of Coherent or otherwise negatively impact our business and operations. We may incur costs in connection with the defense or settlement of any shareholder lawsuits filed in connection with our pending acquisition of Coherent. Such litigation could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could prevent or delay the consummation of the transaction. The issuance and sale of shares of our Series B-1 Preferred Stock has reduced, and the issuance and sale of our Series B-2 Preferred Stock will reduce, the relative voting power of holders of our other capital stock, will dilute the ownership of such holders and may adversely affect the market price of our securities. On March 31, 2021, we issued 75,000 shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock to BCPE. Those shares of Series B-1 Preferred Stock currently have voting rights and may vote as one class with our common stock, on an as-converted basis, subject to limited exceptions. Upon completion of our acquisition of Coherent, we will issue and sell 140,000 shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock to BCPE. Those shares of Series B-2 Preferred Stock will have voting rights, voting as one class with our common stock and our Series B-1 Preferred Stock, on an as-converted basis, subject to limited exceptions. Therefore, the issuance and sale of Series B-1 Preferred Stock resulted, and the issuance and sale of Series B-2 Preferred Stock will result, in the immediate and substantial dilution to the ownership interests of the holders of our capital stock, including our common stock and our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. Any sales in the public market of our common stock issuable upon conversion of Series B Preferred Stock could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our other outstanding securities. Similarly, the perception that such sales might occur could have a material adverse effect on such market prices. Our Series B-1 Preferred Stock have, and the Series B-2 Preferred Stock to be issued upon completion of our pending acquisition of Coherent will have rights, preferences and privileges that are not held by, and are preferential to, the rights of holders of our other outstanding capital stock. 39In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our affairs, the holders of our Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to receive certain payments (i) prior to any amounts paid to holders of our common stock and each other class or series of our capital stock now existing or hereafter authorized, the terms of which do not expressly provide that such class or series ranks either (x) senior to the Series B Preferred Stock as to dividend rights or distribution rights upon such a liquidation event or (y) on parity with the Series B Preferred Stock as to dividend rights and distribution rights upon a such a liquidation event and (ii) on parity with our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and each other class or series of our capital stock established in the future, the terms of which expressly provide that such class or series ranks on a parity basis with the Series B Preferred Stock as to dividend rights and distribution rights upon such a liquidation event. In addition, the holders of Series B Preferred Stock also have certain redemption, conversion and consent rights. These provisions may make it more costly for a potential acquirer to engage in a business combination transaction with us. Provisions that have the effect of potentially discouraging, delaying or preventing such a transaction could limit the opportunity for our shareholders to receive a premium for their shares of our capital stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our capital stock. This could reduce the remaining amount of our assets, if any, available to distribute to holders of our capital stock. Our obligations to the holders of Series B Preferred Stock could limit our ability to obtain additional financing or increase our borrowing costs, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition. These preferential rights could also result in divergent interests between the holders of shares of our Series B Preferred Stock and other holders of our capital stock. The redemption rights of the holders of Series B Preferred Stock may result in the use of our cash in such a way that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations and, therefore, the interests of holders of our other capital stock. At any time on or after the ten-year anniversary of the applicable issuance date of the shares of our Series B Preferred Stock and subject to the procedures set forth in the terms of the Series B Preferred Stock, each holder of such shares will have the right to require us to redeem all of such holder’s shares for cash at a price per share equal to the sum of the applicable stated value for such shares plus accrued or declared and unpaid dividends on such shares that had not previously been added to such stated value. This may have the effect of reducing funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes, thereby negatively affecting the interests of holders of our other capital stock, including our common stock and our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. Holders of our Series B Preferred Stock can exercise significant control over us, which could limit the ability of holders of our other capital stock to influence the outcome of key transactions, including a change of control. The Series B-1 Preferred Stock has, and the Series B-2 Preferred Stock will have, voting rights, allowing holders to vote as one class with our common stock on an as-converted basis, subject to limited exceptions. As a result, the holders of Series B-1 Preferred Stock have, and the holders of Series B-2 Preferred Stock will have, the ability to significantly influence the outcome of any matter submitted for the vote of the holders of our common stock. Holders of Series B Preferred Stock are entitled to act separately in their own respective interests with respect to their ownership interests in us and have the ability to substantially influence all matters that require approval by our shareholders, including the approval of significant corporate transactions. Additionally, we may not undertake certain actions without the prior written approval of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock, voting separately from our common stock. Subject to certain exceptions, we must not: (1) alter or change the rights, preferences or privileges of our Series B Preferred Stock or amend, modify or supplement any provision of our organizational documents in a manner that adversely affects the rights, powers, preferences or privileges of our Series B Preferred Stock; (2) authorize or issue any senior stock (as defined below) (or securities convertible into senior stock), or amend or alter our articles of incorporation to increase the number of authorized or issued shares of our Series B Preferred Stock; (3) decrease the number of authorized shares of our Series B Preferred Stock (other than as permitted pursuant to a conversion, redemption or repurchase by us thereof); (4) issue any shares of our Series B Preferred Stock (other than pursuant to the Investment Agreement); and (5) effect any voluntary deregistration or delisting with Nasdaq of our common stock. Furthermore, we may not, unless holders of Series B Preferred Stock otherwise consent in writing (or if such action is taken with respect to a Permitted Issuance (as defined in the Investment Agreement)), so long as BCPE owns at least 5% of the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock that it held immediately following the completion of either the issuance and sale of the Series B-1 Preferred Stock on March 31, 2021 (if the issuance and sale of the Series B-2 Preferred Stock has not occurred) or the issuance and sale of the Series B-2 Preferred Stock upon completion of our pending acquisition of Coherent, (i) authorize or issue any parity stock (as defined below) and (ii) pay any cash dividend on our common stock (other than ordinary dividends (as defined below)). We also may not, unless BCPE otherwise consents in writing (or if such action is taken with respect to a Permitted Issuance (as defined in the Investment Agreement)), so long as it owns at least 25% of the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock that it held immediately following the completion of either the issuance and sale of the Series B-1 Preferred Stock on March 31, 2021 (if the issuance and sale of the Series B-2 Preferred Stock has not occurred) or the issuance and sale of the Series B-2 Preferred Stock upon completion of our pending acquisition of Coherent, redeem, 40repurchase or otherwise acquire (or make or declare any dividend or distribution in respect of) any junior stock (as defined below) (subject to certain exceptions, including, among other things, ordinary dividends, non-cash dividends or other distributions paid pro rata to all holders of our common stock and, if applicable, holders of Series B Preferred Stock, repurchases of junior stock of up to $100 million on an aggregate annual basis and dividends on junior stock in kind or in the form of other junior securities or securities convertible into or exchange for such junior securities). Moreover, under the terms of the Investment Agreement, following the closing of the initial investment and for so long as BCPE beneficially owns shares of Series B Preferred Stock (or shares of our common stock issued upon the conversion thereof) that represent, in the aggregate and on an as-converted basis, at least 25% of the number of shares of Series B Preferred Stock that it held immediately following the completion of either the issuance and sale of the Series B-1 Preferred Stock on March 31, 2021 (if the issuance and sale of the Series B-2 Preferred Stock has not occurred) or the issuance and sale of the Series B-2 Preferred Stock upon completion of our pending acquisition of Coherent, BCPE will have the right to nominate one designee and to designate one observer to the our board of directors. Circumstances may occur in which the interests of BCPE could conflict with the interests of holders of other outstanding capital stock, including our common stock and our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. The market prices of our securities may decline in the future as a result of our acquisition of Coherent. The market prices of our securities, including our common stock and our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, may decline in the future as a result of our acquisition of Coherent for a number of reasons, including: •the unsuccessful integration of Coherent (including for the reasons set forth above); and•our failure to achieve the perceived benefits of the acquisition, including financial results, as rapidly as or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts.Many of these factors are beyond our control. As a consequence, holders of our capital stock, including our common stock and our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, could lose the value of their investment in our capital stock. We currently anticipate that our acquisition of Coherent will be accretive to earnings per share (on an adjusted earnings basis) in the second year after the completion of the acquisition. This expectation is based on preliminary estimates which may materially change. We also could encounter additional transaction-related costs or other factors such as the failure to realize all of the benefits anticipated in the acquisition. All of these factors could cause dilution to our earnings per share or decrease or delay the expected accretive effect of the acquisition and cause a decrease in the market prices of our securities, including our common stock and our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. Our future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations following the completion of our acquisition of Coherent. Following the completion of our acquisition of Coherent, the size of our business will increase significantly beyond the current size of either our or Coherent’s current businesses. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to manage this expanded business, which may pose substantial challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity. There can be no assurance that we will be successful or that we will realize the expected operating efficiencies, cost savings, revenue enhancements and other benefits currently anticipated from the acquisition. We and Coherent face competition, which is expected to intensify after the closing of our acquisition of Coherent and which may reduce our market share and profits after consummation of the acquisition. Competition in the industries in which we and Coherent operate is intense. Increased competition could hurt our and Coherent’s businesses, hinder our respective market share expansions and lead to pricing pressures that may adversely impact our respective margins and revenues. If we are unable to successfully compete following the completion of the acquisition, our business, prospects, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Following the consummation of the acquisition, our competitive position could be weakened by strategic alliances or consolidation within our industries or the development of new technologies by competitors. Our ability to compete successfully will depend on how well we markets our products and services and on our ability to anticipate and respond to various competitive factors affecting our industries, including changes in customer preferences, and changes in the product offerings or pricing strategies of our competitors. After the consummation of the acquisition, competition could materially adversely affect us in several ways, including (i) the loss of customers and market share, (ii) our need to lower prices or increase expenses to remain competitive and (iii) the loss of business relationships within our existing markets. We expect to incur substantial expenses related to our acquisition of Coherent and the related integration. 41We expect to incur substantial expenses in connection with our acquisition of Coherent and the related integration. There are a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that may need to be integrated, including purchasing, accounting and finance, sales, payroll, pricing and benefits. While we have assumed that a certain level of expenses will be incurred, there are many factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration expenses. Moreover, many of the expenses that will be incurred are, by their nature, difficult to estimate accurately. These expenses could, particularly in the near term, exceed the savings that we expect to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings. These integration expenses likely will result in us taking significant charges against earnings following the completion of the acquisition, and the amount and timing of such charges are uncertain at present. Following the consummation of our acquisition of Coherent, we will be bound by all of the obligations and liabilities of both companies. Following the consummation of our acquisition of Coherent, we will become bound by all of the obligations and liabilities of Coherent in addition to our obligations and liabilities existing prior to the consummation of the acquisition. We cannot predict the financial condition of the combined company at the time of the completion of the acquisition or our ability to satisfy our obligations and liabilities following the completion of the acquisition. Our acquisition of Coherent may result in a loss of suppliers and strategic alliances and may result in the termination of existing contracts. Following the completion of our acquisition of Coherent, some of our suppliers or suppliers of Coherent may increase prices or may terminate or scale back their business relationship with us, or even become competitors of ours. We and Coherent have contracts with suppliers, vendors, and other business partners which may require us or Coherent to obtain consents from these other parties in connection with the pending transaction, which may not be obtained at all or on favorable terms. If supplier relationships or strategic alliances are adversely affected by our acquisition of Coherent, or if we, following the completion of the transaction, lose the benefits of our or Coherent’s contracts, our business and financial performance could suffer. Risks Relating to Our Capital StockThe trading prices for our securities have been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future.The trading prices for our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market Composite varied between a high of $100.44 per share and a low of $36.04 per share in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. Likewise, the trading prices of our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock varied between a high of $407.35 per share and a low of $174.38 per share in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. The market prices of our securities could fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including the following:•future announcements concerning us or our competitors;•the overall performance of equity markets;•the trading volume of our securities;•additions or changes to our board of directors, management, or key personnel;•regulatory actions (including, but not limited to, developments in international trade policy) and enforcement actions bearing on manufacturing, development, marketing, or sales;•the commencement or outcome of litigation;•reports and recommendations of analysts and whether or not we meet the milestones, metrics, and other expectations set forth in such reports;•gaining or losing large customers;•the introduction of new products or services and market acceptance of such products or services;•the impact of any public health crisis on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects or those of our customers and suppliers;•the acquisition or loss of significant manufacturers, distributors, or suppliers or an inability to obtain sufficient quantities of materials needed to provide our services;•the issuance of common stock or other securities (including shares of common stock issued upon conversion of any shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock or upon conversion of our outstanding convertible notes);•incurrence of indebtedness;•quarterly variations in operating results;•our ability to accurately forecast future performance;42•business acquisitions or divestitures, including developments relating to our pending acquisition of Coherent;•fluctuations in the economy, political events, or general market conditions; and•changes in our operating industry generally.In addition, stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years, including as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, these fluctuations frequently have been unrelated to the operating performance or underlying fundamentals of the affected companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. These fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance or out of our control, and could lead to securities class action litigation that could result in substantial expenses and diversion of management’s attention and corporate resources, any or all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.We expect that the market price of our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock will be influenced by yield and interest rates in the capital markets, the time remaining to the mandatory conversion date applicable to the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, our creditworthiness, and the occurrence of certain events affecting us that do not require an adjustment to the fixed conversion rates of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. Fluctuations in yield rates in particular may give rise to arbitrage opportunities based upon changes in the relative values of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and our common stock. Any such arbitrage could, in turn, affect the market prices of our common stock and the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. The market price of our common stock could also be affected by possible sales of our common stock by investors who view the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock as a more attractive means of equity participation in us and by hedging or arbitrage trading activity that we expect to develop involving our common stock. This trading activity could, in turn, affect the market price of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock.Provisions in our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (the “Articles of Incorporation”) and Amended and Restated Bylaws (the “Bylaws”) and the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law (the “BCL”) may delay or prevent our acquisition by a third party, which could also reduce the market price of our capital stock. Our Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws contain provisions that could make us a less attractive target for a hostile takeover and could make more difficult or discourage a merger proposal, a tender offer, or a proxy contest. Such provisions include:•a requirement that shareholder-nominated director nominees be nominated in advance of the meeting at which directors are elected and that specific information be provided in connection with such nomination;•the ability of our board of directors to issue additional shares of common stock or preferred stock without shareholder approval; and•certain provisions requiring supermajority approval (at least two-thirds of the votes cast by all shareholders entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class).In addition, the BCL contains provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our control or changes in our management. Many of these provisions are triggered if any person or group acquires, or discloses the intent to acquire, 20% or more of a corporation’s voting power, subject to certain exceptions. These provisions:•provide the other shareholders of the corporation with certain rights against the acquiring group or person;•prohibit the corporation from engaging in a broad range of business combinations with the acquiring group or person;•restrict the voting and other rights of the acquiring group or person; and•provide that certain profits realized by the acquiring group or person from the sale of our equity securities belong to and are recoverable by us.Regardless of the amount of a person’s holdings, if a shareholder or shareholder group (including affiliated persons) would be a party to certain proposed transactions with us or would be treated differently from other shareholders of ours in certain proposed transactions, the BCL requires approval by a majority of votes entitled to be cast by all shareholders other than the interested shareholder or affiliate group, unless the transaction is approved by independent directors or other criteria are satisfied. Furthermore, under the BCL, a “short-form” merger of II-VI cannot be implemented without the consent of our board of directors.In addition, as permitted by Pennsylvania law, an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation or other corporate action that is approved by shareholders may provide mandatory special treatment for specified groups of nonconsenting shareholders of the same class. For example, an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation or other corporate action may provide that shares of common stock held by designated shareholders of record must be cashed out at a price determined by the Company, subject to applicable dissenters’ rights.43Furthermore, the BCL provides that directors, in discharging their duties, may consider, to the extent they deem appropriate, the effects of any action upon shareholders, employees, suppliers, customers, and the communities in which the corporation’s offices are located. Directors are not required to consider the interests of shareholders to a greater degree than other constituencies’ interests. The BCL expressly provides that directors do not violate their fiduciary duties solely by relying on “poison pills” or the anti-takeover provisions of the BCL. We do not currently have a “poison pill.”All of these provisions may limit the price that investors may be willing to pay for shares of our capital stock.In addition, certain rights of the holders of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. For example, if any of certain fundamental changes were to occur on or prior to July 1, 2023, holders of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock may have the right to convert their Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, at an increased conversion rate and will also be entitled to receive a make-whole amount equal to the present value of all remaining dividend payments on their Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, as described in the applicable Statement with Respect to Shares governing the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. Likewise, if any of certain fundamental changes were to occur, we or the surviving entity would be required to make an offer to repurchase, at the option and election of the holders thereof, for cash each share of Series B Preferred Stock then outstanding. These features of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management.Because we do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock, holders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value and by the intended anti-dilution actions of our share-buyback program.We have never declared nor paid dividends on our common stock and do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings to support operations and to finance the development of our business. As a result, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon future appreciation in its value. There is no guarantee that our common stock will maintain its value or appreciate in value.Our ability to declare and pay dividends on our capital stock may be limited, including by the terms of our existing Credit Agreement.Our declaration and payment of dividends on our capital stock in the future will be determined by our board of directors (or an authorized committee thereof) in its sole discretion and will depend on our financial condition, earnings, growth prospects, other uses of cash, funding requirements, applicable Pennsylvania law, and other factors our board of directors deems relevant.The terms of the Credit Agreement contain a restriction on our ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock. If the terms of the Credit Agreement restrict our ability to pay cash dividends on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, we will pay any dividends declared by our board of directors (or an authorized committee thereof) on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock in the form of shares of common stock. In addition, credit facilities, indentures, or other financing agreements that we enter into in the future may contain provisions that restrict or prohibit our ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock.In addition, under Pennsylvania law, our board of directors may not pay dividends if after giving effect to the relevant dividend payment we (i) would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of our business or (ii) our total assets would not be greater than or equal to the sum of our total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed if we were to be dissolved at the time as of which the dividend is measured, in order to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of shareholders whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the dividend. Even if we are permitted under our contractual obligations and Pennsylvania law to pay cash dividends on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, we may not have sufficient cash to pay cash dividends on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock.Trading in preferred stock that we have issued may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.The market price of our common stock is likely to be influenced by the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and, to the extent that markets develop when applicable trading limitations no longer apply, our Series B Preferred Stock. For example, the market price of our common stock could become more volatile and could depress possible sales of our common stock to shareholders who view the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock or Series B Preferred Stock as more attractive means of equity participation in us than owning shares of our common stock.Our common stock is subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness; the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock; and any other preferred stock we may issue in the future. Our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock rank junior to all of our and our subsidiaries’ consolidated liabilities.Shares of our common stock are equity interests that rank junior to all indebtedness and other non-equity claims on us with respect to assets available to satisfy our claims, including in a liquidation of the Company. Additionally, holders of our common stock may be subject to prior dividend and liquidation rights of any holders of our preferred stock or depositary shares representing such preferred stock then outstanding.44Our common stock ranks junior to our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends and amounts payable in the event of our liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of our affairs. This means that, unless accumulated dividends have been paid on all the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock then outstanding through the most recently completed dividend period, no dividends may be declared or paid on our common stock and we will not be permitted to repurchase any of our common stock, subject to limited exceptions. Likewise, in the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of our affairs, no distribution of our assets may be made to holders of our common stock until we have paid to holders of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock then outstanding the applicable liquidation preferences.In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of our affairs, our assets will be available to pay obligations on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock only after all of our consolidated liabilities have been paid. In addition, the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock rank structurally junior to all existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of our affairs, there may not be sufficient assets remaining, after paying our and our subsidiaries’ liabilities, to pay amounts due on any or all of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock then outstanding.Our board of directors can issue, without approval of the holders of our common stock, preferred stock with voting and conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock, the rights of holders of shares of our capital stock, or the market price of our capital stock.Our Articles of Incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue one or more additional series of preferred stock and set the terms of the preferred stock without seeking any further approval from our shareholders. Any preferred stock that is issued will rank ahead of our common stock in terms of dividends and liquidation rights. If we issue additional preferred stock, it may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Our board of directors also has the power, without shareholder approval, subject to applicable law, to set the terms of any such series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights, preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends, and other terms, or upon our liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of our affairs. If we issue additional preferred stock in the future that has a preference over our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of our affairs, or if we issue additional preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock, the rights of holders of our capital stock or the market price of our capital stock could be adversely affected. The issuance of preferred stock or even the ability to issue preferred stock could also have the effect of delaying, deterring, or preventing a change of control or other corporate action.Reports published by securities or industry analysts, freelance bloggers and credit rating agencies, including projections in those reports that exceed our actual results, could adversely affect our share price and trading volume.Research analysts and freelance bloggers publish their own quarterly projections regarding our operating results. These projections may vary widely from one another and may not accurately predict the results we actually achieve. Our share price may decline if we fail to meet securities research analysts’ projections. Similarly, if one or more of the analysts who cover us change their recommendations regarding our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our share price could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, our share price or trading volume could decline.Regulatory actions may adversely affect the trading price and liquidity of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock.Holders of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock who employ, or seek to employ, a convertible arbitrage strategy with respect to the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock may be adversely impacted by regulatory developments that may limit or restrict such a strategy. The SEC and other regulatory and self-regulatory authorities have implemented various rules and may adopt additional rules in the future that restrict and otherwise regulate short selling, over-the-counter swaps, and security-based swaps, which restrictions and regulations may adversely affect the ability of investors in, or potential purchasers of, the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock to conduct a convertible arbitrage strategy with respect to the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. This could, in turn, adversely affect the trading price and liquidity of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock.Holders of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock have no voting rights with respect to the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, except under limited circumstances.Holders of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock have no voting rights with respect to the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, except with respect to certain amendments to the terms of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, in the case of certain dividend arrearages, in certain other limited circumstances, and except as specifically required by applicable Pennsylvania law or by our amended and restated Articles of Incorporation. Holders of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock have no right to vote for any members of our board of directors, except in the case of certain dividend arrearages.45If dividends on any Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock have not been declared and paid for the equivalent of six or more dividend periods (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the dividend period beginning on, and including, the initial issue date of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and ending on, but excluding, October 1, 2020), whether or not for consecutive dividend periods, the holders of such Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class with holders of all other series of preferred stock ranking equally with the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and having similar voting rights, will be entitled at our next special or annual meeting of shareholders to vote for the election of a total of two additional members of our board of directors, subject to certain limitations.We depend on our subsidiaries for cash to fund our operations and expenses, including future dividend payments with respect to our outstanding preferred stock.A significant portion of our operations is conducted through our subsidiaries, and our ability to generate cash to meet our debt service obligations or to make future dividend payments with respect to the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and, to the extent we elect to make such payments in cash, our Series B Preferred Stock is highly dependent on the earnings and the receipt of funds from our subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries are separate legal entities that have no obligation to make any funds available to us, whether by dividends, loans, or other payments.46"
5,COHR,COHERENT INC,2020-08-26,">Item 1A. RISK FACTORSThe following are certain risk factors that could affect our business, results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  These risk factors should be considered along with the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, because these factors could cause our actual results or financial condition to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. The following discussion is not an all-inclusive listing of risks, although we believe these are the more material risks that we face. If any of the following occur, our business, results of operations, financial position, or cash flows could be adversely affected. You should carefully consider these factors, as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, when evaluating an investment in our securities. Risks Relating to Our Business and Our IndustryInvestments in future markets of potential significant growth may not result in the expected return. We continue to make investments in programs with the goal of gaining a greater share of end markets using semiconductor lasers and other components including those used for 3D sensing and emerging 5G technology. We cannot guarantee that our investments in capital and capabilities will be sufficient. The potential end markets, as well as our ability to gain market share in such markets, may not materialize on the timeline anticipated or at all. We cannot be sure of the end market price, specification, or yield for products incorporating our technologies. Our technologies could fail to fulfill, partially or completely, our target customers’ specifications. We cannot guarantee the end market customers’ acceptance of our technologies. Further, we may be unable to fulfill the terms of our contracts with our target customers, which could result in penalties of a material nature, including damages, loss of market share, and loss of reputation.Our competitive position depends on our ability to develop new products and processes. To meet our strategic objectives, we must develop, manufacture, and market new products and continue to update our existing products and processes to keep pace with market developments to address increasingly sophisticated customer requirements. Our success in developing and selling new and enhanced products and processes depends upon a variety of factors, including strategic product selection, efficient completion of product design and development, timely implementation of manufacturing and assembly processes, effective sales and marketing, and high-quality and successful product performance in the market.The introduction by our competitors of products or processes using new developments that are better or faster than ours could render our products or processes obsolete or unmarketable. We intend to continue to make significant investments in research, development, and engineering to achieve our goals. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new products or enhancements to our existing products and processes in a manner which satisfies customer needs or achieves market acceptance. The failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business and maintain our competitive position and on our results of operations and/or financial condition.Widespread health crises, including the global novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic, which continues to spread throughout the United States and world. We are closely monitoring the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all aspects of our business, including the impact to our suppliers, customers, and employees as well as the impact to the countries and markets in which we operate. At the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak, we began focusing intensely on mitigating the adverse impacts of COVID-19 on our foreign and domestic operations, starting by protecting our employees, suppliers, and customers.Significant reductions in demand for one or more of our products or a curtailment to one or more of our product lines may be caused by, among other things, the temporary inability of our customers to purchase and utilize our products in next-stage manufacturing due to shutdown orders or financial hardship.Workforce constraints triggered by shutdown orders and stay-at-home polices may present challenges in meeting our obligations to our customers and achieving cost and operational targets. For example, approximately 45% of our global facilities are subject to a government order, including approximately 10% that are currently closed, most of which are administrative facilities where employees are working remotely. We expect facilities to continue to be subject to similar government orders for the foreseeable future.We may face disruptions from our third-party manufacturing and raw materials supply arrangements caused by constraints over their workforce capacity or their own financial or operational difficulties. There is also heightened risk and uncertainty regarding the loss or disruption of other essential third-party service providers, including transportation services, contract manufacturing, marketing, and distribution services.24Governmental and regulatory responses to the pandemic may include quarantines, import/export restrictions, price controls, or other governmental or regulatory actions, including closures or other restrictions that limit or close our operating and manufacturing facilities, restrict our workforce’s ability to travel or perform necessary business functions, or otherwise impact our suppliers or customers, which could adversely impact our operating results.Such efforts to ensure the safety of our workforce, customers, and suppliers may result in increased operating expenses and potentially jeopardize the efficiency of operations. Such impacts may further increase the difficulty of planning for operations and may adversely impact our results.We have made efforts to identify, manage, and mitigate the economic disruption impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic to the Company; however, there are factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of this outbreak or any such similar outbreak, as well as further governmental and regulatory actions.Global economic downturns, including any downturn related to COVID-19, may adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. Current and future conditions in the global economy have an inherent degree of uncertainty. As a result, it is difficult to estimate the level of growth or contraction of the global economy as a whole. It is even more difficult to estimate growth or contraction in various parts, sectors, and regions of the economy, including the industrial, aerospace and defense, optical communications, telecommunications, semiconductor, consumer, and medical and life science markets in which we participate. All aspects of our Company’s forecast depend on estimates of growth or contraction in the markets we serve. Thus, prevailing global economic uncertainties render estimates of future income and expenditures very difficult to make. Global economic downturns may affect industries in which our customers operate. These changes could include decreases in the rate of consumption or use of our customers’ products. Such conditions could have a material adverse effect on demand for our customers’ products and, in turn, on demand for our products. Adverse changes may occur in the future as a result of declining or flat global or regional economic conditions, fluctuations in currency and commodity prices, wavering confidence, capital expenditure reductions, unemployment, decline in stock markets, contraction of credit availability, or other factors affecting economic conditions. For example, factors that may affect our operating results include disruption in the credit and financial markets in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere, adverse effects of slowdowns in the U.S., European, or Chinese economies, reductions or limited growth in consumer spending or consumer credit, global trade tariffs, and other adverse economic conditions that may be specific to the Internet, e-commerce, and payments industries. Adverse changes could also occur as a result of economic upswings, such as increased wages and scarce labor pools, and increased interest rates.These changes may negatively affect sales of products and increase exposure to losses from bad debt and commodity prices, the cost and availability of financing, and costs associated with manufacturing and distributing products. Any economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.Some systems that use our products are complex in design, and our products may contain defects that are not detected until deployed, which could increase our costs, reduce our revenues, cause us to lose key customers, and may expose us to litigation related to our products. Some systems that use our products are inherently complex in design and require ongoing maintenance. Our customers may discover defects in our products after the products have been fully deployed and operated under peak stress conditions. In addition, some of our products are combined with products from other vendors which may contain defects. Should problems occur, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. If we are unable to correct defects or other problems, we could experience, among other things, loss of customers, increased costs of product returns and warranty expenses, damage to our brand reputation, failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance, diversion of development and engineering resources, or legal action by our customers.The occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.25Foreign currency risk may negatively affect our revenues, cost of sales, and operating margins, and could result in foreign exchange losses. We conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most countries in which we operate. Our net sales outside the United States represented a majority of our total sales in each of the last three fiscal years. We incur currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a different currency from the currency in which it operates, or holds assets or liabilities in a currency different from its functional currency. Changes in exchange rates can also affect our results of operations when the value of sales and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars. We cannot accurately predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations. Further, given the volatility of exchange rates, we may not be able to effectively manage our currency risks, and any volatility in currency exchange rates may increase the price of our products in local currency to our foreign customers or increase the manufacturing cost of our products, either of which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows, and profitability.Our competitive position may still require significant investments. We continuously monitor the marketplace for strategic opportunities, and our business strategy includes expanding our product lines and markets through both internal product development and acquisitions. Consequently, we expect to continue to consider strategic acquisition of businesses, products, or technologies complementary to our business. This may require significant investments of management time and financial resources. If market demand is outside our organic capabilities, if a strategic acquisition is required and we cannot identify one or execute on it, and/or if financial investments that we undertake distract management, do not result in the expected return on investment, expose us to unforeseen liabilities, or jeopardize our ability to comply with our credit facility covenants due to any inability to integrate the business, adjust to operating a larger and more complex organization, adapt to additional political and other requirements associated with the acquired business, retain staff, or work with customers, we could suffer a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.We may be unable to successfully implement our acquisitions strategy or integrate acquired companies and personnel with existing operations. We have in the past acquired several companies, including the completion of our acquisition of Finisar Corporation (“Finisar”) in September 2019. We may continue to expand and diversify our operations with additional acquisitions. We may be unable to identify or complete prospective acquisitions for many reasons, including increasing competition from other potential acquirers, the effects of consolidation in our industries, and potentially high valuations of acquisition candidates. In addition, applicable antitrust laws and other regulations may limit our ability to acquire targets or force us to divest an acquired business line. If we are unable to identify suitable targets or complete acquisitions, our growth prospects may suffer, and we may not be able to realize sufficient scale and technological advantages to compete effectively in all markets. To the extent that we are successful in making acquisitions, we may be unsuccessful in integrating acquired companies or product lines with existing operations, or the integration may be more difficult or more costly than anticipated. Some of the risks that may affect our ability to integrate or realize anticipated benefits from acquired companies, businesses, or assets include those associated with: •unexpected losses of key employees of the acquired company; •conforming the acquired company’s standards, processes, procedures, and controls with our operations, including integrating enterprise resource planning systems and other key business applications; •coordinating new product and process development; •increasing complexity from combining operations; •increasing the scope, geographic diversity, and complexity of our operations; •difficulties in consolidating facilities and transferring processes and know-how; and •diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns. 26In connection with acquisitions, we may: •use a signification portion of our available cash; •issue equity securities, which would dilute current shareholders’ percentage ownership; •incur significant debt; •incur or assume contingent liabilities, known or unknown, including potential lawsuits, infringement actions, or similar liabilities; •incur impairment charges related to goodwill or other intangibles; and •face antitrust or other regulatory inquiries or actions.In addition, the market price of our common stock or our 6.00% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (“Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock”) could be adversely affected if the effect of any acquisitions on our consolidated financial results is dilutive or is below the market’s or financial analysts’ expectations, or if there are unanticipated changes in the business or financial performance of the acquired or combined company. Any failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses may disrupt our business and adversely impact our business, results of operations, or financial condition.Although II-VI continues to expect that its acquisition of Finisar will result in cost savings, synergies, and other benefits, the combined company may not realize those benefits, or be able to retain those benefits even if realized.The success of II-VI’s acquisition of Finisar will continue to depend in large part on the success of the management of the combined company in integrating the operations, strategies, technologies, and personnel of the two companies. The combined company may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the combination if the integration process takes longer than expected or is more costly than expected. The failure of the combined company to meet the challenges involved in successfully integrating the operations of the two companies or to otherwise realize any of the anticipated benefits of the combination, including additional cost savings and synergies, could impair the operations of the combined company. In addition, II-VI continues to believe that the overall integration of Finisar will be a time-consuming and expensive process that, without proper planning and effective and timely implementation, could significantly disrupt the combined company’s business.Potential difficulties that the combined company may encounter in the integration process include:•the integration of management teams, strategies, technologies and operations, products, and services;•the disruption of ongoing businesses and distraction of their respective management teams from ongoing business concerns;•the retention of, and possible decrease in business from, existing customers of both companies;•the creation of uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies, and information systems;•the reduction of the costs associated with each company’s operations;•the integration of corporate cultures and maintenance of employee morale;•the retention of key employees; and•potential unknown liabilities associated with the merger.The anticipated cost savings, synergies, and other benefits of the acquisition of Finisar assume a successful integration of the companies and are based on projections and other assumptions, which are inherently uncertain. Even if integration is successful, anticipated cost savings, synergies, and other benefits may not be achieved.Our future success depends on continued international sales, and our global operations are complex and present multiple challenges to manage. We anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. The failure to maintain our current volume of international sales could materially affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, and/or cash flows. We manufacture products in the Australia, China, Germany, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Vietnam, and through a contract manufacturer in Thailand. We also maintain direct sales offices in Belgium, Canada, China, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom. Our operations vary by location and are influenced on a location-by-location basis by local customs, languages, and work practices, as well as different local weather conditions, management styles, and education systems. In addition, multiple complex issues may arise concurrently in different countries, potentially hampering our management’s ability to respond in an effective and timely manner. Any inability to respond in an effective and timely manner 27to issues in our global operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.We are subject to complex and rapidly changing import and export regulations which could limit our sales and decrease our profitability. We are subject to the passage of and changes in the interpretation of regulation by U.S. government entities at the federal, state, and local levels and by non-U.S. agencies, including, but not limited to, the following: •We are required to comply with import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our ability to enter into or complete transactions with certain customers, business partners, and other persons. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services, and technologies. We may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item, and granting of a required license cannot be assured. Compliance with the import laws that apply to our businesses may restrict our access to, and may increase the cost of obtaining, certain products and could interrupt our supply of imported inventory.•Exported technologies necessary to develop and manufacture certain products are subject to U.S. export control laws and similar laws of other jurisdictions. We may be subject to adverse regulatory consequences, including government oversight of facilities and export transactions, monetary penalties, and other sanctions for violations of these laws. In certain instances, these regulations may prohibit us from developing or manufacturing certain of our products for specific applications outside the United States. Failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary, and nonmonetary penalties; disruptions to our business; limitations on our ability to import and export products and services; and damage to our reputation.Changes in trade policies, such as increased import duties, could increase the costs of goods imported into the United States or China. In March 2018, President Trump announced new steel and aluminum tariffs. Then, in July 2018 the United States imposed increased tariffs on products of Chinese origin, and China responded by increasing tariffs on U.S.-origin goods. On the export side, denial orders and placing companies on the U.S entity list could decrease our access to customers and markets and materially impact our revenues in the aggregate. In April 2018, for example, the U.S. Department of Commerce issued a denial order against two companies in the telecommunications market. In 2019 and 2020, the U.S. Department of Commerce placed a number of entities, including Huawei, on the U.S. Entity List. If we cannot obtain relief from, or take other action to mitigate the impact of, these additional duties and restrictions and duties, our business and profits may be materially and adversely affected. Further changes in the trade policy of the United States or of other countries with which we do cross-border business, or additional sanctions, could result in retaliatory actions by other countries that could materially and negatively impact the volume of economic activity in the United States or globally, which, in turn, may decrease our access to customers and markets, reduce our revenues, and increase our operating costs.  Our association with customers that are or become subject to U.S. regulatory scrutiny or export restrictions could negatively impact our business, and create instability in our operations. Governmental actions such as these could subject us to actual or perceived reputational harm among current or prospective investors, suppliers or customers, customers of our customers, other parties doing business with us, or the general public. Any such reputational harm could result in the loss of investors, suppliers, or customers, which could harm our business, financial condition, operating results, or prospects.Exports of certain of our products are subject to export controls imposed by the U.S. government and administered by the U.S. Departments of State and Commerce. In certain instances, these regulations may require pre-shipment authorization from the administering department. For products subject to the Export Administration Regulations, or EAR, administered by the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security, the requirement for a license is dependent on the type and end use of the product, the final destination, the identity of the end user, and whether a license exception might apply. Virtually all exports of products subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, or ITAR, administered by the Department of State’s Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, require a license. Certain of our products are subject to EAR controls.  Additionally, certain other products that we sell, including certain products developed with government funding, are subject to ITAR. Products developed and manufactured in our foreign locations are subject to export controls of the applicable foreign nation. Given the current global political climate, obtaining export licenses can be difficult and time-consuming. Failure to obtain export licenses for these shipments, or having one or more of our customers be restricted from receiving exports from us, could significantly reduce our revenue and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Compliance with regulations of the United States and other governments also subjects us to additional fees and costs. The absence of comparable restrictions on competitors in other countries may adversely affect our competitive position. 28Any inability to access financial markets from time to time to raise required capital, finance our working capital requirements or our acquisition strategies, or otherwise support our liquidity needs could negatively impact our ability to finance our operations, meet certain obligations, or implement our growth strategy. We borrow under our existing credit facility or to issue our equity to fund operations, including working capital investments, and to finance our acquisition strategies. In the past, market disruptions experienced in the United States and abroad have materially impacted liquidity in the credit and debt markets, making financing terms for borrowers less attractive and, in certain cases, have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of financing. Uncertainty in the financial markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing or to refinance our existing credit facility or existing debt arrangements on favorable terms or at all, which could negatively affect our ability to fund current and future expansion as well as future acquisitions and development. These disruptions may include turmoil in the financial services industry, volatility in the markets where our outstanding securities trade, and changes in general economic conditions in the areas where we do business. If we are unable to access funds at competitive rates, or if our short-term or long-term borrowing costs increase, our ability to finance our operations, meet our short-term obligations, and implement our operating strategies could be adversely affected. In the future we may be required to raise additional capital through public or private financing or other arrangements. Such financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all, and our failure to raise capital when needed could harm our business and prospects. Additional equity financing may be dilutive to the holders of our common stock, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to undertake certain activities that we otherwise would find to be desirable. Further, debt service obligations associated with any debt financing could reduce our profitability. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to grow our business or respond to competitive pressures.We may not be able to settle conversions of our convertible senior notes in cash or repurchase the notes in accordance with their terms. Holders of our outstanding 0.25% convertible senior notes due 2022 and Finisar’s 0.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2036, which we refer to collectively as our convertible senior notes, have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing such notes) at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, upon conversion of such notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversions (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of such notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of surrendered notes, or pay cash with respect to notes being converted. In addition, our ability to repurchase or to pay cash upon conversion of our notes may be limited by law, regulatory authority, or agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the governing indenture, or to pay any cash upon conversion of the notes as required, would constitute a default under the indenture. A default under the applicable indenture or the fundamental change itself also could lead to a default under agreements governing our credit facility and any of our future indebtedness. If the payment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the notes or to pay cash upon conversion of any such notes.Our credit agreement restricts our operations, particularly our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions regarding our business.The documents governing our amended and restated credit agreement, dated as of September 24, 2019, by and among us, Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender and an L/C Issuer, and the other lenders party thereto (the “Credit Agreement”) contain a number of restrictive covenants that may impose operating and financial restrictions on us and limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interest, including restrictions on the ability to incur indebtedness, grant liens, undergo certain fundamental changes, dispose of assets, make certain investments, enter into certain transactions with affiliates, and make certain restricted payments, in each case subject to limitations and exceptions set forth in the Credit Agreement.29The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default that include, among other things, certain payment defaults, covenant defaults, cross-defaults to other indebtedness, change of control defaults, judgment defaults, and bankruptcy and insolvency defaults. Such events of default may allow the creditors to accelerate the related debt and may result in the acceleration of any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations, and financial results. Furthermore, if we are unable to repay the amounts due and payable under the Credit Agreement, those lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure that indebtedness, which could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation. In the event that our lenders accelerated the repayment of the borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay that indebtedness. Any acceleration of amounts due under the credit agreements would likely have a material adverse effect on us. As a result of these restrictions, we may be limited in how we conduct business, unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to operate during general economic or business downturns, or unable to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities.We may fail to accurately estimate the size and growth of our markets and our customers’ demands. We make significant decisions based on our estimates of customer requirements. We use our estimates to determine the levels of business we seek and accept, production schedules, personnel needs, and other resource requirements.Customers may require rapid increases in production on short notice. We may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or allocate sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet such increases in demand. Rapid customer ramp-up and significant increases in demand may strain our resources or negatively affect our margins. Inability to satisfy customer demand in a timely manner may harm our reputation, reduce our other opportunities, damage our relationships with customers, reduce revenue growth, and/or cause us to incur contractual penalties. Alternatively, downturns in the industries in which we compete may cause our customers to significantly reduce their demand. With respect to orders we initiate with our suppliers to address anticipated demand from our customers, certain suppliers may have required noncancellable purchase commitments or advance payments from us, and those obligations and commitments could reduce our ability to adjust our inventory or expense levels to reflect declining market demands. Unexpected declines in customer demands can result in excess or obsolete inventory and additional charges. Because certain of our sales, research and development, and internal manufacturing overhead expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in customer demand likely would decrease our gross margins and operating income.We may encounter increased competition and we may fail to accurately estimate our competitors’ or our customers’ willingness and capability to backward integrate into our competencies and thereby displace us. We may encounter substantial competition from other companies in the same market, including established companies with significant resources. Some of our competitors may have financial, technical, marketing, or other capabilities that are more extensive than ours. They may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and other competitive pressures. We may not be able to compete successfully against our present or future competitors. Our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.There are limitations on the protection of our intellectual property and we may from time to time be involved in costly intellectual property litigation or indemnification. We rely on a combination of trade secret, patent, copyright, and trademark laws, combined with employee confidentiality, noncompetition, and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance that the steps we take will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or intellectual property. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future. Asserting our intellectual property rights or defending against third-party claims could involve substantial expense. In the event that a third party were successful in a claim that one of our processes infringed its proprietary rights, we could be required to pay substantial damages or royalties, or spend substantial amounts in order to obtain a license or modify processes so that they no longer infringe such proprietary rights. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.The design, processes, and specialized equipment utilized in our engineered materials, advanced components, and subsystems are innovative, complex, and difficult to duplicate. However, there can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent similar technology, or that all aspects of our proprietary technology will be protected. Others have obtained patents covering a variety of materials, devices, equipment, configurations, and processes, and others could obtain patents covering technology similar to ours. We may be required to obtain licenses under such patents, and there can be no assurance that we would be able to obtain such licenses, if required, on commercially reasonable terms, or that claims regarding rights to technology will not be asserted that may adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, our research and development contracts with agencies of the U.S. government present a risk that project-specific technology could be disclosed to competitors as contract reporting requirements are fulfilled. We also enter into development projects from time to time that might result in IP developed during a project that is assigned to the other party without us retaining rights to that IP or is jointly owned with the other party.30A significant portion of our business is dependent on cyclical industries. Our business is dependent on the demand for products produced by end-users of industrial lasers, optical communication products, components for semiconductor capital equipment, and components for 3D sensing. Many of these end-users are in industries that have historically experienced a highly cyclical demand for their products. As a result, demand for our products is subject to these cyclical fluctuations. Fluctuations in demand could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.Our global operations are subject to complex legal and regulatory requirements. We manufacture products in Australia, China, Germany, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Vietnam, and through a contract manufacturer in Thailand. We also maintain direct sales offices in Belgium, Canada, China, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Switzerland, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom. Operations inside and outside of the United States are subject to many legal and regulatory requirements, some of which are not aligned with others. These include tariffs, quotas, taxes and other market barriers, restrictions on the export or import of technology, potentially limited intellectual property protection, import and export requirements and restrictions, anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, foreign investment rules and regulations, data privacy requirements, competition laws, employment and labor laws, pensions and social insurance, and environmental health and safety laws and regulations. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be onerous and expensive, and requirements differ among jurisdictions. New laws, changes in existing laws, and abrogation of local regulations by national laws may result in significant uncertainties in how they will be interpreted and enforced. Failure to comply with any of these foreign laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.Changes in laws and regulations governing data privacy and data protection could have a material adverse impact on our business. We are subject to many data privacy, data protection, and data breach notification laws, including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective in May 2018. While we have taken measures to assess the requirements of, and to comply with, the GDPR, as well as new and existing data-related laws and regulations of other jurisdictions, these measures may be challenged, including by authorities that regulate data-related compliance. We could incur significant expense in facilitating and responding to investigations, and if the measures we have taken prove to be inadequate, we could face fines, penalties, or damages, and incur reputational harm, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.Data breach incidents and breakdown of information and communication technologies could disrupt our operations and impact our financial results. In the course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property (both our own and that of our customers), as well as proprietary business information. We could be subject to service outages or breaches of security systems which may result in disruption, unauthorized access, misappropriation, or corruption of this information. Security breaches of our network or data, including physical or electronic break-ins, vendor service outages, computer viruses, attacks by hackers or similar breaches can create system disruptions, shutdowns, and unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. If we are unable to prevent or contain such security or privacy breaches, our operations could be disrupted or we could suffer legal claims, loss of reputation, financial loss, property damage, or regulatory penalties.We have entered into supply agreements that commit us to supply products on specified terms. We have supply agreements with some customers that require us to supply products and allocate sufficient capacity to make these products. We have also agreed to pricing schedules and methodologies that could result in penalties if we fail to meet development, supply, capacity, and quality commitments. Failure to do so may cause us to be unable to generate the amount of revenue or the level of profitability we expect from these arrangements. Our ability to realize a profit under some of these agreements will be subject to the level of customer demand, the cost of maintaining facilities and manufacturing capacity, and supply chain capability. If we fail to fulfill our commitments under these supply agreements, our business, after using all remedies available, financial conditions, and results of operations may suffer a material adverse effect.We depend on highly complex manufacturing processes that require feeder materials, components, and products from limited sources of supply. Our operations are dependent upon a supply chain of difficult-to-make or difficult-to-refine products and materials. Some of our product inflow is subject to yield reductions from growth or fabrication losses, and thus the quantities we may receive are not consistently predictable. Customers may also change a specification for a product that our suppliers cannot meet. 31We also make products for which the Company is one of the world’s largest suppliers. We use high-quality, optical-grade ZnSe in the production of many of our IR optical products. We are a leading producer of ZnSe for our internal use and for external sale. The production of ZnSe is a complex process requiring a highly controlled environment. A number of factors, including defective or contaminated materials, could adversely affect our ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields of high-quality ZnSe. Lack of adequate availability of high-quality ZnSe could have a material adverse effect upon our business. There can be no assurance that we will not experience manufacturing yield inefficiencies that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. We produce hydrogen selenide gas, which is used in our production of ZnSe. There are risks inherent in the production and handling of such material. Our lack of proper handling of hydrogen selenide could require us to curtail our production of the gas. Our potential inability to internally produce hydrogen selenide could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition. In addition, we produce and use other high-purity and relatively uncommon materials and compounds to manufacture our products, including, but not limited to, ZnS, GaAs, yttrium aluminum garnet, yttrium lithium fluoride, calcium fluoride, germanium, selenium, telluride, Bi2Te3, and SiC. A significant failure of our internal production processes or our suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of these necessary materials on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.Increases in commodity prices may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of increases in commodity prices. Our businesses purchase, produce, and sell high-purity selenium and other raw materials based upon quoted market prices from minor metal exchanges. The negative impact from increases in commodity prices might not be recovered through our product sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings and financial condition.We use and generate potentially hazardous substances that are subject to stringent environmental regulations. Hazardous substances used or generated in some of our research and manufacturing facilities are subject to stringent environmental regulation. We believe that our handling of such substances is in material compliance with applicable environmental, safety, and health regulations at each operating location. We invest substantially in proper personal protective equipment and process controls, including monitoring and specialized training, to minimize risks to employees, surrounding communities, and the environment that could result from the presence and handling of such hazardous substances. When exposure problems or potential exposure problems have been uncovered, corrective actions have been implemented, and re-occurrence has been minimal or nonexistent. We have in place an emergency response plans with respect to our generation and use of the hazardous substances hydrogen selenide, hydrogen sulfide, arsine, and phosphine. Special attention has been given to all procedures pertaining to these gaseous materials to minimize the chance of its accidental release into the atmosphere. With respect to the manufacturing, use, storage, and disposal of the low-level radioactive material thorium fluoride, our facilities and procedures have been inspected and licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Thorium-bearing by-products are collected and shipped as solid waste to a government-approved low-level radioactive waste disposal site in Clive, Utah. The generation, use, collection, storage, and disposal of all other hazardous by-products, such as suspended solids containing heavy metals or airborne particulates, are believed by us to be in material compliance with regulations. We believe that we have obtained all of the permits and licenses required for operation of our business. Although we do not know of any material environmental, safety, or health problems in our properties, processes, or products, there can be no assurance that problems will not develop in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.We have a substantial amount of debt, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations and prevent us from fulfilling our debt-related obligations.As of June 30, 2020, we had approximately $2.3 billion of outstanding debt (including our outstanding debt securities and borrowings under our Credit Agreement). Our indebtedness could have important consequences for us, including:•making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our debt, or to our trade or other creditors;•increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions;•limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions, particularly when the availability of financing in the capital markets is limited;32•requiring us to pay higher interest rates upon refinancing or on our variable-rate indebtedness if interest rates rise;•requiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations and the proceeds of any capital markets offerings or loan borrowings for the payment of interest on our debt and reducing our ability to use our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and general corporate requirements;•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate; and•placing us at a competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors. We may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, together with any future borrowings, to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness, on or before its maturity. We may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, we may incur additional indebtedness in order to finance our operations, fund acquisitions, or repay existing indebtedness. If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets; seeking additional debt or equity; or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments, and alliances. Any such actions, if necessary, may not be able to be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or on terms that would be advantageous to our stockholders, or on terms that would not require us to breach the terms and conditions of our existing or future debt agreements.Unfavorable changes in tax rates, tax liabilities, or tax accounting rules could negatively affect future results. As a global company, we are subject to taxation in the United States and various other countries and jurisdictions. As such, we must exercise a level of judgment in determining our worldwide tax liabilities. Our future tax rates could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in countries with differing tax rates or changes in tax laws. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significantly adverse impact on our effective tax rate. The enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) in December 2017 significantly affected U.S. tax law by changing how the United States imposes tax on multinational corporations. The U.S. Department of Treasury has broad authority under the Tax Act to issue regulations and interpretive guidance. We have applied available guidance to estimate our tax obligations, but new guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department may cause us to make adjustments to our tax estimates in future periods. In addition, we are subject to regular examination of our income tax returns by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different from the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provision and accruals, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operation, or financial condition.Natural disasters or other global or regional catastrophic events could disrupt our operations, give rise to substantial environmental hazards, and adversely affect our results. We may be exposed to business interruptions due to extreme weather caused by climate change and deforestation, force majeure catastrophes, natural disaster, pandemic, terrorism, or acts of war that are beyond our control. Disruptions to our facilities or systems, or to those of our key suppliers, could also interrupt operational processes and adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products and provide services and support to our customers. As a result, our business, results of operations, or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.Our success depends on our ability to attract, retain, and develop key personnel and requires continued good relations with our employees.We are highly dependent upon the experience and continuing services of certain scientists, engineers, production, and management personnel. Competition for the services of these personnel is intense. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain or attract the personnel necessary for our success. The loss of the services of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.We contract with a number of large end-user service providers and product companies that have considerable bargaining power, which may require us to agree to terms and conditions that could have an adverse effect on our business or ability to recognize revenues. Large end-user service providers and product companies comprise a significant portion of our customer base. These customers generally have greater purchasing power than smaller entities and, accordingly, often request and receive more favorable terms from suppliers, including us. As we seek to expand our sales to existing customers and acquire new customers, we may be required to agree to terms and conditions that are favorable to our customers and that may affect the timing of our ability to recognize revenue, increase our costs, and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Furthermore, large customers have increased buying power and ability to require onerous terms in our contracts with them, 33including pricing, warranties, and indemnification terms. If we are unable to satisfy the terms of these contracts, it could result in liabilities of a material nature, including litigation, damages, additional costs, loss of market share, and loss of reputation. Additionally, the terms these large customers require, such as most-favored customer or exclusivity provisions, may impact our ability to do business with other customers and generate revenues from such customers. We may be adversely affected by climate change regulations. In many of the countries in which we operate, government bodies are increasingly enacting legislation and regulations in response to potential impacts of climate change. These laws and regulations may be mandatory. They have the potential to impact our operations directly or indirectly as a result of required compliance by our customers or our supply chain. Inconsistency of regulations may also affect the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations. Assessments of the potential impact of future climate change legislation, regulation, and international treaties and accords are uncertain, given the wide scope of potential regulatory change in countries in which we operate. We may incur increased capital expenditures resulting from required compliance with revised or new legislation or regulations, added costs to purchase raw materials, lower profits from sales of our products, allowances or credits under a “cap and trade” system, increased insurance premiums and deductibles as new actuarial tables are developed to reshape coverage, changes in competitive position relative to industry peers, changes to profit or loss arising from increased or decreased demand for goods produced by us, or changes in costs of goods sold.We depend on large purchases from a few significant customers, and any loss, cancellation, reduction, or delay in purchases by these customers could harm our business. A small number of customers have consistently accounted for a significant portion of our revenues, although none individually represent greater than 10% of total revenues. Our success will depend on our continued ability to develop and manage relationships with our major customers. Although we are attempting to expand our customer base, we expect that significant customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future. We may not be able to offset any decline in revenues from our existing major customers with revenues from new customers, and our quarterly results may be volatile because we are dependent on large orders from these customers that may be reduced, delayed, or cancelled. The markets in which we have historically sold our optical subsystems and components products are dominated by a relatively small number of systems manufacturers, thereby limiting the number of our potential customers. Our dependence on large orders from a relatively small number of customers makes our relationship with each customer critically important to our business. We cannot ensure that we will be able to retain our major customers, attract additional customers, or that our customers will be successful in selling their products that incorporate our products. In addition, governmental trade action or economic sanctions may limit or preclude our ability to do business with certain customers. We have in the past experienced delays and reductions in orders from some of our major customers. In addition, our customers have in the past sought price concessions from us, and we expect that they will continue to do so in the future. Expense reduction measures that we have implemented over the past several years, and additional action we are taking to reduce costs, may adversely affect our ability to introduce new and improved products, which may, in turn, adversely affect our relationships with some of our key customers. Further, some of our customers may in the future shift their purchases of products from us to our competitors or to joint ventures between these customers and our competitors, or may in certain circumstances produce competitive products themselves. The loss of one or more of our major customers, any reduction or delay in sales to these customers, our inability to successfully develop relationships with additional customers, or future price concessions that we may make could significantly harm our business. The manufacturing of our products may be adversely affected if we are unable to manufacture certain products in our manufacturing facilities. We manufacture some of the components that we incorporate into our subsystem products; in other cases, we provide components to contract manufacturers to produce finished goods. For some of the components and finished goods, we are the sole manufacturer. Our manufacturing processes are highly complex, and issues are often difficult to detect and correct. From time to time we have experienced problems achieving acceptable yields in our manufacturing facilities, resulting in delays in the availability of our products. In addition, if we experience problems with our manufacturing facilities, it would be costly and require a long period of time to move the manufacture of these components and finished good products to a different facility or contract manufacturer, which could result in interruptions in supply and would likely materially impact our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, for a variety of reasons, including changes in circumstances at our contract manufacturers or our own business strategies, we may voluntarily, or be required to, transfer the manufacturing of certain products to other manufacturing sites. Changes in manufacturing processes are often required due to changes in product specifications, changing customer needs, and the introduction of new products. These changes may reduce manufacturing yields at our contract manufacturers and at our own manufacturing facilities, resulting in reduced margins on those products. In addition, many of our products are sourced from 34suppliers based outside of the United States, primarily in Asia. Uncertainty with respect to tax and trade policies, tariffs, and government regulations affecting trade between the United States and other countries has recently increased. Major developments in tax policy or trade relations, such as the imposition of tariffs on imported products, could increase our product and product-related costs or require us to seek alternative suppliers, either of which could result in decreased sales or increased product and product-related costs. Failure to accurately forecast our revenues could result in additional charges for obsolete or excess inventories or noncancellable purchase commitments. We base many of our operating decisions, and enter into purchase commitments, on the basis of anticipated revenue trends that are highly unpredictable. Some of our purchase commitments are not cancellable, and in some cases we are required to recognize a charge representing an amount of material or capital equipment purchased or ordered that exceeds our actual requirements. Should revenues in future periods fall substantially below our expectations, or should we fail to accurately forecast changes in demand mix, we could be required to record substantial charges for obsolete or excess inventories or noncancellable purchase commitments.If we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired. As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“the Exchange Act”), the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (""the Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), and Nasdaq listing requirements. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources, including accounting-related costs and significant management oversight. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement, could delay the reporting of our financial results or cause us to be subject to investigations, enforcement actions by regulatory agencies, stockholder lawsuits, or other adverse actions requiring us to incur defense costs or pay fines, settlements, or judgments. Any such failures or difficulties could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Risks Relating to Our Capital StockOur stock price has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future.The market price for our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market Composite varied between a high of $51.90 and a low of $19.00 in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including the following:•future announcements concerning us or our competitors;•the overall performance of equity markets;•the trading volume of our common stock;•additions or changes to our board of directors, management, or key personnel;•regulatory actions (including, but not limited to, developments in international trade policy) and enforcement actions bearing on manufacturing, development, marketing, or sales;•the commencement or outcome of litigation;•reports and recommendations of analysts and whether or not we meet the milestones, metrics, and other expectations set forth in such reports;•gaining or losing large customers;•the introduction of new products or services and market acceptance of such products or services;•the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, financial condition, results of operations, or prospects or those of our customers and suppliers;•the acquisition or loss of significant manufacturers, distributors, or suppliers or an inability to obtain sufficient quantities of materials needed to provide our services;35•the issuance of common stock or other securities (including, without limitation, the shares of common stock issued upon conversion of any shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and the shares issued upon conversion of outstanding convertible notes);•incurrence of indebtedness;•quarterly variations in operating results;•our ability to accurately forecast future performance;•business acquisitions or divestitures;•fluctuations in the economy, political events, or general market conditions; and•changes in our operating industry generally.In addition, stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years and are experiencing exceptional volatility as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, these fluctuations frequently have been unrelated to the operating performance or underlying fundamentals of the affected companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. These fluctuations may be unrelated to our performance or out of our control, and could lead to securities class action litigation that could result in substantial expenses and diversion of management’s attention and corporate resources, any or all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.In addition, we expect that the market price of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock will be influenced by yield and interest rates in the capital markets, the time remaining to the Mandatory Conversion Date, our creditworthiness, and the occurrence of certain events affecting us that do not require an adjustment to the fixed conversion rates of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. Fluctuations in yield rates in particular may give rise to arbitrage opportunities based upon changes in the relative values of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and our common stock. Any such arbitrage could, in turn, affect the market prices of our common stock and the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. The market price of our common stock could also be affected by possible sales of our common stock by investors who view the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock as a more attractive means of equity participation in us and by hedging or arbitrage trading activity that we expect to develop involving our common stock. This trading activity could, in turn, affect the market price of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock.Provisions in our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation (the “Articles of Incorporation”) and Amended and Restated By-Laws (the “By-Laws”) and the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law (the “BCL”) may delay or prevent our acquisition by a third party, which could also reduce the market price of our capital stock. Our Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws contain provisions that could make us a less attractive target for a hostile takeover and could make more difficult or discourage a merger proposal, a tender offer, or a proxy contest. Such provisions include:•a requirement that shareholder-nominated director nominees be nominated in advance of the meeting at which directors are elected and that specific information be provided in connection with such nomination;•the ability of our board of directors to issue additional shares of common stock or preferred stock without shareholder approval; and•certain provisions requiring supermajority approval (at least two-thirds of the votes cast by all shareholders entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class).In addition, the BCL contains provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our control or changes in our management. Many of these provisions are triggered if any person or group acquires, or discloses the intent to acquire, 20% or more of a corporation’s voting power, subject to certain exceptions. These provisions:•provide the other shareholders of the corporation with certain rights against the acquiring group or person;•prohibit the corporation from engaging in a broad range of business combinations with the acquiring group or person;•restrict the voting and other rights of the acquiring group or person; and•provide that certain profits realized by the acquiring group or person from the sale of our equity securities belong to and are recoverable by us.36Regardless of the amount of a person’s holdings, if a shareholder or shareholder group (including affiliated persons) would be a party to certain proposed transactions with us or would be treated differently from other shareholders of ours in certain proposed transactions, the BCL requires approval by a majority of votes entitled to be cast by all shareholders other than the interested shareholder or affiliate group, unless the transaction is approved by independent directors or other criteria are satisfied. Furthermore, under the BCL, a “short-form” merger of II-VI cannot be implemented without the consent of our board of directors.In addition, as permitted by Pennsylvania law, an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation or other corporate action that is approved by shareholders may provide mandatory special treatment for specified groups of nonconsenting shareholders of the same class. For example, an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation or other corporate action may provide that shares of common stock held by designated shareholders of record must be cashed out at a price determined by the Company, subject to applicable dissenters’ rights.Furthermore, the BCL provides that directors, in discharging their duties, may consider, to the extent they deem appropriate, the effects of any action upon shareholders, employees, suppliers, customers, and the communities in which the corporation’s offices are located. Directors are not required to consider the interests of shareholders to a greater degree than other constituencies’ interests. The BCL expressly provides that directors do not violate their fiduciary duties solely by relying on “poison pills” or the anti-takeover provisions of the BCL. We do not currently have a “poison pill.”All of these provisions may limit the price that investors may be willing to pay for shares of our capital stock.In addition, certain rights of the holders of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. For example, if a fundamental change were to occur on or prior to July 1, 2023, holders of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock may have the right to convert their Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, at an increased conversion rate and will also be entitled to receive a make-whole amount equal to the present value of all remaining dividend payments on their Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, as described in the applicable Statement with Respect to Shares governing the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. These features of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management.Because we do not currently intend to pay dividends, holders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value and by the intended anti-dilution actions of our share-buyback program.We have never declared nor paid dividends on our common stock and do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We currently anticipate that we will retain any future earnings to support operations and to finance the development of our business. As a result, the success of an investment in our capital stock will depend entirely upon future appreciation in its value. There is no guarantee that our common stock will maintain its value or appreciate in value.Our ability to declare and pay dividends on our capital stock may be limited, including by the terms of our existing Credit Agreement.Our declaration and payment of dividends on our capital stock in the future will be determined by our board of directors (or an authorized committee thereof) in its sole discretion and will depend on our financial condition, earnings, growth prospects, other uses of cash, funding requirements, applicable Pennsylvania law, and other factors our board of directors deems relevant.The terms of the Credit Agreement contain a restriction on our ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock. If the terms of the Credit Agreement restrict our ability to pay cash dividends on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, we will pay any dividends declared by our board of directors (or an authorized committee thereof) on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock in the form of shares of common stock. In addition, credit facilities, indentures, or other financing agreements that we enter into in the future may contain provisions that restrict or prohibit our ability to pay cash dividends on our capital stock.In addition, under Pennsylvania law, our board of directors may not pay dividends if after giving effect to the relevant dividend payment we (i) would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of our business or (ii) our total assets would not be greater than or equal to the sum of our total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed if we were to be dissolved at the time as of which the dividend is measured, in order to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of shareholders whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the dividend. Even if we are permitted under our contractual obligations and Pennsylvania law to pay cash dividends on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, we may not have sufficient cash to pay cash dividends on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock.The Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.The market price of our common stock is likely to be influenced by the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. For example, the market price of our common stock could become more volatile and could depress possible sales of our common stock to 37shareholders who view the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock as a more attractive means of equity participation in us than owning shares of our common stock.Our common stock is subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness; the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, when issued; and any other preferred stock we may issue in the future. Our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock ranks junior to all of our and our subsidiaries’ consolidated liabilities.Shares of our common stock are equity interests that rank junior to all indebtedness and other non-equity claims on us with respect to assets available to satisfy our claims, including in a liquidation of the Company. Additionally, holders of our common stock may be subject to prior dividend and liquidation rights of any holders of our preferred stock or depositary shares representing such preferred stock then outstanding.Our common stock ranks junior to our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock with respect to the payment of dividends and amounts payable in the event of our liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of our affairs. This means that, unless accumulated dividends have been paid on all the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock then outstanding through the most recently completed dividend period, no dividends may be declared or paid on our common stock and we will not be permitted to repurchase any of our common stock, subject to limited exceptions. Likewise, in the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of our affairs, no distribution of our assets may be made to holders of our common stock until we have paid to holders of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock then outstanding a liquidation preference equal to $200.00 per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of our affairs, our assets will be available to pay obligations on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock only after all of our consolidated liabilities have been paid. In addition, the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock ranks structurally junior to all existing and future liabilities of our subsidiaries. In the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of our affairs, there may not be sufficient assets remaining, after paying our and our subsidiaries’ liabilities, to pay amounts due on any or all of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock then outstanding.As of June 30, 2020, our total consolidated indebtedness was approximately $2.3 billion, of which an aggregate of approximately $1.9 billion was secured indebtedness of ours, to which the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock would have been subordinated. In addition, we have the ability to, and may, incur additional indebtedness in the future.Our board of directors can issue, without approval of the holders of our common stock, preferred stock with voting and conversion rights that could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our common stock, the rights of holders of shares of our capital stock, or the market price of our capital stock.Our Articles of Incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue one or more additional series of preferred stock and set the terms of the preferred stock without seeking any further approval from our shareholders. Any preferred stock that is issued will rank ahead of our common stock in terms of dividends and liquidation rights. If we issue additional preferred stock, it may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Our board of directors also has the power, without shareholder approval, subject to applicable law, to set the terms of any such series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights, preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends, and other terms, or upon our liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of our affairs. If we issue additional preferred stock in the future that has a preference over our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution, or winding-up of our affairs, or if we issue additional preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock, the rights of holders of our capital stock or the market price of our capital stock could be adversely affected. The issuance of preferred stock or even the ability to issue preferred stock could also have the effect of delaying, deterring, or preventing a change of control or other corporate action.Reports published by securities or industry analysts, freelance bloggers and credit rating agencies, including projections in those reports that exceed our actual results, could adversely affect our share price and trading volume.Research analysts and freelance bloggers publish their own quarterly projections regarding our operating results. These projections may vary widely from one another and may not accurately predict the results we actually achieve. Our share price may decline if we fail to meet securities research analysts’ projections. Similarly, if one or more of the analysts who cover us change their recommendations regarding our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our share price could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, our share price or trading volume could decline.38Regulatory actions may adversely affect the trading price and liquidity of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock.Holders of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock who employ, or seek to employ, a convertible arbitrage strategy with respect to the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock may be adversely impacted by regulatory developments that may limit or restrict such a strategy. The SEC and other regulatory and self-regulatory authorities have implemented various rules and may adopt additional rules in the future that restrict and otherwise regulate short selling, over-the-counter swaps, and security-based swaps, which restrictions and regulations may adversely affect the ability of investors in, or potential purchasers of, the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock to conduct a convertible arbitrage strategy with respect to the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. This could, in turn, adversely affect the trading price and liquidity of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock.Holders of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock have no voting rights with respect to the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, except under limited circumstances.Holders of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock have no voting rights with respect to the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, except with respect to certain amendments to the terms of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, in the case of certain dividend arrearages, in certain other limited circumstances, and except as specifically required by applicable Pennsylvania law or by our amended and restated Articles of Incorporation. Holders of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock have no right to vote for any members of our board of directors, except in the case of certain dividend arrearages.If dividends on any Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock have not been declared and paid for the equivalent of six or more dividend periods (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the dividend period beginning on, and including, the initial issue date of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and ending on, but excluding, October 1, 2020), whether or not for consecutive dividend periods, the holders of such Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class with holders of all other series of preferred stock ranking equally with the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and having similar voting rights, will be entitled at our next special or annual meeting of shareholders to vote for the election of a total of two additional members of our board of directors, subject to certain limitations.We depend on our subsidiaries for cash to fund our operations and expenses, including future dividend payments with respect to the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock.A significant portion of our operations is conducted through our subsidiaries, and our ability to generate cash to meet our debt service obligations or to make future dividend payments with respect to the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock is highly dependent on the earnings and the receipt of funds from our subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries are separate legal entities that have no obligation to make any funds available to us, whether by dividends, loans, or other payments.39"
10,COHR,COHERENT INC,2019-08-16,">Item 1A.RISK FACTORS We caution our investors that our performance is subject to risks and uncertainties. The following material risk factors may cause our future results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. You should carefully consider these factors, as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K when evaluating an investment in our securities.  Investments in future markets of potential significant growth may not result in the expected return.    We continue to make investments in programs with the goal of gaining a greater share of end markets using semiconductor lasers and other components including those used for 3D sensing and emerging 5G technology. We cannot guarantee that our investments in capital and capabilities will be sufficient. The potential end markets, as well as our ability to gain market share in such markets, may not materialize on the timeline anticipated or at all. We cannot be sure of the end market price, specification or yield for products incorporating our technologies. Our technologies could fail to fulfill, partially or completely, our target customers’ specifications. We cannot guarantee the end market customers’ acceptance of our technologies. Further, we may be unable to fulfill the terms of our contracts with our target customers, which could result in penalties of a material nature, including damages, loss of market share and loss of reputation. Our competitive position depends on our ability to develop new products and processes. To meet our strategic objectives, we must develop, manufacture and market new products and continue to update our existing products and processes to keep pace with market developments to address increasingly sophisticated customer requirements. Our success in developing and selling new and enhanced products and processes depends upon a variety of factors including strategic product selection, efficient completion of product design and development, timely implementation of manufacturing and assembly processes, effective sales and marketing, and high-quality and successful product performance in the market. 21 The introduction by our competitors of products or processes using new developments better or faster than ours could render our products or processes obsolete or unmarketable. We intend to continue to make significant investments in RD&E to achieve our goals. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new products or enhancements to our existing products and processes in a manner which satisfies customer needs or achieves market acceptance. The failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business and maintain our competitive position and on our results of operations and/or financial condition. Global economic downturns may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Current and future conditions in the global economy have an inherent degree of uncertainty. As a result, it is difficult to estimate the level of growth or contraction of the global economy as a whole. It is even more difficult to estimate growth or contraction in various parts, sectors and regions of the economy, including the industrial, aerospace and defense, optical communications, telecommunications, semiconductor, and medical and life science markets in which we participate. All aspects of our company forecast depend on estimates of growth or contraction in the markets we serve. Thus, prevailing global economic uncertainties render estimates of future income and expenditures very difficult to make. Global economic downturns may affect industries in which our customers operate. These changes could include decreases in the rate of consumption or use of our customers’ products. Such conditions could have a material adverse effect on demand for our customers’ products, and in turn, on demand for our products. Adverse changes may occur in the future as a result of declining or flat global or regional economic conditions, fluctuations in currency and commodity prices, wavering confidence, capital expenditure reductions, unemployment, decline in stock markets, contraction of credit availability or other factors affecting economic conditions. For example, factors that may affect our operating results include disruption in the credit and financial markets in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, adverse effects of slowdowns in the U.S., European or Chinese economies, reductions or limited growth in consumer spending or consumer credit, global trade tariffs, and other adverse economic conditions that may be specific to the Internet, e-commerce and payments industries. Adverse changes could also occur as a result of economic upswings, such as increased wages and scarce labor pools, and increased interest rates.These changes may negatively affect sales of products and increase exposure to losses from bad debt and commodity prices, the cost and availability of financing, and costs associated with manufacturing and distributing products. Any economic downturn, or surge, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.Some systems that use our products are complex in design, and our products may contain defects that are not detected until deployed, which could increase our costs, reduce our revenues, cause us to lose key customers and may expose us to litigation arising from lawsuits related to our products. Some systems that use our products are inherently complex in design and require ongoing maintenance. Our customers may discover defects in our products after the products have been fully deployed and operated under peak stress conditions. In addition, some of our products are combined with products from other vendors which may contain defects. Should problems occur, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. If we are unable to correct defects or other problems, we could experience, among other things, loss of customers, increased costs of product returns and warranty expenses, damage to our brand reputation, failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance, diversion of development and engineering resources, or legal action by our customers.The occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.Foreign currency risk may negatively affect our revenues, cost of sales and operating margins and could result in foreign exchange losses. We conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most countries in which we operate. Our net sales outside the United States represented a majority of our total sales in each of the last three fiscal years. We incur currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a different currency from the currency in which it operates or holds assets or liabilities in a currency different than its functional currency. Changes in exchange rates can also affect our results of operations when the value of sales and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars. We cannot accurately predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations. Further, given the volatility of exchange rates, we may not be able to effectively manage our currency risks, and any volatility in currency exchange rates may increase the price of our products in local currency to our foreign customers or increase the manufacturing cost of our products, either of which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows and profitability.22  Our competitive position may still require significant investments. We continuously monitor the marketplace for strategic opportunities, and our business strategy includes expanding our product lines and markets through both internal product development and acquisitions. Consequently, we expect to continue to consider strategic acquisition of businesses, products or technologies complementary to our business. This may require significant investments of management time and financial resources. If market demand is outside our organic capabilities, if a strategic acquisition is required and we cannot identify one or execute on it, and/or if financial investments that we undertake distract management, do not result in the expected return on investment, expose us to unforeseen liabilities or jeopardize our ability to comply with our credit facility covenants due to any inability to integrate the business, adjust to operating a larger and more complex organization, adapt to additional political and other requirements associated with the acquired business, retain staff, or work with customers, we could suffer a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.We may be unable to successfully implement our acquisitions strategy or integrate acquired companies and personnel with existing operations.  We have in the past acquired several companies, and our announced acquisition of Finisar is pending. We may continue to expand and diversify our operations with additional acquisitions. We may be unable to identify or complete prospective acquisitions for many reasons, including increasing competition from other potential acquirers, the effects of consolidation in our industries, and potentially high valuations of acquisition candidates. In addition, applicable antitrust laws and other regulations may limit our ability to acquire targets or force us to divest an acquired business line. If we are unable to identify suitable targets or complete acquisitions, our growth prospects may suffer, and we may not be able to realize sufficient scale and technological advantages to compete effectively in all markets.  To the extent we are successful in making acquisitions, we may be unsuccessful in integrating acquired companies or product lines with existing operations, or the integration may be more difficult or more costly than anticipated. Some of the risks that may affect our ability to integrate or realize anticipated benefits from acquired companies, businesses or assets include those associated with:   •unexpected losses of key employees of the acquired company;   •conforming the acquired company’s standards, processes, procedures and controls with our operations, including    integrating Enterprise Resource Planning (“ERP”) systems and other key business applications;     •coordinating new product and process development;   •increasing complexity from combining operations;   •increasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations;   •difficulties in consolidating facilities and transferring processes and know-how; and   •diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns.  In connection with acquisitions, we may:   •use a signification portion of our available cash;   •issue equity securities, which would dilute current shareholders’ percentage ownership;  •incur significant debt;  •incur or assume contingent liabilities, known or unknown, including potential lawsuits, infringement actions or similar  liabilities;   •incur impairment charges related to goodwill or other intangibles; and   •face antitrust or other regulatory inquiries or actions.  In addition, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected if the effect of any acquisitions on our consolidated financial results is dilutive or is below the market's or financial analysts' expectations, or if there are unanticipated changes in the business or financial performance of the target company or the combined company. Any failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses may disrupt our business and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. 23  Our future success depends on continued international sales, and our global operations are complex, and present multiple challenges to manage. Sales to customers in countries other than the United States accounted for approximately 70%, 68% and 69% of revenues during the years ended June 30, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. If we do not maintain our current volume of international sales, we could suffer a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition.  We manufacture products in the United States, China, Singapore, Vietnam, the Philippines, Germany, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, and through a contract manufacturer in Thailand. We also maintain direct sales offices in Hong Kong, Japan, Germany, China, Switzerland, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Italy, South Korea, and Taiwan. Our operations vary by location and are influenced on a location-by-location basis by local customs, languages and work practices, as well as different local weather conditions, management styles and education systems. In addition, multiple complex issues may arise concurrently in different countries, potentially hampering our management’s ability to respond in an effective and timely manner. Any inability to respond in an effective and timely manner to issues in our global operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We are subject to complex and rapidly changing import and export regulations.               We are subject to the passage of and changes in the interpretation of regulation by U.S. government entities at the federal, state and local levels and non-U.S. agencies, including, but not limited to, the following:            •We are required to comply with import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our ability to enter into or complete transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies. We may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item, and granting of a required license cannot be assured. Compliance with the import laws that apply to our businesses may restrict our access to, and may increase the cost of obtaining, certain products and could interrupt our supply of imported inventory. •Exported technologies necessary to develop and manufacture certain products are subject to U.S. export control laws and similar laws of other jurisdictions. We may be subject to adverse regulatory consequences, including government oversight of facilities and export transactions, monetary penalties and other sanctions for violations of these laws. In certain instances, these regulations may prohibit the Company from developing or manufacturing certain of its products for specific applications outside the United States. Failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation. Changes in U.S. trade policies could impact the Company’s international operations and the cost of goods imported into the United States, which may narrow the size of our markets, materially impact our revenues or increase our operating costs and expose us to contract litigation. In March 2018, President Trump announced new steel and aluminum tariffs, in April 2018, the U.S. Department of Commerce issued a denial order against two companies in the telecommunications market, and in May 2019, the U.S. Department of Commerce placed Huawei and its affiliates on the U.S. Entity List. Other international trade actions and initiatives also have been implemented, notably the imposition by the U.S. of additional tariffs on products of Chinese origin, and China’s imposition of additional tariffs on U.S.-origin goods. If we cannot obtain relief from, or if we cannot take other action to mitigate the impact of, these additional restrictions and duties, our business and profits may be materially and adversely affected. Further changes in the trade policy of the United States or of other countries with which we do cross-border business, or additional sanctions, could result in retaliatory actions by other countries that could materially and negatively impact the volume of economic activity in the United States or globally, which, in turn, may decrease our access to customers and markets, reduce our revenues, and increase our operating costs.Exports of certain of our products are subject to export controls imposed by the U.S. Government and administered by the U.S. Departments of State and Commerce. In certain instances, these regulations may require pre-shipment authorization from the administering department. For products subject to the Export Administration Regulations, or EAR, administered by the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security, the requirement for a license is dependent on the type and end use of the product, the final destination, the identity of the end user and whether a license exception might apply. Virtually all exports of products subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, or ITAR, administered by the Department of State's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, require a license. Certain of our fiber optics products are subject to EAR controls and we historically have sold some 24 products, including certain products developed with government funding, subject to ITAR. Products developed and manufactured in our foreign locations are subject to export controls of the applicable foreign nation.  Given the current global political climate, obtaining export licenses can be difficult and time-consuming. Failure to obtain export licenses for these shipments, or having one or more of our customers be restricted from receiving exports from us, could significantly reduce our revenue and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Compliance with regulations of the United States and other governments also subjects us to additional fees and costs. The absence of comparable restrictions on competitors in other countries may adversely affect our competitive position.  We have previously been the subject of inquiries from the Department of State and the Department of Justice regarding compliance with ITAR. Although these inquiries were closed with no action being taken, we expended significant time and resources to resolve them, and future inquiries of this type could also be costly to resolve. Any inability to access financial markets from time to time to raise required capital, finance our working capital requirements or our acquisition strategies, or otherwise to support our liquidity needs could negatively impact our ability to finance our operations, meet certain obligations or implement our growth strategy. We borrow under our existing credit facilities to fund operations, including working capital investments, and to finance our acquisition strategies. In the past, market disruptions experienced in the United States and abroad have materially impacted liquidity in the credit and debt markets, making financing terms for borrowers less attractive, and, in certain cases, have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of financing. Uncertainty in the financial markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing or to refinance our existing credit facilities or existing debt arrangements on favorable terms or at all, which could negatively affect our ability to fund current and future expansion as well as future acquisitions and development. These disruptions may include turmoil in the financial services industry, volatility in the markets where our outstanding securities trade, and changes in general economic conditions in the areas where we do business. If we are unable to access funds at competitive rates, or if our short-term or long-term borrowing costs increase, our ability to finance our operations, meet our short-term obligations and implement our operating strategies could be adversely affected. In the future we may be required to raise additional capital through public or private financing or other arrangements. Such financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and our failure to raise capital when needed could harm our business and prospects. Additional equity financing may be dilutive to the holders of our common stock, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to undertake certain activities that we otherwise would find to be desirable. Further, debt service obligations associated with any debt financing could reduce our profitability. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to grow our business or respond to competitive pressures. We may not be able to settle conversions of our convertible senior notes in cash or repurchase the notes in accordance with their terms. Holders of our outstanding convertible senior notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the notes) at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, upon conversion of the notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversions (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of surrendered notes, or pay cash with respect to notes being converted.  In addition, our ability to repurchase or to pay cash upon conversion of the notes may be limited by law, regulatory authority or agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the governing indenture, or to pay any cash upon conversion of the notes as required would constitute a default under the indenture. A default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself also could lead to a default under agreements governing our credit facility and any of our future indebtedness. If the payment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the notes or to pay cash upon conversion of the notes. We may fail to accurately estimate the size and growth of our markets and our customers’ demands.   We make significant decisions based on our estimates of customer requirements. We use our estimates to determine the levels of business we seek and accept, production schedules, personnel needs and other resource requirements. 25 Customers may require rapid increases in production on short notice. We may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or allocate sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet such increases in demand. Rapid customer ramp-up and significant increases in demand may strain our resources or negatively affect our margins. Inability to satisfy customer demand in a timely manner may harm our reputation, reduce our other opportunities, damage our relationships with customers, reduce revenue growth, and/or incur contractual penalties. Alternatively, downturns in the industries in which we compete may cause our customers to significantly reduce their demand. With respect to orders we initiate with our suppliers to address anticipated demand from our customers, certain suppliers may have required non-cancelable purchase commitments or advance payments from us, and those obligations and commitments could reduce our ability to adjust our inventory or expense levels to reflect declining market demands. Unexpected declines in customer demands can result in excess or obsolete inventory and additional charges. Because certain of our sales, research and development, and internal manufacturing overhead expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in customer demand likely would decrease our gross margins and operating income. We may encounter increased competition. We may encounter substantial competition from other companies in the same market, including established companies with significant resources. Some of our competitors may have financial, technical, marketing or other capabilities that are more extensive than ours. They may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and other competitive pressures. We may not be able to compete successfully against our present or future competitors. Our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. There are limitations on the protection of our intellectual property and we may from time to time be involved in costly intellectual property litigation or indemnification. We rely on a combination of trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws, combined with employee confidentiality, noncompetition and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance that the steps we take will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or intellectual property. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future. Asserting our intellectual property rights or defending against third-party claims could involve substantial expense. In the event a third-party were successful in a claim that one of our processes infringed its proprietary rights, we could be required to pay substantial damages or royalties, or spend substantial amounts in order to obtain a license or modify processes so that they no longer infringe such proprietary rights. Any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. A significant portion of our business is dependent on cyclical industries.        Our business is dependent on the demand for products produced by end-users of industrial lasers, optical communication products, components for semiconductor capital equipment, and components for 3D sensing. Many of these end-users are in industries that have historically experienced a highly cyclical demand for their products. As a result, demand for our products is subject to these cyclical fluctuations. Fluctuations in demand could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Our global operations are subject to complex legal and regulatory requirements.       We manufacture products in the United States, China, Singapore, Vietnam, the Philippines, Germany, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, and through a contract manufacturer in Thailand. We also maintain direct sales offices in Hong Kong, Japan, Germany, China, Switzerland, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Italy, South Korea and Taiwan. Operations inside and outside of the United States are subject to many legal and regulatory requirements, some of which are not aligned with others. These include tariffs, quotas, taxes and other market barriers, restrictions on the export or import of technology, potentially limited intellectual property protection,  import and export requirements and restrictions, anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, foreign investment rules and regulations, data privacy requirements, competition laws, employment and labor laws, pensions and social insurance, and environmental health and safety laws and regulations. 26 Compliance with these laws and regulations can be onerous and expensive, and requirements differ among jurisdictions. New laws, changes in existing laws, and abrogation of local regulations by national laws may result in significant uncertainties in how they will be interpreted and enforced. Failure to comply with any of these foreign laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.Changes in laws and regulations governing data privacy and data protection could have a material adverse impact on our business. We are subject to many data privacy, data protection, and data breach notification laws, including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective in May of 2018. While we have taken measures to assess the requirements of, and to comply with, the GDPR, as well as new and existing data-related laws and regulations of other jurisdictions, these measures may be challenged, including by authorities that regulate data-related compliance. We could incur significant expense in facilitating and responding to investigations, and if the measures we have taken prove to be inadequate, we could face fines, penalties or damages, and incur reputational harm, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.Data breach incidents and breakdown of information and communication technologies could disrupt our operations and impact our financial results. In the course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property (both our own and that of our customers), as well as proprietary business information. We could be subject to service outages or breaches of security systems which may result in disruption, unauthorized access, misappropriation, or corruption of this information. Security breaches of our network or data, including physical or electronic break-ins, vendor service outages, computer viruses, attacks by hackers or similar breaches can create system disruptions, shutdowns, and unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. If we are unable to prevent or contain such security or privacy breaches, our operations could be disrupted or we could suffer legal claims, loss of reputation, financial loss, property damage, or regulatory penalties.We have entered into supply agreements which commit us to supply products on specified terms. We have supply agreements with some customers which require us to supply products and to allocate sufficient capacity to make these products. We have also agreed to pricing schedules and methodologies which could result in penalties if we fail to meet development, supply, capacity and quality commitments. Failure to do so may cause us to be unable to generate the amount of revenue or the level of profitability we expect from these arrangements. Our ability to realize a profit under some of these agreements will be subject to the level of customer demand, the cost of maintaining facilities and manufacturing capacity, and supply chain capability. If we fail to fulfill our commitments under these supply agreements, our business, after using all remedies available, financial conditions and results of operations may suffer a material adverse effect. We depend on highly complex manufacturing processes that require feeder materials, components and products from limited sources of supply.     Our operations are dependent upon a supply chain of difficult-to-make or difficult-to-refine products and materials. Some of our product inflow is subject to yield reductions from growth or fabrication losses, and thus the quantities we may receive are not consistently predictable. Customers may also change the specification for a product that our suppliers cannot meet. We also make products for which the Company is one of the world’s largest suppliers. We use high-quality, optical grade ZnSe in the production of many of our IR optical products. We are a leading producer of zinc selenide (“ZnSe”) for our internal use and for external sale. The production of ZnSe is a complex process requiring a highly controlled environment. A number of factors, including defective or contaminated materials, could adversely affect our ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields of high quality ZnSe. Lack of adequate availability of high quality ZnSe could have a material adverse effect upon our business. There can be no assurance that we will not experience manufacturing yield inefficiencies which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We produce hydrogen selenide gas which is used in our production of ZnSe. There are risks inherent in the production and handling of such material. Our lack of proper handling of hydrogen selenide could require us to curtail our production of hydrogen selenide. Our potential inability to internally produce hydrogen selenide could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 27 In addition, we produce and use other high purity and relatively uncommon materials and compounds to manufacture our products including, but not limited to, zinc sulfide (“ZnS”), gallium arsenide (“GaAs”), Yttrium Aluminum Garnet (“YAG”), Yttrium Lithium Fluoride (“YLF”), Calcium Fluoride, Germanium, Selenium, Telluride, Bismuth Telluride (“Bi2Te3”) and silicon carbide (“SiC”). A significant failure of our internal production processes or our suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of these necessary materials on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Increases in commodity prices may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.  We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of increases in commodity prices. Our businesses purchase, produce and sell high-purity selenium and other raw materials based upon quoted market prices from minor metal exchanges. The negative impact from increases in commodity prices might not be recovered through our product sales which could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings and financial condition. We use and generate potentially hazardous substances that are subject to stringent environmental regulations. Hazardous substances used or generated in some of our research and manufacturing facilities are subject to stringent environmental regulation. We believe that our handling of such substances is in material compliance with applicable local, state and federal environmental, safety and health regulations at each operating location. We invest substantially in proper personal protective equipment, process controls, including monitoring and specialized training to minimize risks to employees, surrounding communities and the environment that could result from the presence and handling of such hazardous substances. When exposure problems or potential exposure problems have been uncovered, corrective actions have been implemented and re-occurrence has been minimal or non-existent. We have in place an emergency response plan with respect to our generation and use of the hazardous substances Hydrogen Selenide, Hydrogen Sulfide, Arsine and Phosphine. Special attention has been given to all procedures pertaining to these gaseous materials to minimize the chances of its accidental release into the atmosphere. With respect to the manufacturing, use, storage and disposal of the low-level radioactive material Thorium Fluoride, our facilities and procedures have been inspected and licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Thorium-bearing by-products are collected and shipped as solid waste to a government-approved low-level radioactive waste disposal site in Clive, Utah. The generation, use, collection, storage and disposal of all other hazardous by-products, such as suspended solids containing heavy metals or airborne particulates, are believed by us to be in material compliance with regulations. We believe that we have obtained all of the permits and licenses required for operation of our business. Although we do not know of any material environmental, safety or health problems in our properties or processes or products, there can be no assurance that problems will not develop in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.Unfavorable changes in tax rates, tax liabilities or tax accounting rules could negatively affect future results. As a global company, we are subject to taxation in the United States and various other countries and jurisdictions. As such, we must exercise a level of judgment in determining our worldwide tax liabilities. Our future tax rates could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in countries with differing tax rates or changes in tax laws. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significantly adverse impact on our effective tax rate. The enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) in December 2017 significantly affected U.S. tax law by changing how the U.S. imposes tax on multinational corporations. The U.S. Department of Treasury has broad authority under the Tax Act to issue regulations and interpretive guidance. We have applied available guidance to estimate our tax obligations, but new guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department may cause us to make adjustments to our tax estimates in future periods. In addition, we are subject to regular examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provision and accruals, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operation or financial condition. 28 Natural disasters or other global or regional catastrophic events could disrupt our operations, give rise to substantial environmental hazards and adversely affect our results.                       We may be exposed to business interruptions due to catastrophe, natural disaster, pandemic, terrorism or acts of war that are beyond our control. Disruptions to our facilities or systems, or to those of our key suppliers, could also interrupt operational processes and adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products and provide services and support to our customers. As a result, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Our success depends on our ability to attract, retain and develop key personnel and requires continued good relations with our employees.We are highly dependent upon the experience and continuing services of certain scientists, engineers, production and management personnel. Competition for the services of these personnel is intense. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain or attract the personnel necessary for our success. The loss of the services of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Our stock price has been volatile in the past and may be volatile in the future.The market price for our common stock on The Nasdaq Global Select Market varied between a high of $50.75 and a low of $29.31 in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. We expect that this volatility will continue. Factors that could cause fluctuation in our stock price include, among other things, general economic and market conditions, actual or anticipated variations in operating results, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts, our inability to meet or exceed securities analysts’ estimates or expectations, conditions or trends in the industries in which our products are purchased, announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, divestitures, joint ventures or other strategic initiatives, capital commitments, additions or departures of key personnel, sales of our common stock or equity-linked securities and issuance of shares of our common stock in connection with conversions of our outstanding convertible senior notes. Many of these factors are beyond our control. However, these factors could cause the market price of our common stock to decline, regardless of our actual operating performance. In addition, in recent years, the stock market in general, and The Nasdaq Stock Market and the securities of technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies. These broad market fluctuations have in the past, and may in the future, materially and adversely affect our stock price, regardless of our operating results. This volatility may affect the price at which our shareholders can sell our common stock. Some anti-takeover provisions contained in our articles of incorporation and by-laws, as well as provisions of Pennsylvania law, could impair a takeover attempt, which could also reduce the market price of our common stock. Our articles of incorporation and by-laws contain provisions that could make us a less attractive target for a hostile takeover and could make more difficult or discourage a merger proposal, a tender offer or a proxy contest. Such provisions include: •A requirement that shareholder-nominated director nominees be nominated in advance of the meeting at which directors are elected and that specific information be provided in connection with such nomination; •The ability of our board of directors to issue additional shares of common stock or preferred stock without shareholder approval; and •Certain provisions requiring supermajority approval (at least two-thirds of the votes cast by all shareholders entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class).In addition, the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law (the “BCL”) contains provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us or changes in our management. Many of these provisions are triggered if any person or group acquires, or discloses the intent to acquire, 20% or more of a corporation’s voting power, subject to certain exceptions. These provisions: •provide the other shareholders of the corporation with certain rights against the acquiring group or person; •prohibit the corporation from engaging in a broad range of business combinations with the acquiring group or person; •restrict the voting and other rights of the acquiring group or person; and •provide that certain profits realized by the acquiring group or person from the sale of our equity securities belong to and are recoverable by us.29 Regardless of the amount of a person’s holdings, if a shareholder or shareholder group (including affiliated persons) would be a party to certain proposed transactions with us or would be treated differently from other shareholders of ours in certain proposed transactions, the BCL requires approval by a majority of votes entitled to be cast by all shareholders other than the interested shareholder or affiliate group, unless the transaction is approved by independent directors or other criteria are satisfied. Furthermore, under the BCL, a “short-form” merger of II-VI cannot be implemented without the consent of our board of directors.In addition, as permitted by Pennsylvania law, an amendment to our articles of incorporation or other corporate action that is approved by shareholders may provide mandatory special treatment for specified groups of non-consenting shareholders of the same class. For example, an amendment to our articles of incorporation or other corporate action may provide that shares of common stock held by designated shareholders of record must be cashed out at a price determined by the corporation, subject to applicable dissenters’ rights.Furthermore, the BCL provides that directors may, in discharging their duties, consider, to the extent they deem appropriate, the effects of any action upon shareholders, employees, suppliers, customers and the communities in which its offices are located. Directors are not required to consider the interests of shareholders to a greater degree than other constituencies’ interests. The BCL expressly provides that directors do not violate their fiduciary duties solely by relying on “poison pills” or the anti-takeover provisions of the BCL. We do not currently have a “poison pill.”All of these provisions may limit the price that investors may be willing to pay for shares of our common stock. Because we do not currently intend to pay dividends, holders of our common stock will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value, and by the intended anti-dilution actions of our share-buyback program.We have never declared or paid dividends on our common stock, and do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We currently anticipate that we will retain any future earnings to support operations and to finance the development of our business. As a result, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon future appreciation in its value. There is no guarantee that our common stock will maintain its value or appreciate in value.We contract with a number of large end-user service providers and product companies that have considerable bargaining power, which may require us to agree to terms and conditions that could have an adverse effect on our business or ability to recognize revenues.  Large end-user service providers and product companies comprise a significant portion of our customer base. These customers generally have greater purchasing power than smaller entities and, accordingly, often request and receive more favorable terms from suppliers, including us. As we seek to expand our sales to existing customers and acquire new customers, we may be required to agree to terms and conditions that are favorable to our customers and that may affect the timing of our ability to recognize revenue, increase our costs and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Furthermore, large customers have increased buying power and ability to require onerous terms in our contracts with them, including pricing, warranties, and indemnification terms. If we are unable to satisfy the terms of these contracts, it could result in liabilities of a material nature, including litigation, damages, additional costs, loss of market share and loss of reputation. Additionally, the terms these large customers require, such as most-favored customer or exclusivity provisions, may impact our ability to do business with other customers and generate revenues from such customers.   We may be adversely affected by climate change regulations. In many of the countries in which we operate, government bodies are increasingly enacting legislation and regulations in response to potential impacts of climate change. These laws and regulations may be mandatory. They have the potential to impact our operations directly or indirectly as a result of required compliance by our customers or our supply chain. Inconsistency of regulations may also affect the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations. Assessments of the potential impact of future climate change legislation, regulation and international treaties and accords are uncertain, given the wide scope of potential regulatory change in countries in which we operate. We may incur increased capital expenditures resulting from required compliance with revised or new legislation or regulations, added costs to purchase or lower profits from sales of our products, allowances or credits under a “cap and trade” system, increased insurance premiums and deductibles as new actuarial tables are developed to reshape coverage, a change in competitive position relative to industry peers, and changes to profit or loss arising from increased or decreased demand for goods produced by us and indirectly, from changes in costs of goods sold. 30 We depend on large purchases from a few significant customers, and any loss, cancellation, reduction or delay in purchases by these customers could harm our business.                             A small number of customers have consistently accounted for a significant portion of our revenues, although none individually greater than 10% of total revenues. Our success will depend on our continued ability to develop and manage relationships with our major customers. Although we are attempting to expand our customer base, we expect that significant customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future. We may not be able to offset any decline in revenues from our existing major customers with revenues from new customers, and our quarterly results may be volatile because we are dependent on large orders from these customers that may be reduced, delayed, or cancelled.  The markets in which we have historically sold our optical subsystems and components products are dominated by a relatively small number of systems manufacturers, thereby limiting the number of our potential customers. Our dependence on large orders from a relatively small number of customers makes our relationship with each customer critically important to our business. We cannot ensure that we will be able to retain our major customers, attract additional customers, or that our customers will be successful in selling their products that incorporate our products. We have in the past experienced delays and reductions in orders from some of our major customers. In addition, our customers have in the past sought price concessions from us, and we expect that they will continue to do so in the future. Expense reduction measures that we have implemented over the past several years, and additional action we are taking to reduce costs, may adversely affect our ability to introduce new and improved products which may, in turn, adversely affect our relationships with some of our key customers. Further, some of our customers may in the future shift their purchases of products from us to our competitors or to joint ventures between these customers and our competitors, or may in certain circumstances produce competitive products themselves. The loss of one or more of our major customers, any reduction or delay in sales to these customers, our inability to successfully develop relationships with additional customers, or future price concessions that we may make could significantly harm our business.  The manufacturing of our products may be adversely affected if we are unable to manufacture certain products in our manufacturing facilities.  We manufacture some of the components that we provide to our contract manufacturer, along with our own finished goods. For some of the components and finished goods we are the sole manufacturer. Our manufacturing processes are highly complex, and issues are often difficult to detect and correct. From time to time we have experienced problems achieving acceptable yields in our manufacturing facilities, resulting in delays in the availability of our products. In addition, if we experience problems with our manufacturing facilities, it would be costly and require a long period of time to move the manufacture of these components and finished good products to a different facility or contract manufacturer, which could result in interruptions in supply, and would likely materially impact our financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, for a variety of reasons, including changes in circumstances at our contract manufacturers or our own business strategies, we may be required to, or voluntarily may, transfer the manufacturing of certain products to other manufacturing sites. Changes in manufacturing processes are often required due to changes in product specifications, changing customer needs and the introduction of new products. These changes may reduce manufacturing yields at our contract manufacturers and at our own manufacturing facilities, resulting in reduced margins on those products. In addition, many of our products are sourced from suppliers based outside of the United States, primarily in Asia. Uncertainty with respect to tax and trade policies, tariffs and government regulations affecting trade between the United States and other countries has recently increased. Major developments in tax policy or trade relations, such as the imposition of tariffs on imported products, could increase our product and product-related costs or require us to seek alternative suppliers, either of which could result in decreased sales or increases product and product-related costs.  Failure to accurately forecast our revenues could result in additional charges for obsolete or excess inventories or non-cancelable purchase commitments. We base many of our operating decisions, and enter into purchase commitments, on the basis of anticipated revenue trends which are highly unpredictable. Some of our purchase commitments are not cancelable, and in some cases we are required to recognize a charge representing the amount of material or capital equipment purchased or ordered, which exceeds our actual requirements. Should revenues in future periods fall substantially below our expectations, or should we fail to accurately forecast changes in demand mix, we could be required to record substantial charges for obsolete or excess inventories or non-cancelable purchase commitments 31 If we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired. As a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and Nasdaq listing requirements. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources, including accounting-related costs and significant management oversight.  Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement, could cause us to delay reporting of our financial results, be subject to one or more investigations or enforcement actions by state or federal regulatory agencies, stockholder lawsuits or other adverse actions requiring us to incur defense costs, pay fines, settlements or judgments. Any such failures could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock. In addition, if we are unable to continue to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the Nasdaq stock market. Risks Relating to the MergerAlthough II-VI expects that its acquisition of Finisar will result in cost savings, synergies and other benefits, the combined company may not realize those benefits because of integration difficulties and other challenges.The success of II-VI’s acquisition of Finisar will depend in large part on the success of the management of the combined company in integrating the operations, strategies, technologies and personnel of the two companies following the completion of the Merger. The combined company may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the Merger if the integration process takes longer than expected or is more costly than expected. The failure of the combined company to meet the challenges involved in successfully integrating the operations of the two companies or to otherwise realize any of the anticipated benefits of the Merger, including additional cost savings and synergies, could impair the operations of the combined company. In addition, II-VI anticipates that the overall integration of Finisar will be a time-consuming and expensive process that, without proper planning and effective and timely implementation, could significantly disrupt the combined company’s business.Potential difficulties the combined company may encounter in the integration process include the following: •the integration of management teams, strategies, technologies and operations, products and services; •the disruption of ongoing businesses and distraction of their respective management teams from ongoing business concerns; •the retention of and possible decrease in business from the existing customers of both companies; •the creation of uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems; •the reduction of the costs associated with each company’s operations; •the integration of corporate cultures and maintenance of employee morale; •the retention of key employees; and •potential unknown liabilities associated with the Merger.The anticipated cost savings, synergies and other benefits of the Merger assume a successful integration of the companies and are based on projections and other assumptions, which are inherently uncertain. Even if integration is successful, anticipated cost savings, synergies and other benefits may not be achieved.II-VI and Finisar will incur significant transaction-related costs in connection with the Merger.II-VI and Finisar expect to incur a number of non-recurring transaction-related costs associated with completing the Merger, combining the operations of the two companies and achieving desired synergies. These fees and costs will be significant. Non-recurring transaction costs include, but are not limited to, fees paid to legal, financial and accounting advisors, filing fees and printing costs. II-VI will incur significant costs with respect to the financing for the cash consideration to be paid in connection with the Merger. Additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration of the businesses of II-VI and Finisar. There can be no assurance that the elimination of certain duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the two businesses, will offset the incremental transaction-related costs over time. Thus, any net benefit may not be achieved in the near term, the long term or at all.32 Our pending acquisition of Finisar is subject to conditions, including certain conditions that may not be satisfied, and may not be completed on a timely basis, or at all. Failure to complete the Merger could have material and adverse effects on us.The completion of the Merger is subject to a number of conditions, which make the completion and timing of the completion of the Merger uncertain. Also, either Finisar or II-VI may terminate the Merger Agreement if the Merger has not been completed by November 8, 2019, although this termination right is not available if failure to comply with the Merger Agreement is a principal cause of or results in the failure of the Merger to occur before November 8, 2019.If the Merger is not completed on a timely basis, or at all, II-VI’s and Finisar’s respective ongoing businesses may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the Merger, II-VI and Finisar will be subject to a number of risks, including the following: •II-VI and Finisar will be required to pay certain costs relating to the Merger, whether or not the Merger is completed, such as legal, accounting, financial advisor and printing fees; •under the Merger Agreement, each of II-VI and Finisar is subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of its business prior to completing the Merger, which may adversely affect its ability to execute certain of its business strategies; •time and resources committed by II-VI’s and Finisar’s respective management to matters relating to the Merger could otherwise have been devoted to pursuing other beneficial opportunities; and •the market price of II-VI Common Stock could decline below current market prices to the extent that such current market prices reflect a market assumption that the Merger will be completed.In addition, if the Merger is not completed, II-VI may experience negative reactions from the financial markets and from its customers and employees. II-VI could also be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the Merger or to enforcement proceedings commenced against II-VI to perform its obligations under the Merger Agreement. If the Merger is not completed, II-VI cannot assure its shareholders that the risks described above will not materialize and will not adversely affect the business, financial results and stock prices of II-VI.Each of II-VI and Finisar is subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Merger is pending, which could adversely affect each of Finisar’s and II-VI’s business and operations.Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Finisar and II-VI are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of their respective business prior to completing the Merger, which may adversely affect each party’s ability to execute certain of its business strategies. Such limitations could negatively affect each party’s businesses and operations prior to the completion of the Merger. Furthermore, the process of planning to integrate two businesses and organizations for the post-Merger period can divert management attention and resources and could ultimately have an adverse effect on each of Finisar and II-VI.In connection with the Merger, parties with which Finisar or II-VI does business may experience uncertainty associated with the Merger, including with respect to current or future business relationships with Finisar, II-VI or the combined business. It is possible that some customers, suppliers and other persons with whom Finisar or II-VI has a business relationship may delay or defer certain business decisions or might decide to seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationships with Finisar or II-VI, as applicable, as a result of the Merger, which could negatively affect Finisar’s or II-VI’s revenues, earnings and cash flows, as well as the market price of shares of II-VI Common Stock, regardless of whether the Merger is completed.The market price of II-VI Common Stock may decline in the future as a result of the Merger.  The market price of II-VI Common Stock may decline in the future as a result of the Merger for a number of reasons, including:  •the unsuccessful integration of Finisar and II-VI (including for the reasons set forth in the preceding risk factor);  •the need to pay cash amounts owing on conversion of, or in respect of any demands for repurchase of, Finisar’s outstanding convertible notes in connection with the Merger and to issue II-VI Common Stock in connection with any future conversion of the Finisar’s outstanding convertible notes, which may cause substantial dilution to holders of II-VI Common Stock; and  •the failure of the combined company to achieve the perceived benefits of the Merger, including financial results, as rapidly as or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts. These factors are, to some extent, beyond the control of II-VI. As a consequence, II-VI shareholders could lose the value of their investment in II-VI Common Stock. 33 "
0,COHR,COHERENT INC,2018-08-28,">Item 1A.RISK FACTORS We caution our investors that our performance is subject to risks and uncertainties. The following material risk factors may cause our future results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. You should carefully consider these factors, as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K when evaluating an investment in our securities. Investments in Future Markets of Potential Significant Growth May Not Result in Expected Returns We have initiated investment programs with the goal of gaining a greater share of end markets using semiconductor lasers and other components including those used for 3D sensing.  We cannot guarantee that our investments in capital and capabilities will be sufficient.  The potential end markets, as well as our ability to gain market share in such markets, may not materialize on the timeline anticipated or at all.  We cannot be sure of the end market price, specification or yield for products incorporating our technologies. Our technologies could fail to fulfill, partially or completely our target customers’ finalized specifications.  We cannot guarantee the end market customers’ acceptance of our technologies. Further, we may be unable to fulfill the terms of our contracts with our target customers, which could result in penalties of a material nature, including consequential damages, loss of market share and loss of reputation.Our Competitive Position Depends on Our Ability to Develop New Products and Processes To meet our strategic objectives, we must develop, manufacture and market new products and continue to update our existing products and processes to keep pace with market developments to address increasingly sophisticated customer requirements. Our success in developing and selling new and enhanced products and processes depends upon a variety of factors including strategic product selection, efficient completion of product design and development, timely implementation of manufacturing and assembly processes, effective sales and marketing, high-quality and successful product performance in the market. The introduction by our competitors of products or processes using new developments better or faster than ours could render our products or processes obsolete or unmarketable.  We intend to continue to make significant investments in RD&E to achieve our goals.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new products or enhancements to our existing products and processes in a manner which satisfies customer needs or achieves market acceptance. The failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business and maintain our competitive position and on our results of operations and/or financial condition.  Our Competitive Position May Still Require Significant Investments We continuously monitor the marketplace for strategic opportunities, and our business strategy includes expanding our product lines and markets through both internal product development and acquisitions.  Consequently, we expect to continue to consider strategic acquisition of businesses, products or technologies complementary to our business.  This may require significant investments of management time and financial resources.  If market demand is outside our organic capabilities, if a strategic acquisition is required and we cannot identify one or execute on it, and/or if financial investments that we undertake distract management, do not result in the expected return on investment, expose us to unforeseen liabilities or jeopardize our ability to comply with our credit facility covenants due to any inability to integrate the business, adjust to operating a larger and more complex organization, adapt to additional political and other requirements associated with the acquired business, retain staff, or work with the customers or otherwise we could suffer a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.Our Future Success Depends on Continued International Sales, and Our Global Operations are Complex, and Present Multiple Challenges to ManageSales to customers in countries other than the United States accounted for approximately 68%, 69% and 63% of revenues during the years ended June 30, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. If we do not maintain our current volume of international sales, we could suffer a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. We manufacture products in the United States, China, Singapore, Vietnam, the Philippines, Germany, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom and through a contract manufacturer in Thailand.  We also maintain direct sales offices in Hong Kong, Japan, Germany, China, Switzerland, Belgium, the United Kingdom, China, Italy, South Korea, and Taiwan.  Our operations vary by location and are influenced on a location-by-location basis by local customs, languages and work practices, as well as different local weather conditions, management styles and education systems. In addition, multiple complex issues may arise concurrently in different countries, potentially hampering our management’s ability to respond in an effective and timely manner. Any inability to respond in an effective and timely manner to issues in our global operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 18 Foreign Currency Risk May Negatively Affect our Revenues, Cost of Sales and Operating Margins and Could Result in Foreign Exchange Losses  We conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most countries in which we operate. Our net sales outside the United States represented a majority of our total sales in each of the last three fiscal years. We incur currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a different currency from the currency in which it operates or holds assets or liabilities in a currency different than its functional currency. Changes in exchange rates can also affect our results of operations when the value of sales and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars. We cannot accurately predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations. Further, given the volatility of exchange rates, we may not be able to effectively manage our currency risks, and any volatility in currency exchange rates may increase the price of our products in local currency to our foreign customers or increase the manufacturing cost of our products, either of which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows and profitability.Any Inability to Access Financial Markets from Time to Time to Raise Required Capital, Finance Our Working Capital Requirements or Our Acquisition Strategies, or Otherwise to Support our Liquidity Needs Could Negatively Impact our Ability to Finance our Operations, Meet Certain Obligations or Implement our Growth Strategy  We occasionally borrow under our existing credit facilities to fund operations, including working capital investments, and to finance our acquisition strategies. In the past, market disruptions experienced in the United States and abroad have materially impacted liquidity in the credit and debt markets, making financing terms for borrowers less attractive, and, in certain cases, have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of financing. Uncertainty in the financial markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing or to refinance our existing credit facilities or existing debt arrangements on favorable terms or at all, which could negatively affect our ability to fund current and future expansion as well as future acquisitions and development. These disruptions may include turmoil in the financial services industry, volatility in the markets where our outstanding securities trade, and general economic downturns in the areas where we do business. If we are unable to access funds at competitive rates, or if our short-term or long-term borrowing costs increase, our ability to finance our operations, meet our short-term obligations and implement our operating strategies could be adversely affected.   In the future we may be required to raise additional capital through public or private financing or other arrangements. Such financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and our failure to raise capital when needed could harm our business and prospects. Additional equity financing may be dilutive to the holders of our common stock, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to undertake certain operational activities that we otherwise would find to be desirable. Further, debt service obligations associated with any such debt financing could reduce our profitability. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to grow our business or respond to competitive pressures.We May Incur Substantially More Indebtedness We and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, including secured indebtedness, subject to the restrictions contained in our debt instruments.  We are not restricted under the terms of the indenture governing our outstanding convertible senior notes from incurring additional indebtedness, securing existing or future indebtedness, recapitalizing our debt obligations or taking a number of other actions that are not limited by the terms of the indenture.  Our credit facility currently restricts our ability to incur additional indebtedness, including secured indebtedness, but if our credit facility matures or is repaid, we may not be subject to such restrictions under the terms of any subsequent indebtedness. We May Not Be Able to Settle Conversions of Our Convertible Senior Notes in Cash or to Repurchase the Notes in Accordance with Their Terms Holders of our outstanding convertible senior notes have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change (as defined in the indenture governing the notes) at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.  In addition, upon conversion of the notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversions (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the notes being converted. However, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make repurchases of notes surrendered therefor or pay cash with respect to notes being converted. In addition, our ability to repurchase or to pay cash upon conversion of the notes may be limited by law, regulatory authority or agreements governing our future indebtedness.  Our failure to repurchase notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the governing indenture or to pay any cash upon conversion of the notes as required would constitute a default under the indenture. A default under the indenture or the fundamental change itself also could lead to a default under agreements governing our credit facility and any of our future indebtedness.  If the payment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and repurchase the notes or to pay cash upon conversion of the notes.19 The Conditional Conversion Feature of Our Outstanding Convertible Senior Notes, if Triggered, May Adversely Affect Our Financial Condition and Operating Results In the event the conditional conversion feature of the notes is triggered, holders of notes will be entitled to convert the notes at any time during specified periods at their option.  If one or more holders elect to convert their notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. We May Fail to Accurately Estimate the Size and Growth of Our Markets and Our Customers’ DemandsWe make significant decisions based on our estimates of customer requirements.  We use our estimates to determine the levels of business we seek and accept, production schedules, personnel needs and other resource requirements.Customers may require rapid increases in production on short notice.  We may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or allocate sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet such increases in demand. Rapid customer ramp-up and significant increases in demand may strain our resources or negatively affect our margins.  Inability to satisfy customer demand in a timely manner may harm our reputation, reduce our other opportunities, damage our relationships with customers, reduce revenue growth, and/or incur contractual penalties.Alternatively, downturns in the industries in which we compete may cause our customers to significantly reduce their demand.  With respect to orders we initiate with our suppliers to address anticipated demand from our customers, certain suppliers may have required non-cancelable purchase commitments or advance payments from us, and those obligations and commitments could reduce our ability to adjust our inventory or expense levels to declining market demands. Unexpected decline in customer demands can result in excess or obsolete inventory and result in additional charges.  Because certain of our sales, research and development and internal manufacturing overhead expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in customer demand likely would decrease our gross margins and operating income.   We May Encounter Increased CompetitionWe may encounter substantial competition from other companies in the same market, including established companies with significant resources. Some of our competitors may have financial, technical, marketing or other capabilities that are more extensive than ours.  They may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and other competitive pressures. We may not be able to compete successfully against our present or future competitors.  Our failure to effectively compete could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.There Are Limitations on the Protection of Our Intellectual Property and We May From Time to Time be Involved in Costly Intellectual Property Litigation or IndemnificationWe rely on a combination of trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws combined with employee confidentiality, noncompetition and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance that the steps taken by us will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or intellectual property. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that third-parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future. Asserting our intellectual property rights or defending against third-party claims could involve substantial expense.  In the event a third-party were successful in a claim that one of our processes infringed its proprietary rights, we could be required to pay substantial damages or royalties, or spend substantial amounts in order to obtain a license or modify processes so that they no longer infringe such proprietary rights.  Any such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. A Significant Portion of Our Business is Dependent on Cyclical Industries Our business is dependent on the demand for products produced by end-users of industrial lasers, optical communication products and components for 3D sensing. Many of these end-users are in industries that have historically experienced a highly cyclical demand for their products. As a result, demand for our products is subject to these cyclical fluctuations. Fluctuations in demand could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 20 Changes in Laws and Regulations Governing Data Privacy and Data Protection Could Have a Material Adverse Impact on our BusinessWe are subject to many data privacy, data protection, and data breach notification laws, including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective in May of 2018. While we have taken measures to assess the requirements of, and to comply with, the GDPR, as well as new and existing data-related laws and regulations of other jurisdictions, these measures may be challenged, including by authorities that regulate data-related compliance. We could incur significant expense in facilitating and responding to investigations, and if the measures we have taken prove to be inadequate, we could face fines, penalties or damages, and incur reputational harm, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.Data Breach Incidents and Breakdown of Information and Communication Technologies Could Disrupt our Operations and Impact Our Financial Results In the course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property (both our own and that of our customers), as well as proprietary business information. We could be subject to service outages or breaches of security systems which may result in disruption, unauthorized access, misappropriation, or corruption of this information. Security breaches of our network or data, including physical or electronic break-ins, vendor service outages, computer viruses, attacks by hackers or similar breaches can create system disruptions, shutdowns, or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Although we have not experienced an incident, if we are unable to prevent such security or privacy breaches, our operations would be disrupted or we could suffer legal claims, loss of reputation, financial loss, property damage, or regulatory penalties because of lost or misappropriated information. Global Economic Downturns May Adversely Affect Our Business, Operating Results and Financial Condition Current and future conditions in the global economy have an inherent degree of uncertainty. As a result, it is difficult to estimate the level of growth or contraction for the global economy as a whole. It is even more difficult to estimate growth or contraction in various parts, sectors and regions of the economy, including industrial, military, optical communications, telecommunications, semiconductor, and medical and life science markets in which we participate. All aspects of our company forecast depend on estimates of growth or contraction in the markets we serve.  Thus, prevailing global economic uncertainties render estimates of future income and expenditures very difficult to make. Global economic downturns may affect industries in which our customers operate. These changes could include decreases in the rate of consumption or use of our customers’ products. Such conditions could have a material adverse effect on demand for our customers’ products, and in turn, on demand for our products. Adverse changes may occur in the future as a result of declining or flat global or regional economic conditions, fluctuations in currency and commodity prices, wavering confidence, capital expenditure reductions, unemployment, decline in stock markets, contraction of credit availability or other factors affecting economic conditions. For example, factors that may affect our operating results include disruption in the credit and financial markets in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, adverse effects of slowdowns in the European and Chines economies, slowdown in the Chinese economy, reductions or limited growth in consumer spending or consumer credit, global trade tariffs and other adverse economic conditions that may be specific to the Internet, e-commerce and payments industries. These changes may negatively affect sales of products and increase exposure to losses from bad debt and commodity prices, the cost and availability of financing, and costs associated with manufacturing and distributing products. Any economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We Are Subject to Complex and Rapidly Changing Governmental Import and Export Regulations We are subject to the passage of and changes in the interpretation of regulation by U.S. government entities at the federal, state and local levels and non-U.S. agencies, including, but not limited to, the following:  •We are required to comply with import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons, including dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies.  We may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item.  Compliance with the import laws that apply to our businesses may restrict our access to, and may increase the cost of obtaining, certain products and could interrupt our supply of imported inventory.  •Exported technologies necessary to develop and manufacture certain products are subject to U.S. export control laws and similar laws of other jurisdictions.  We may be subject to adverse regulatory consequences, including government oversight of facilities and export transactions, monetary penalties and other sanctions for violations of these laws. In certain instances, these regulations may prohibit the Company from developing or manufacturing certain of its products for specific end applications outside the United States. 21 Failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation. Changes in U.S. Trade Policies Could Impact the Company’s International Operations and the Cost of Imported Goods into the U.S., Which May Narrow the Size of Our Markets, Materially Impact Our Revenues or Increase Our Operating Costs and Expose Us to Contract LitigationOn March 23, 2018, President Trump announced new steel and aluminum tariffs, and on April 15, 2018, the U.S. Department of Commerce issued a denial order against two companies in the telecommunications market. Other international trade actions and initiatives also have been announced, notably the imposition by the U.S. of additional tariffs on products of Chinese origin, and China’s imposition of additional tariffs on U.S.-origin goods. If we cannot obtain relief from, or if we cannot take other action to mitigate the impact of, these additional duties, our business and profits may be materially and adversely affected. Further changes in U.S. trade policy, or additional sanctions, could result in retaliatory actions by other countries that could materially and negatively impact the volume of economic activity in the U.S., which, in turn, may decrease our access to customers and markets, reduce our revenues, and increase our operating costs. We Have Entered into Supply Agreements which Commit Us to Supply Products on Specified TermsWe have supply agreements with some customers which require us to supply products and to allocate sufficient capacity to make these products.  We have also agreed to pricing schedules and methodologies which could result in penalties if we fail to meet development, supply, capacity and quality commitments.  Failure to do so may cause us to be unable to generate the amount of revenue or the level of profitability we expect from these arrangements.  Our ability to realize a profit under some of these agreements will be subject to the level of customer demand, the cost of maintaining facilities and manufacturing capacity, and supply chain capability. If we fail to fulfill our commitments under these supply agreements, our business, after using all remedies available, financial conditions and results of operations may suffer a material adverse effect. We Depend on Highly Complex Manufacturing Processes That Require Feeder Materials, Components and Products from Limited Sources of Supply Our operations are dependent upon a supply chain of difficult-to-make or difficult-to-refine products and materials.  Some of our product inflow is subject to yield reductions from growth or fabrication losses, and thus the quantities we may receive are not consistently predictable.  Customers may also change the specification for a product that our suppliers cannot meet. We also make products for which the Company is one of the world’s largest suppliers.  We use high-quality, optical grade ZnSe in the production of many of our IR optical products. We are a leading producer of ZnSe for our internal use and for external sale. The production of ZnSe is a complex process requiring a highly controlled environment. A number of factors, including defective or contaminated materials, could adversely affect our ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields of high quality ZnSe. Lack of adequate availability of high quality ZnSe could have a material adverse effect upon our business. There can be no assurance that we will not experience manufacturing yield inefficiencies which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We produce hydrogen selenide gas which is used in our production of ZnSe. There are risks inherent in the production and handling of such material. Our lack of proper handling of hydrogen selenide could require us to curtail our production of hydrogen selenide. Our potential inability to internally produce hydrogen selenide could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, we produce and use other high purity and relatively uncommon materials and compounds to manufacture our products including, but not limited to, ZnS, GaAs, Yttrium Aluminum Garnet, Yttrium Lithium Fluoride, Calcium Fluoride, Germanium, Selenium, Telluride, Bismuth Telluride and SiC. A significant failure of our internal production processes or our suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of these necessary materials on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Our Global Operations Are Subject to Complex Legal and Regulatory RequirementsWe manufacture products in the United States, China, Singapore, Vietnam, the Philippines, Germany, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom and through a contract manufacturer in Thailand.  We also maintain direct sales offices in Hong Kong, Japan, Germany, China, Switzerland, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Italy, South Korea and Taiwan.  Operations outside of the United States are subject to many legal and regulatory requirements, some of which are not aligned with others.  These include tariffs, quotas, taxes and other market barriers, restrictions on the export or import of technology, potentially limited intellectual property protection, customs 22 import and export requirements, anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, foreign investment rules and regulations, data privacy requirements, anti-competition laws, employment and labor laws, pensions and social insurance,  and environmental health, and safety laws and regulations. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be onerous and expensive, and requirements differ among jurisdictions.  New laws, changes in existing laws and abrogation of local regulations by national laws result in significant uncertainties in how they will be interpreted and enforced. Failure to comply with any of these foreign laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We Use and Generate Potentially Hazardous Substances that Are Subject to Stringent Environmental Regulations Hazardous substances used or generated in some of our research and manufacturing facilities are subject to stringent environmental regulation. We believe that our handling of such substances is in material compliance with applicable local, state and federal environmental, safety and health regulations at each operating location. We invest substantially in proper personal protective equipment, process controls including monitoring and specialized training to minimize risks to employees, surrounding communities and the environment that could result from the presence and handling of such hazardous substances. When exposure problems or potential exposure problems have been uncovered, corrective actions have been implemented and re-occurrence has been minimal or non-existent. We have in place an emergency response plan with respect to our generation and use of the hazardous substances Hydrogen Selenide, Hydrogen Sulfide, Arsine and Phosphine. Special attention has been given to all procedures pertaining to this gaseous material to minimize the chances of its accidental release into the atmosphere. With respect to the manufacturing, use, storage and disposal of the low-level radioactive material Thorium Fluoride, our facilities and procedures have been inspected and licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Thorium-bearing by-products are collected and shipped as solid waste to a government-approved low-level radioactive waste disposal site in Clive, Utah. The generation, use, collection, storage and disposal of all other hazardous by-products, such as suspended solids containing heavy metals or airborne particulates, are believed by us to be in material compliance with regulations. We believe that we have obtained all of the permits and licenses required for operation of our business. We do not carry environmental impairment insurance. Although we do not know of any material environmental, safety or health problems in our properties or processes or products, there can be no assurance that problems will not develop in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We May Be Adversely Affected by Climate Change Regulations In many of the countries in which we operate, government bodies are increasingly enacting legislation and regulations in response to potential impacts of climate change. These laws and regulations may be mandatory. They have the potential to impact our operations directly or indirectly as a result of required compliance by our customers or our supply chain. Inconsistency of regulations may also affect the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations. Assessments of the potential impact of future climate change legislation, regulation and international treaties and accords are uncertain, given the wide scope of potential regulatory change in countries in which we operate. We may incur increased capital expenditures resulting from required compliance with revised or new legislation or regulations, added costs to purchase or lower profits from sales of our products, allowances or credits under a “cap and trade” system, increased insurance premiums and deductibles as new actuarial tables are developed to reshape coverage, a change in competitive position relative to industry peers, and changes to profit or loss arising from increased or decreased demand for goods produced by us and indirectly, from changes in costs of goods sold. Some Systems That Use our Products Are Complex in Design, and Our Products May Contain Defects that Are Not Detected Until Deployed Which Could Increase Our Costs, Reduce Our Revenues, Cause Us to Lose Key Customers and May Expose Us to Litigation Arising From Derivative Lawsuits Related to Consumer ProductsSome systems that use our products are inherently complex in design and require ongoing maintenance. Our customers may discover defects in our products after the products have been fully deployed and operated under peak stress conditions. In addition, some of our products are combined with products from other vendors which may contain defects. Should problems occur, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. If we are unable to correct defects or other problems, we could experience, among other things loss of customers, increased costs of product returns and warranty expenses, damage to our brand reputation, failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance, diversion of development and engineering resources, or legal action by our customers. 23 The occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Unfavorable Changes in Tax Rates, Tax Liabilities or Tax Accounting Rules Could Negatively Affect Future Results As a global company, we are subject to taxation in the United States and various other countries and jurisdictions. As such, we must exercise a level of judgment in determining our worldwide tax liabilities. Our future tax rates could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in countries with differing tax rates or changes in tax laws. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significantly adverse impact on our effective tax rate. For example, proposals for fundamental U.S. international tax reform, if enacted, could have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate. The enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”) in December 2017 significantly affected U.S. tax law by changing how the U.S. imposes tax on multinational corporations. The U.S. Department of Treasury has broad authority under the Act to issue regulations and interpretive guidance. We have applied available guidance to estimate our tax obligations, but new guidance issued by the U.S. Treasury Department may cause us to make adjustments to our tax estimates in future periods. The Securities and Exchange Commission has issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (“SAB 118”) acknowledging that companies will potentially encounter situations for which the analysis of certain income tax effects of the Act will be incomplete by the time financial statements are required to be issued for reporting periods that include the enactment date. In these situations, SAB 118 provides that reasonable estimates may be made for certain effects of the Act. We have recorded provisional amounts using reasonable estimates based on the guidance in SAB 118 and we anticipate adjustments to such estimates as additional analysis is completed and new regulations and guidance are issued.In addition, we are subject to regular examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provision and accruals, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operation or financial condition. Increases in Commodity Prices May Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of increases in commodity prices. Our businesses purchase, produce and sell high-purity selenium and other raw materials based upon quoted market prices from minor metal exchanges. The negative impact from increases in commodity prices may not be recovered through our product sales which could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings and financial condition. Natural Disasters or Other Global or Regional Catastrophic Events Could Disrupt Our Operations, Give Rise to Substantial Environmental Hazards and Adversely Affect Our Results We may be exposed to business interruptions due to catastrophe, natural disaster, pandemic, terrorism or acts of war that are beyond our control. Disruptions to our facilities or systems, or to those of our key suppliers, could also interrupt operational processes and adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products and provide services and support to our customers. As a result, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Our Success Depends on Our Ability to Attract, Retain and Develop Key Personnel and Requires Continued Good Relations With Our EmployeesWe are highly dependent upon the experience and continuing services of certain scientists, engineers, production and management personnel. Competition for the services of these personnel is intense.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain or attract the personnel necessary for our success. The loss of the services of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Our Stock Price Has Been Volatile in the Past and May Be Volatile in the FutureThe market price for our common stock on The Nasdaq Global Select Market varied between a high of $53.08 and a low of $34.00 in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. We expect that this volatility will continue. Factors that could cause fluctuation in our stock price include, among other things, general economic and market conditions, actual or anticipated variations in operating results, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts, our inability to meet or exceed securities analysts’ estimates or expectations, conditions or trends in the industries in which our products are purchased, announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, divestitures, joint ventures or other strategic initiatives, capital commitments, additions or departures of key personnel,  sales of our common stock or equity-linked securities and issuance of shares of our common stock in connection with conversions of our outstanding convertible senior notes.24 Many of these factors are beyond our control. However, these factors could cause the market price of our common stock to decline, regardless of our actual operating performance. In addition, in recent years, the stock market in general, and The Nasdaq Stock Market and the securities of technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies. These broad market fluctuations have in the past, and may in the future, materially and adversely affect our stock price, regardless of our operating results. This volatility may affect the price at which our shareholders can sell our common stock.Some Anti-takeover Provisions Contained in Our Articles of Incorporation and By-laws, as Well as Provisions of Pennsylvania Law, Could Impair a Takeover Attempt, Which Could Also Reduce the Market Price of Our Common Stock Our articles of incorporation and by-laws contain provisions that could make us a less attractive target for a hostile takeover and could make more difficult or discourage a merger proposal, a tender offer or a proxy contest. Such provisions include:  •A requirement that shareholder-nominated director nominees be nominated in advance of the meeting at which directors are elected and that specific information be provided in connection with such nomination;  •The ability of our board of directors to issue additional shares of common stock or preferred stock without shareholder approval; and  •Certain provisions requiring supermajority approval (at least two-thirds of the votes cast by all shareholders entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class). In addition, the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law (the “BCL”) contains provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us or changes in our management. Many of these provisions are triggered if any person or group acquires, or discloses intent to acquire, 20% or more of a corporation’s voting power, subject to certain exceptions. These provisions: •provide the other shareholders of the corporation with certain rights against the acquiring group or person; •prohibit the corporation from engaging in a broad range of business combinations with the acquiring group or person;  •restrict the voting and other rights of the acquiring group or person; and •provide that certain profits realized by the acquiring group or person from the sale of our equity securities belong to and are recoverable by us.Regardless of the amount of a person’s holdings, if a shareholder or shareholder group (including affiliated persons) would be a party to certain proposed transactions with us or would be treated differently from other shareholders of ours in certain proposed transactions, the BCL requires approval by a majority of votes entitled to be cast by all shareholders other than the interested shareholder or affiliate group, unless the transaction is approved by independent directors or other criteria are satisfied. Furthermore, under the BCL, a “short-form” merger of II-VI cannot be implemented without the consent of our board of directors.In addition, as permitted by Pennsylvania law, an amendment to our articles of incorporation or other corporate action that is approved by shareholders may provide mandatory special treatment for specified groups of non-consenting shareholders of the same class. For example, an amendment to our articles of incorporation or other corporate action may provide that shares of common stock held by designated shareholders of record must be cashed out at a price determined by the corporation, subject to applicable dissenters’ rights.Furthermore, the BCL provides that directors may, in discharging their duties, consider, to the extent they deem appropriate, the effects of any action upon shareholders, employees, suppliers, customers and the communities in which its offices are located. Directors are not required to consider the interests of shareholders to a greater degree than other constituencies’ interests. The BCL expressly provides that directors do not violate their fiduciary duties solely by relying on “poison pills” or the anti-takeover provisions of the BCL. We do not currently have a “poison pill.”  All of these provisions may limit the price that investors may be willing to pay for shares of our common stock.Because We Do Not Currently Intend to Pay Dividends, Holders of Our Common Stock Will Benefit from an Investment in Our Common Stock Only If It Appreciates in Value, and by the Intended Anti-Dilution Actions of Our Share-Buyback ProgramWe have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock, and do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.  We currently anticipate that we will retain any future earnings to support operations and to finance the development of our business. As a result, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon future appreciation in its value. There is no guarantee that our common stock will maintain its value or appreciate in value.  25 "
7,COHR,COHERENT INC,2017-08-21,">Item 1A.RISK FACTORS We caution our investors that our performance is subject to risks and uncertainties. The following material risk factors may cause our future results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. You should carefully consider these factors, as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K when evaluating an investment in our securities. Investments in Future Markets of Potential Significant Growth May Not Result in Expected Returns We previously announced an investment program with the goal of gaining a greater share of end markets using semiconductor lasers, especially those used for 3D sensing.  We cannot guarantee that our investments in capital and capabilities will be sufficient.  The potential market, as well as our ability to gain market share in such market, may not materialize on the timeline anticipated or at all.  We cannot be sure of the end market price for products incorporating our technologies. Our technologies could fail to fulfill, completely or at all, our target customers’ finalized specifications.  We cannot guarantee the end market customers’ acceptance of our technologies. Further, we may be unable to fulfill the terms of our contracts with our target customers, which could result in penalties of a material nature, including consequential damages, loss of market share and loss of reputation.Our Competitive Position Depends on Our Ability to Develop New Products and Processes To meet our strategic objectives, we must develop, manufacture and market new products and continue to update our existing products and processes to keep pace with market developments to address increasingly sophisticated customer requirements. Our success in developing and selling new and enhanced products and processes depends upon a variety of factors including strategic product selection, efficient completion of product design and development, timely implementation of manufacturing and assembly processes, effective sales and marketing, and successful product performance in the market. The introduction by our competitors of products or processes using new developments better or faster than ours could render our products or processes obsolete or unmarketable.  We intend to continue to make significant investments in research and development to achieve our goals.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new products or enhancements to our existing products and processes in a manner which satisfies customer needs or achieves market acceptance. The failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business and maintain our competitive position and on our results of operations and/or financial condition.  Our Competitive Position May Require Significant Investments in Strategic Acquisitions, With Associated Integration Risks, Which May Not Be SuccessfulWe continuously monitor the marketplace for strategic opportunities, and our business strategy includes expanding our product lines and markets through both internal product development and acquisitions.  Consequently, we expect to continue to consider strategic acquisition of businesses, products or technologies complementary to our business.  This may require significant investments of management time and financial resources.  If market demand is outside our organic capabilities, if a strategic acquisition is required and we cannot identify one or execute on it, and/or if financial investments that we undertake distract management, do not result in the expected return on investment, expose us to unforeseen liabilities or jeopardize our ability to comply with our credit facility covenants due to any inability to integrate the business, retain staff, or work with the customers or otherwise we could suffer a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.19 Our Future Success Depends on Continued International Sales Sales to customers in countries other than the United States accounted for approximately 69%, 63% and 63% of revenues during the years ended June 30, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. If we do not maintain our current volume of international sales, we could suffer a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. Foreign Currency Risk May Negatively Affect our Revenues, Cost of Sales and Operating Margins and Could Result in Foreign Exchange Losses  We conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most countries in which we operate. Our net sales outside the United States represented a majority of our total sales in each of the last three fiscal years. We incur currency transaction risk whenever one of our operating subsidiaries enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a different currency from the currency in which it operates or holds assets or liabilities in a currency different than its functional currency. Changes in exchange rates can also affect our results of operations when the value of sales and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars. We cannot accurately predict the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations. Further, given the volatility of exchange rates, we may not be able to effectively manage our currency risks, and any volatility in currency exchange rates may increase the price of our products in local currency to our foreign customers or increase the manufacturing cost of our products, either of which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows and profitability.Any Inability to Access Financial Markets from Time to Time to Raise Capital, Finance Working Capital Requirements or Our Acquisition Strategies, or Otherwise to Support our Liquidity Needs Could Negatively Impact our Ability to Finance our Operations, Meet Certain Obligations or Implement our Growth Strategy.  We occasionally borrow under our existing credit facilities to fund operations, including working capital investments, and to finance our acquisition strategies. In the past, market disruptions experienced in the United States and abroad have materially impacted liquidity in the credit and debt markets, making financing terms for borrowers less attractive, and, in certain cases, have resulted in the unavailability of certain types of financing. Uncertainty in the financial markets may negatively impact our ability to access additional financing or to refinance our existing credit facilities or existing debt arrangements on favorable terms or at all, which could negatively affect our ability to fund current and future expansion as well as future acquisitions and development. These disruptions may include turmoil in the financial services industry, volatility in the markets where our outstanding securities trade, and general economic downturns in the areas where we do business. If we are unable to access funds at competitive rates, or if our short-term or long-term borrowing costs increase, our ability to finance our operations, meet our short-term obligations and implement our operating strategies could be adversely affected.   In the future we may be required to raise additional capital through public or private financing or other arrangements. Such financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and our failure to raise capital when needed could harm our business and prospects. Additional equity financing may be dilutive to the holders of our common stock, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to undertake certain operational activities that we otherwise would find to be desirable. Further, debt service obligations associated with any such debt financing could reduce our profitability. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to grow our business or respond to competitive pressures.We May Fail to Accurately Estimate Our Customers’ DemandsWe make significant decisions based on our estimates of customer requirements.  We use our estimates to determine the levels of business we seek and accept, production schedules, personnel needs and other resource requirements.Customers may require rapid increases in production on short notice.  We may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or allocate sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet such increases in demand. Rapid customer ramp-up and significant increases in demand may strain our resources or negatively affect our margins.  Inability to satisfy customer demand in a timely manner may harm our reputation, reduce our other opportunities, damage our relationships with customers, reduce revenue growth, and/or incur contractual penalties.Alternatively, downturns in the industries in which we compete may cause our customers to significantly reduce their demand.  With respect to orders we initiate with our suppliers to address anticipated demand from our customers, certain suppliers may have required non-cancelable purchase commitments or advance payments from us, and those obligations and commitments could reduce our ability to adjust our inventory or expense levels to declining market demands. Unexpected decline in customer demands can result in excess or obsolete inventory and result in additional charges.  Because certain of our sales, research and development and internal manufacturing overhead expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in customer demand likely would decrease our gross margins and operating income.   20 We May Encounter Substantial CompetitionWe may encounter substantial competition from other companies in the same market, including established companies with significant resources. Some of our competitors may have financial, technical, marketing or other capabilities that are more extensive than ours.  They may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and other competitive pressures. We may not be able to compete successfully against our present or future competitors.  Our failure to effectively compete could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.There Are Limitations on the Protection of Our Intellectual Property We rely on a combination of trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws combined with employee confidentiality, noncompetition and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance that the steps taken by us will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or intellectual property. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that third-parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future. Asserting our intellectual property rights or defending against third-party claims could involve substantial expense.  In the event a third-party were successful in a claim that one of our processes infringed its proprietary rights, we could be required to pay substantial damages or royalties, or spend substantial amounts in order to obtain a license or modify processes so that they no longer infringe such proprietary rights.  Any such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. A Significant Portion of Our Business is Dependent on Cyclical Industries Our business is significantly dependent on the demand for products produced by end-users of industrial lasers and optical communication products. Many of these end-users are in industries that have historically experienced a highly cyclical demand for their products. As a result, demand for our products is subject to these cyclical fluctuations. Fluctuations in demand could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Data Breach Incidents and Breakdown of Information and Communication Technologies Could Disrupt our Operations and Impact Our Financial Results In the course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property (both our own and that of our customers), as well as proprietary business information. We could be subject to service outages or breaches of security systems which may result in disruption, unauthorized access, misappropriation, or corruption of this information. Security breaches of our network or data, including physical or electronic break-ins, vendor service outages, computer viruses, attacks by hackers or similar breaches can create system disruptions, shutdowns, or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Although we have not experienced an incident, if we are unable to prevent such security or privacy breaches, our operations would be disrupted or we could suffer legal claims, loss of reputation, financial loss, property damage, or regulatory penalties because of lost or misappropriated information. Global Economic Downturns May Adversely Affect Our Business, Operating Results and Financial Condition Current and future conditions in the global economy have an inherent degree of uncertainty. As a result, it is difficult to estimate the level of growth or contraction for the global economy as a whole. It is even more difficult to estimate growth or contraction in various parts, sectors and regions of the economy, including industrial, military, optical communications, telecommunications, semiconductor, and medical and life science markets in which we participate. All aspects of our company forecast depend on estimates of growth or contraction in the markets we serve.  Thus, prevailing global economic uncertainties render estimates of future income and expenditures very difficult to make. Global economic downturns may affect industries in which our customers operate. These changes could include decreases in the rate of consumption or use of our customers’ products. Such conditions could have a material adverse effect on demand for our customers’ products, and in turn, on demand for our products. Adverse changes may occur in the future as a result of declining or flat global or regional economic conditions, fluctuations in currency and commodity prices, wavering confidence, capital expenditure reductions, unemployment, decline in stock markets, contraction of credit availability or other factors affecting economic conditions. For example, factors that may affect our operating results include disruption in the credit and financial markets in the United States, Europe and elsewhere, adverse effects of ongoing stagnation in the European economy, slowdown in the Chinese economy, reductions or limited growth in consumer spending or consumer credit, and other adverse economic conditions that may be specific to the Internet, e-commerce and payments industries. 21 These changes may negatively affect sales of products and increase exposure to losses from bad debt and commodity prices, the cost and availability of financing, and costs associated with manufacturing and distributing products. Any economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We Are Subject to Governmental Import and Export Regulations We are subject to the passage of and changes in the interpretation of regulation by U.S. government entities at the federal, state and local levels and non-U.S. agencies, including, but not limited to, the following:  •We are required to comply with import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons, including dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies.  We may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item.  Compliance with the import laws that apply to our businesses may restrict our access to, and may increase the cost of obtaining, certain products and could interrupt our supply of imported inventory.  •Exported technologies necessary to develop and manufacture certain products are subject to U.S. export control laws and similar laws of other jurisdictions.  We may be subject to adverse regulatory consequences, including government oversight of facilities and export transactions, monetary penalties and other sanctions for violations of these laws. In certain instances, these regulations may prohibit the Company from developing or manufacturing certain of its products for specific end applications outside the United States. Failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation. Our Global Operations are Complex to ManageWe manufacture products in the United States, China, Singapore, Vietnam, the Philippines, Germany, and Switzerland, and through contract manufacturers in Thailand and China.  We also maintain direct sales offices in Hong Kong, Japan, Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Belgium, China, Singapore, Italy, South Korea, and Taiwan.  Our operations vary by location and are influenced on a location-by-location basis by local customs, languages and work practices, as well as different local weather conditions, management styles and education systems. In addition, multiple complex issues may arise concurrently in different countries, potentially hampering our management’s ability to respond in an effective and timely manner. Any inability to respond in an effective and timely manner to issues in our global operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We Have Entered into Supply Agreements which Commit Us to Supply Products on Specified TermsWe have supply agreements with some customers which require us to supply products and to allocate sufficient capacity to make these products.  We have also agreed to pricing schedules and methodologies which could result in penalties if we fail to meet development, supply and quality commitments.  Failure to do so may cause us to be unable to generate the amount of revenue or the level of profitability we expect from these arrangements.  Our ability to realize a profit under some of these agreements will be subject to the level of customer demand, the cost of maintaining facilities and manufacturing capacity, and supply chain capability. If we fail to fulfill our commitments under these supply agreements our business, after using all remedies available, financial conditions and results of operations may suffer a material adverse effect. We Depend on Highly Complex Manufacturing Processes That Require Products from Limited Sources of Supply Our operations are dependent upon a supply chain of difficult-to-make or difficult-to-refine products and materials.  Some of our product inflow is subject to yield reductions from growth or fabrication losses, and thus the quantities we may receive are not consistently predictable.  Customers may also change the specification for a product that our suppliers cannot meet. We also make products for which the Company is one of the world’s largest suppliers.  We use high-quality, optical grade ZnSe in the production of many of our IR optical products. We are a leading producer of ZnSe for our internal use and for external sale. The production of ZnSe is a complex process requiring a highly controlled environment. A number of factors, including defective or contaminated materials, could adversely affect our ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields of high quality ZnSe. Lack of adequate availability of high quality ZnSe could have a material adverse effect upon our business. There can be no assurance that we will not experience manufacturing yield inefficiencies which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 22 We produce hydrogen selenide gas which is used in our production of ZnSe. There are risks inherent in the production and handling of such material. Our lack of proper handling of hydrogen selenide could require us to curtail our production of hydrogen selenide. Our potential inability to internally produce hydrogen selenide could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, we produce and use other high purity and relatively uncommon materials and compounds to manufacture our products including, but not limited to, ZnS, GaAs, Yttrium Aluminum Garnet, Yttrium Lithium Fluoride, Calcium Fluoride, Germanium, Selenium, Telluride, Bismuth Telluride and SiC. A significant failure of our internal production processes or our suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of these necessary materials on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Our Global Operations Are Subject to Complex Legal and Regulatory RequirementsWe manufacture products in the United States, China, Singapore, Vietnam, the Philippines, Germany, and Switzerland, and through contract manufacturers in Thailand and China.  We also maintain direct sales offices in Hong Kong, Japan, Germany, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Belgium, China, Singapore, Italy, South Korea and Taiwan.  Operations outside of the United States are subject to many legal and regulatory requirements, some of which are not aligned with others.  These include tariffs, quotas, taxes and other market barriers, restrictions on the export or import of technology, potentially limited intellectual property protection, customs import and export requirements, anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, foreign investment rules and regulations, data privacy requirements, anti-competition laws, employment and labor laws, pensions and social insurance,  and environmental health, and safety laws and regulations. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be onerous and expensive, and requirements differ among jurisdictions.  New laws, changes in existing laws and abrogation of local regulations by national laws result in significant uncertainties in how they will be interpreted and enforced. Failure to comply with any of these foreign laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We Use and Generate Hazardous Substances that Are Subject to Stringent Environmental Regulations Hazardous substances used or generated in our research and manufacturing facilities are subject to stringent environmental regulation. We believe that our handling of such substances is in material compliance with applicable local, state and federal environmental, safety and health regulations at each operating location. We invest substantially in proper protective equipment, process controls and specialized training to minimize risks to employees, surrounding communities and the environment that could result from the presence and handling of such hazardous substances. We regularly conduct employee physical examinations and workplace monitoring regarding such substances. When exposure problems or potential exposure problems have been uncovered, corrective actions have been implemented and re-occurrence has been minimal or non-existent. We have in place an emergency response plan with respect to our generation and use of the hazardous substance Hydrogen Selenide. Special attention has been given to all procedures pertaining to this gaseous material to minimize the chances of its accidental release into the atmosphere. With respect to the manufacturing, use, storage and disposal of the low-level radioactive material Thorium Fluoride, our facilities and procedures have been inspected and licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Thorium-bearing by-products are collected and shipped as solid waste to a government-approved low-level radioactive waste disposal site in Clive, Utah. The generation, use, collection, storage and disposal of all other hazardous by-products, such as suspended solids containing heavy metals or airborne particulates, are believed by us to be in material compliance with regulations. We believe that we have obtained all of the permits and licenses required for operation of our business. We do not carry environmental impairment insurance. Although we do not know of any material environmental, safety or health problems in our properties or processes, there can be no assurance that problems will not develop in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 23 We May Be Adversely Affected by Climate Change Regulations In many of the countries in which we operate, government bodies are increasingly enacting legislation and regulations in response to potential impacts of climate change. These laws and regulations may be mandatory. They have the potential to impact our operations directly or indirectly as a result of required compliance by our customers or our supply chain. Inconsistency of regulations may also affect the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations. Assessments of the potential impact of future climate change legislation, regulation and international treaties and accords are uncertain, given the wide scope of potential regulatory change in countries in which we operate. We may incur increased capital expenditures resulting from required compliance with revised or new legislation or regulations, added costs to purchase or lower profits from sales of our products, allowances or credits under a “cap and trade” system, increased insurance premiums and deductibles as new actuarial tables are developed to reshape coverage, a change in competitive position relative to industry peers, and changes to profit or loss arising from increased or decreased demand for goods produced by us and indirectly, from changes in costs of goods sold. Some Systems That Use our Products Are Complex in Design and May Contain Defects that Are Not Detected Until Deployed Which Could Increase Our Costs and Reduce Our Revenues Some systems that use our products are inherently complex in design and require ongoing maintenance. Our customers may discover defects in our products after the products have been fully deployed and operated under peak stress conditions. In addition, some of our products are combined with products from other vendors which may contain defects. Should problems occur, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. If we are unable to correct defects or other problems, we could experience, among other things loss of customers, increased costs of product returns and warranty expenses, damage to our brand reputation, failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance, diversion of development and engineering resources, or legal action by our customers. The occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Significant Defense Spending Cuts and/or Reductions in Defense Programs Could Adversely Impact Our Business Specific to the military business within our II-VI Laser Solutions and II-VI Performance Products segments, sales to customers in the defense industry totaled approximately 11% of our revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017. These customers generally contract with a governmental entity, typically a U.S. governmental agency. Future reductions in defense spending could result from the current or future economic or political environment.  For example, the ongoing sequestration of the defense budget could result in reductions in demand for defense-related products that we produce. Further, changes to existing defense procurement laws and regulations could adversely affect our results of operations.  Most governmental programs are subject to funding approval and can be modified or terminated with no warning upon the determination of a legislative or administrative body. The loss of or failure to obtain certain contracts or the loss of a major government customer could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Changes in Tax Rates, Tax Liabilities or Tax Accounting Rules Could Affect Future Results As a global company, we are subject to taxation in the United States and various other countries and jurisdictions. As such, we must exercise a level of judgment in determining our worldwide tax liabilities. Our future tax rates could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in countries with differing tax rates or changes in tax laws. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significantly adverse impact on our effective tax rate. For example, proposals for fundamental U.S. international tax reform, if enacted, could have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate. In addition, we are subject to regular examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provision and accruals, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operation or financial condition. Increases in Commodity Prices May Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of increases in commodity prices. Our businesses purchase, produce and sell high-purity selenium and other raw materials based upon quoted market prices from minor metal exchanges. The negative impact from increases in commodity prices may not be recovered through our product sales which could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings and financial condition. 24 Natural Disasters or Other Global or Regional Catastrophic Events Could Disrupt Our Operations and Adversely Affect Our Results We may be exposed to business interruptions due to catastrophe, natural disaster, pandemic, terrorism or acts of war that are beyond our control. Disruptions to our facilities or systems, or to those of our key suppliers, could also interrupt operational processes and adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products and provide services and support to our customers. As a result, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. Our Success Depends on Our Ability to Retain Key Personnel We are highly dependent upon the experience and continuing services of certain scientists, engineers, production and management personnel. Competition for the services of these personnel is intense.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain or attract the personnel necessary for our success. The loss of the services of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We Have Agreements with Government Entities That Are Subject to Significant Compliance Requirements and Changes in Government SpendingOur agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination, reduction or modification in the event of changes in government requirements, reductions in federal spending and other factors. We are also subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements of government contracts, including procurement integrity, export control, employment practices, the accuracy of records and the recording of costs.  Failure to comply with these requirements might result in suspension of these contracts and suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting.Our Stock Price Has Been Highly Volatile in the Past and May Be Extremely Volatile in the FutureThe market price for our common stock on The NASDAQ Global Select Market varied between a high of $41.10 and a low of $17.76 in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017. We expect that this volatility will continue. Factors that could cause fluctuation in our stock price include, among other things, general economic and market conditions, actual or anticipated variations in operating results, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts, our inability to meet or exceed securities analysts’ estimates or expectations, conditions or trends in the industries in which our products are purchased, announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, divestitures, joint ventures or other strategic initiatives, capital commitments, additions or departures of key personnel and sales of our common stock or equity-linked securities.Many of these factors are beyond our control. However, these factors could cause the market price of our common stock to decline, regardless of our actual operating performance. In addition, in recent years, the stock market in general, and The NASDAQ Stock Market and the securities of technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies. These broad market fluctuations have in the past, and may in the future, materially and adversely affect our stock price, regardless of our operating results. This volatility may affect the price at which our shareholders can sell our common stock.Some Anti-takeover Provisions Contained in Our Articles of Incorporation and By-laws, as Well as Provisions of Pennsylvania Law, Could Impair a Takeover Attempt, Which Could Also Reduce the Market Price of Our Common Stock Our articles of incorporation and by-laws contain provisions that could make us a less attractive target for a hostile takeover and could make more difficult or discourage a merger proposal, a tender offer or a proxy contest. Such provisions include:  •A requirement that shareholder-nominated director nominees be nominated in advance of the meeting at which directors are elected and that specific information be provided in connection with such nomination;  •The ability of our board of directors to issue additional shares of common stock or preferred stock without shareholder approval; and  •Certain provisions requiring supermajority approval (at least two-thirds of the votes cast by all shareholders entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class). 25 In addition, the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law (the “BCL”) contains provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us or changes in our management. Many of these provisions are triggered if any person or group acquires, or discloses intent to acquire, 20% or more of a corporation’s voting power, subject to certain exceptions. These provisions: •provide the other shareholders of the corporation with certain rights against the acquiring group or person; •prohibit the corporation from engaging in a broad range of business combinations with the acquiring group or person;  •restrict the voting and other rights of the acquiring group or person; and •provide that certain profits realized by the acquiring group or person from the sale of our equity securities belong to and are recoverable by us.Regardless of the amount of a person’s holdings, if a shareholder or shareholder group (including affiliated persons) would be a party to certain proposed transactions with us or would be treated differently from other shareholders of ours in certain proposed transactions, the BCL requires approval by a majority of votes entitled to be cast by all shareholders other than the interested shareholder or affiliate group, unless the transaction is approved by independent directors or other criteria are satisfied. Furthermore, under the BCL, a “short-form” merger of II-VI cannot be implemented without the consent of our board of directors.In addition, as permitted by Pennsylvania law, an amendment to our articles of incorporation or other corporate action that is approved by shareholders may provide mandatory special treatment for specified groups of nonconsenting shareholders of the same class. For example, an amendment to our articles of incorporation or other corporate action may provide that shares of common stock held by designated shareholders of record must be cashed out at a price determined by the corporation, subject to applicable dissenters’ rights.Furthermore, the BCL provides that directors may, in discharging their duties, consider, to the extent they deem appropriate, the effects of any action upon shareholders, employees, suppliers, customers and the communities in which its offices are located. Directors are not required to consider the interests of shareholders to a greater degree than other constituencies’ interests. The BCL expressly provides that directors do not violate their fiduciary duties solely by relying on “poison pills” or the anti-takeover provisions of the BCL. We do not currently have a “poison pill.”  All of these provisions may limit the price that investors may be willing to pay for shares of our common stock.Because We Do Not Currently Intend to Pay Dividends, Holders of Our Common Stock Will Benefit from an Investment in Our Common Stock Only If It Appreciates in Value We have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock, and do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.  We currently anticipate that we will retain any future earnings to support operations and to finance the development of our business. As a result, the success of an investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon future appreciation in its value. There is no guarantee that our common stock will maintain its value or appreciate in value.  "
4,COHR,COHERENT INC,2016-08-26,">Item 1A.RISK FACTORS  We caution our investors that our performance is subject to risks and uncertainties. The following material risk factors may cause our future results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. You should carefully consider these factors, as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K when evaluating an investment in our securities. Our Future Success Depends on Continued International Sales Sales to customers in countries other than the U.S. accounted for approximately 63%, 63% and 65% of revenues during the years ended June 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. If we do not realize such international sales or if our international sales decrease substantially, we could suffer a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and/or financial condition. Our Competitive Position Depends on Our Ability to Develop New Products and Processes To meet our strategic objectives, we must develop, manufacture and market new products and continue to update our existing products and processes to keep pace with market developments to address increasingly sophisticated customer requirements. Our success in developing and selling new and enhanced products and processes depends upon a variety of factors including strategic product selection, efficient completion of product design and development, timely implementation of manufacturing and assembly processes, effective sales and marketing, and successful product performance in the market. The introduction by our competitors of products or processes using new developments better or faster than ours could render our efforts underway obsolete or unmarketable.  We intend to continue to make significant investments in research and development to achieve our goals.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new products or enhancements to our existing products and processes in a manner which satisfies customer needs or achieves market acceptance. The failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business and maintain our competitive position.  Investments in Future Markets of Potential Significant Growth May Not Result in Expected Returns We previously announced an investment program with the goal of gaining a greater share of end markets using semiconductor lasers, especially those used for 3D sensing.  We cannot guarantee that our investments in capital and capabilities will be sufficient.  The potential market may not materialize on the timeline anticipated or at all.  We cannot be sure of the end market price.  Our technology could fail to fulfill, completely or at all, our target customers’ finalized specifications.  We cannot guarantee the end market customers’ acceptance of our technology. Further, we may be unable to fulfill the terms of our contracts with our target customers, which could result in penalties of a material nature, including consequential damages, loss of market share and loss of reputation.We May Fail to Accurately Estimate Our Customers’ DemandWe make significant decisions based on our estimates of customer requirements.  We use our estimates to determine the levels of business we seek and accept, production schedules, personnel needs and other resource requirements.Customers may require rapid increases in production on short notice.  We may not be able to purchase sufficient supplies or allocate sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet such increases in demand. Rapid customer ramp up and significant increases in demand may strain our resources or negatively affect our margins.  Inability to satisfy customer demand in a timely manner may harm our reputation, reduce our other opportunities, damage our relationships with customers, reduce revenue growth, and/or incur contractual penalties.Alternatively, downturns in the industries in which we compete may cause our customers to significantly reduce their demand.  With respect to orders we initiate with our suppliers prior to a downturn to address our customer’s demand, certain suppliers may have required non-cancelable purchase commitments or advance payments, from us, and those obligations and commitments could reduce our ability to adjust our inventory or expense levels to declining market demands. Unexpected decline in customer demands can result in excess or obsolete inventory and result in additional charges.  Because certain of our sales, research and development and internal manufacturing overhead expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in customer demand may decrease our gross margins and operating income.   Global Economic Downturns May Adversely Affect Our Business, Operating Results and Financial Condition Current and future conditions in the global economy have an inherent degree of uncertainty. As a result, it is difficult to estimate the level of growth or contraction for the global economy as a whole. It is even more difficult to estimate growth or contraction in various parts, sectors and regions of the economy, including industrial, military, optical communications, telecommunications, semiconductor, and medical and life science markets in which we participate. All aspects of our company forecast depend on estimates of growth or 18 contraction in the markets we serve.  Thus, prevailing global economic uncertainties render estimates of future income and expenditures very difficult to make. Global economic downturns may affect industries in which our customers operate. These changes could include decreases in the rate of consumption or use of our customers’ products. Such conditions could have a material adverse effect on demand for our customers’ products, and in turn, on demand for our products. Adverse changes may occur in the future as a result of declining or flat global or regional economic conditions, fluctuations in currency and commodity prices, wavering confidence, capital expenditure reductions, unemployment, decline in stock markets, contraction of credit availability or other factors affecting economic conditions. For example, factors that may affect our operating results include disruption in the credit and financial markets in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere, adverse effects of ongoing stagnation in the European economy, slowdown in the Chinese economy, reductions or limited growth in consumer spending or consumer credit, and other adverse economic conditions that may be specific to the Internet, e-commerce and payments industries. These changes may negatively affect sales of products and increase exposure to losses from bad debt and commodity prices, the cost and availability of financing, and costs associated with manufacturing and distributing products. Any economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Our Global Operations are Complex to ManageWe manufacture products in the United States, China, Singapore, Vietnam, the Philippines, Germany, and Switzerland, and through contract manufacturers in Thailand and China.  We also maintain direct sales offices in Hong Kong, Japan, Germany, Switzerland, the U.K., Belgium, China, Singapore, Italy and South Korea.  Our operations vary by location, are influenced by local customs, languages and work practices as well as different weather conditions, management styles, differences in education from country to country and the  inability of management to always act in a timely manner. In addition, different issues may arise in different countries at the same time, further hampering the management’s ability to respond. Inability to respond to issues in our global operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We Have Entered into Supply Agreements which Commit Us to Supply Products on Specified TermsWe have supply agreements with some customers which require us to supply products and to allocate sufficient capacity to make these products.  We have also agreed to pricing schedules and methodologies which could result in penalties if we fail to meet development, supply and quality commitments.  Failure to do so may cause us to be unable to generate the amount of revenue or the level of profitability we expect from these arrangements.  Our ability to realize a profit under some of these agreements will be subject to the level of customer demand, the cost of maintaining facilities and manufacturing capacity, and supply chain capability. If we fail to fulfill our commitments under these supply agreements our business, after using all remedies available, financial conditions and results of operations may suffer a material adverse effect. We Depend on Highly Complex Manufacturing Processes That Require Products from Limited Sources of Supply Our operations are dependent upon a supply chain of difficult-to-make or difficult-to-refine products and materials.  Some of our product inflow is subject to yield from growth or fabrication operations, and thus the quantities we may receive are not consistently predictable.  Customers may also change the specification for a product that our suppliers cannot meet. We also make products for which the Company is one of the world’s largest suppliers.  We use high-quality, optical grade zinc selenide (ZnSe) in the production of many of our IR optical products. We are the leading producer of ZnSe for our internal use and for external sale. The production of ZnSe is a complex process requiring a highly controlled environment. A number of factors, including defective or contaminated materials, could adversely affect our ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields of high quality ZnSe. No proven external sources of ZnSe are currently available. Lack of adequate availability of high quality ZnSe could have a material adverse effect upon our business. There can be no assurance that we will not experience manufacturing yield inefficiencies which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We produce Hydrogen Selenide gas which is used in our production of ZnSe. There are risks inherent in the production and handling of such material. Our lack of proper handling of Hydrogen Selenide could require us to curtail our production of Hydrogen Selenide. Hydrogen Selenide is available from only one outside source whose quantities and quality may be limited. The cost of purchasing such material is greater than the cost of internal production. As a result, the purchase of a substantial portion of such material from the outside source would increase our ZnSe production costs. Our potential inability to internally produce Hydrogen Selenide could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, we produce and use other high purity and relatively uncommon materials and compounds to manufacture our products including, but not limited to, Zinc Sulfide (ZnS), Gallium Arsenide (GaAs), Yttrium Aluminum Garnet (YAG), Yttrium Lithium Fluoride (YLF), Calcium Fluoride (CaF2), Germanium (Ge), Selenium (Se), Telluride (Te), Bismuth Telluride (Bi2Te3) and Silicon 19 Carbide (SiC). A significant failure of our internal production processes or our suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of these necessary materials on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Our Global Operations Are Subject to Complex Legal and Regulatory RequirementsWe manufacture products in the United States, China, Singapore, Vietnam, the Philippines, Germany, and Switzerland, and through contract manufacturers in Thailand and China.  We also maintain direct sales offices in Hong Kong, Japan, Germany, Switzerland, the U.K., Belgium, China, Singapore, Italy and South Korea.  Operations outside of the U.S. are subject to many legal and regulatory requirements, some of which are not aligned with others.  These include tariffs, quotas, taxes and other market barriers, restrictions on the export or import of technology, potentially limited intellectual property protection, customs import and export requirements, anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, foreign investment rules and regulations, data privacy requirements, anti-competition laws, employment and labor laws, pensions and social insurance,  and environmental health, and safety laws and regulations. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be onerous and expensive, and requirements differ among jurisdictions.  New laws, changes in existing laws and abrogation of local regulations by national laws result in significant uncertainties in how they will be interpreted and enforced. Failure to comply with any of these foreign laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We May Encounter Substantial CompetitionWe may encounter substantial competition from other companies in the same market, including established companies with significant resources. Some of our competitors may have financial, technical, marketing or other capabilities that are more extensive than ours.  They may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and other competitive pressures. We may not be able to compete successfully against our present or future competitors.  Our failure to effectively compete could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.Our Competitive Position May Require Significant Investments in Strategic AcquisitionsWe continuously monitor the marketplace for strategic opportunities, and our business strategy includes expanding our product lines and markets through both internal product development and acquisitions.  Consequently, we expect to continue to consider strategic acquisition of businesses, products or technologies complementary to our business.  This may require significant investments of management time and financial resources.  If market demand is outside our organic capabilities, if a strategic acquisition is required and we cannot identify one or execute on it, and/or if the financial investments do not result in a significant return on investment or the ability to serve our credit facility covenants due to inability to integrate the business, retain staff, or work with the customers, we could suffer a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Declines in the Operating Performance of One of Our Business Segments Could Result in an Impairment of the Segment’s Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets As of June 30, 2016, we had goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets of approximately $233.8 million and $14.1 million, respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, we test our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or when an indication of possible impairment exists, to determine whether the carrying value of our assets is still supported by the fair value of the underlying business. To the extent that it is not, we are required to record an impairment charge to reduce the asset to fair value. A decline in the operating performance of any of our business segments could result in an impairment charge which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. There Are Limitations on the Protection of Our Intellectual Property We rely on a combination of trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws combined with employee confidentiality, noncompetition and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance that the steps taken by us will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or intellectual property. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that third-parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future. Asserting our intellectual property rights or defending against third-party claims could involve substantial expense.  In the event a third-party were successful in a claim that one of our processes infringed its proprietary rights, we could be required to pay substantial damages or royalties, or spend substantial amounts in order to obtain a license or modify processes so that they no longer infringe such proprietary rights.  Any such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 20 We Are Subject to Governmental Import and Export Regulations We are subject to the passage of and changes in the interpretation of regulation by U.S. government entities at the federal, state and local levels and non-U.S. agencies, including, but not limited to, the following:  ·We are required to comply with import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons, including dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies.  We may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item.  Compliance with the import laws that apply to our businesses may restrict our access to, and may increase the cost of obtaining, certain products and could interrupt our supply of imported inventory.  ·Exported technologies necessary to develop and manufacture certain products are subject to U.S. export control laws and similar laws of other jurisdictions.  We may be subject to adverse regulatory consequences, including government oversight of facilities and export transactions, monetary penalties and other sanctions for violations of these laws. In certain instances, these regulations may prohibit the Company from developing or manufacturing certain of its products for specific end applications outside the U.S. Failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation. We Have Agreements with Government EntitiesOur agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination, reduction or modification in the event of changes in government requirements, reductions in federal spending and other factors. We are also subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements of government contracts, including procurement integrity, export control, employment practices, the accuracy of records and the recording of costs.  Failure to comply with these requirements might result in suspension of these contracts and suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting.We Use and Generate Hazardous Substances that Are Subject to Stringent Environmental Regulations Hazardous substances used or generated in our research and manufacturing facilities are subject to stringent environmental regulation. We believe that our handling of such substances is in material compliance with applicable local, state and federal environmental, safety and health regulations at each operating location. We invest substantially in proper protective equipment, process controls and specialized training to minimize risks to employees, surrounding communities and the environment that could result from the presence and handling of such hazardous substances. We regularly conduct employee physical examinations and workplace monitoring regarding such substances. When exposure problems or potential exposure problems have been uncovered, corrective actions have been implemented and re-occurrence has been minimal or non-existent. We have in place an emergency response plan with respect to our generation and use of the hazardous substance Hydrogen Selenide. Special attention has been given to all procedures pertaining to this gaseous material to minimize the chances of its accidental release into the atmosphere. With respect to the manufacturing, use, storage and disposal of the low-level radioactive material Thorium Fluoride, our facilities and procedures have been inspected and licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Thorium-bearing by-products are collected and shipped as solid waste to a government-approved low-level radioactive waste disposal site in Clive, Utah. The generation, use, collection, storage and disposal of all other hazardous by-products, such as suspended solids containing heavy metals or airborne particulates, are believed by us to be in material compliance with regulations. We believe that we have obtained all of the permits and licenses required for operation of our business. We do not carry environmental impairment insurance. And, although we do not know of any material environmental, safety or health problems in our properties or processes, there can be no assurance that problems will not develop in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We May Be Adversely Affected by Climate Change Regulations In many of the countries in which we operate, government bodies are increasingly enacting legislation and regulations in response to potential impacts of climate change. These laws and regulations may be mandatory. They have the potential to impact our operations directly or indirectly as a result of required compliance by our customers or our supply chain. Inconsistency of regulations may also affect the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations. Assessments of the potential impact of future climate change legislation, regulation and international treaties and accords are uncertain, given the wide scope of potential regulatory change in countries in which we operate. 21 We may incur increased capital expenditures resulting from required compliance with revised or new legislation or regulations, added costs to purchase or lower profits from sales of our products, allowances or credits under a “cap and trade” system, increased insurance premiums and deductibles as new actuarial tables are developed to reshape coverage, a change in competitive position relative to industry peers, and changes to profit or loss arising from increased or decreased demand for goods produced by us and indirectly, from changes in costs of goods sold. Data Breach Incidents and Breakdown of Information and Communication Technologies Could Disrupt our Operations and Impact Our Financial Results In the course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property both proprietary and of our customers, as well as proprietary business information. We could be subject to service outages or breaches of security systems which may result in disruption, unauthorized access, misappropriation, or corruption of this information. Security breaches of our network or data including physical or electronic break-ins, vendor service outages, computer viruses, attacks by hackers or similar breaches can create system disruptions, shutdowns, or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Although we have not experienced an incident, if we are unable to prevent such security or privacy breaches, our operations would be disrupted or we could suffer legal claims, loss of reputation, financial loss, property damage, or regulatory penalties because of lost or misappropriated information. Some Systems That Use our Products Are Complex in Design and May Contain Defects that Are Not Detected Until Deployed Which Could Increase Our Costs and Reduce Our Revenues Some systems that use our products are inherently complex in design and require ongoing maintenance. Our customers may discover defects in our products after the products have been fully deployed and operated under peak stress conditions. In addition, some of our products are combined with products from other vendors which may contain defects. Should problems occur, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. If we are unable to correct defects or other problems, we could experience, among other things loss of customers, increased costs of product returns and warranty expenses, damage to our brand reputation, failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance, diversion of development and engineering resources, or legal action by our customers. The occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Significant Defense Spending Cuts and/or Reductions in Defense Programs Could Adversely Impact Our Business Specific to the military business within our II-VI Laser Solutions and II-VI Performance Products segments, sales to customers in the defense industry totaled approximately 12% of revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016. These customers generally contract with a governmental entity, typically a U.S. governmental agency. Future reductions in defense spending could result from the current or future economic or political environment.  For example, the ongoing sequestration of the defense budget could result in reductions in demand for defense-related products that we produce. Further, changes to existing defense procurement laws and regulations could adversely affect our results of operations.  Most governmental programs are subject to funding approval and can be modified or terminated with no warning upon the determination of a legislative or administrative body. The loss of or failure to obtain certain contracts or the loss of a major government customer could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Changes in Tax Rates, Tax Liabilities or Tax Accounting Rules Could Affect Future Results As a global company, we are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various other countries and jurisdictions. As such, we must exercise a level of judgment in determining our worldwide tax liabilities. Our future tax rates could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in countries with differing tax rates or changes in tax laws. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significantly adverse impact on our effective tax rate. For example, proposals for fundamental U.S. international tax reform, if enacted, could have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate. In addition, we are subject to regular examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provision and accruals, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operation or financial condition. Our Success Depends on Our Ability to Retain Key Personnel We are highly dependent upon the experience and continuing services of certain scientists, engineers, production and management personnel. Competition for the services of these personnel is intense.  There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain or 22 attract the personnel necessary for our success. The loss of the services of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Natural Disasters or Other Global or Regional Catastrophic Events Could Disrupt Our Operations and Adversely Affect Our Results We may be exposed to business interruptions due to catastrophe, natural disaster, pandemic, terrorism or acts of war that are beyond our control. Disruptions to our facilities or systems, or to those of our key suppliers, could also interrupt operational processes and adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products and provide services and support to our customers. As a result, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. A Significant Portion of Our Business is Dependent on Cyclical Industries Our business is significantly dependent on the demand for products produced by end-users of industrial lasers and optical communication products. Many of these end-users are in industries that have historically experienced a highly cyclical demand for their products. As a result, demand for our products is subject to these cyclical fluctuations. Fluctuations in demand could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Increases in Commodity Prices May Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of increases in commodity prices. Our businesses purchase, produce and sell high purity selenium and other raw materials based upon quoted market prices from minor metal exchanges. The negative impact from increases in commodity prices may not be recovered through our product sales which could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings and financial condition. Regulations Related to Conflict Minerals Could Adversely Impact Our Business The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contain provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of gold, columbite-tantalite (coltan), cassiterite and wolframite, including their derivatives, which are limited to tantalum, tin and tungsten, known as “conflict minerals,” originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries (collectively known as the ""covered countries""). Pursuant to these rules, the SEC has adopted certain annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies that use conflict minerals in their products, regardless of whether such minerals were mined from the covered countries, compliance with which began in 2014. We could incur significant costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including costs related to our due diligence efforts to determine the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products. These rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials we use in our products, particularly if there are only a limited number of suppliers offering conflict minerals that are from recycled or scrap sources, cannot be traced to a country of origin other than the covered countries, or cannot be traced to a source within the covered countries that does not finance or benefit armed groups in those countries. We cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain products from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain conflict minerals originating from the covered countries and we cannot definitively determine whether the conflict minerals financed or otherwise benefited armed groups, or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of all of the conflict minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures we implement. The Market Price of Our Common Stock Can Be Highly Volatile Factors that could cause fluctuation in our stock price include, among other things, general economic and market conditions, actual or anticipated variations in operating results, changes in financial estimates by securities analysts, our inability to meet or exceed securities analysts’ estimates or expectations, conditions or trends in the industries in which our products are purchased, announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, divestitures, joint ventures or other strategic initiatives, capital commitments, additions or departures of key personnel and sales of our Common Stock. Many of these factors are beyond our control. However, these factors could cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline, regardless of our actual operating performance. Provisions in Our Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws May Limit the Price that Investors May be Willing to Pay in the Future for Shares of Our Common Stock Our Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws contain provisions that could make us a less attractive target for a hostile takeover and could make more difficult or discourage a merger proposal, a tender offer or a proxy contest. Such provisions include: 23  ·A requirement that shareholder-nominated director nominees be nominated in advance of the meeting at which directors are elected and that specific information be provided in connection with such nomination;   ·The ability of the board of directors to issue additional shares of Common Stock or preferred stock without shareholder approval; and  ·Certain provisions requiring supermajority approval (at least two-thirds of the votes cast by all shareholders entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class). In addition, the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law contains provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company. All of these provisions may limit the price that investors may be willing to pay for shares of our Common Stock. Because We Do Not Currently Intend to Pay Dividends, Shareholders Will Benefit From an Investment in our Common Stock Only if it Appreciates in Value We have never declared or paid any dividends on our Common Stock, and do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.  We currently anticipate that we will retain any future earnings to support operations and to finance the development of our business. As a result, the success of an investment in our Common Stock will depend entirely upon future appreciation in its value. There is no guarantee that our Common Stock will maintain its value or appreciate in value.  "
3,COHR,COHERENT INC,2015-08-28,">Item 1A.RISK FACTORS The Company cautions investors that its performance and, therefore, any forward-looking statement, is subject to risks and uncertainties. The following material risk factors may cause the Company’s future results to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. You should carefully consider these factors, as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K when evaluating an investment in our securities. Our Future Success Depends on International Sales and Successful Management of Global Operations Sales to customers in countries other than the U.S. accounted for approximately 63%, 65% and 56% of revenues during the years ended June 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. In addition, we manufacture products in China, Singapore, Vietnam, the Philippines, Germany, and Switzerland, and through contract manufacturers in Thailand and China, and maintain direct sales offices in Hong Kong, Japan, Germany, Switzerland, the U.K., Belgium, China, Singapore, Italy and South Korea. Sales and operations outside of the U.S. are subject to certain inherent risks, including fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies, global economic uncertainties, tariffs, quotas, taxes and other market barriers, political and economic instability, restrictions on the export or import of technology, potentially limited intellectual property protection, difficulties in staffing and managing international operations and potentially adverse tax consequences, and required compliance with U.S.- and non-U.S. laws and regulations.  More specifically, we are subject to laws and regulations worldwide affecting our operations outside the U.S. in areas including, but not limited to, IP ownership and infringement, tax, customs, import and export requirements, anti-corruption and anti-bribery, foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions, foreign investment, data privacy requirements, anti-competition, pensions and social insurance, employment, and environment, health, and safety. Compliance with these laws and regulations may be onerous and expensive and requirements may differ among jurisdictions.  Further, the promulgation of new laws, changing in existing laws and abrogation of local regulations by national laws may have a negative impact on our business and prospects.  In addition, certain laws and regulations are relatively new and their interpretation and enforcement involve significant uncertainties. There can be no assurance that any of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Our Continued Success Depends on Our Ability to Develop New Products and Processes In order to meet our strategic objectives, we must continue to develop, manufacture and market new products, develop new processes and improve existing processes. As a result, we expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development and to continue to consider from time to time the strategic acquisition of businesses, products or technologies complementary to our business. Our success in developing, introducing and selling new and enhanced products depends upon a variety of factors including product selection, timely and efficient completion of product design and development, timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing and assembly processes, effective sales and marketing and product performance in the field. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new products or enhancements to our existing products and processes in a manner which satisfies customer needs or achieves market acceptance. The failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business.  Keeping Pace with Key Industry Developments is Essential The introduction of products or processes utilizing new developments could render existing products or processes obsolete or unmarketable. Our continued success will depend upon our ability to develop and introduce, in a timely and cost-effective manner, new products, processes and applications that keep pace with developments and address increasingly sophisticated customer requirements. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying, developing and marketing new products, applications and processes and that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of product or process enhancements or new products, applications or processes, or that our products, applications or processes will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance. Our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if we were to incur delays in developing new products, applications or processes or if they do not achieve market acceptance.We May Expand Product Lines and Markets by Acquiring Other Businesses, Which May Adversely Affect our Results and Affect the Value of our Stock Following Such Acquisitions  Our business strategy includes expanding our product lines and markets through both internal product development and acquisitions.  We have completed various acquisitions in recent years and the success of these acquisitions will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits from integrating and successfully running the businesses acquired.  The strategic acquisition of businesses, products or technologies complementary to our business involves numerous potential risks, including difficulties in the assimilation of the acquired business and products, uncertainties associated with operating in new markets, working with new customers and the potential loss of the acquired company’s key personnel.  In addition, acquired businesses may experience operating 19 losses as of, and subsequent to, the acquisition date. Further, we significantly increased our long-term debt to finance these acquisitions, the costs of which (in terms of interest expense and similar debt service costs), must be weighed against the potential benefits of such acquisitions. The anticipated benefits and cost savings of an acquisition may not be realized fully, or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, and as a result our results of operations, financial position, and cash flow may be adversely affected.  Further, any future business acquisitions completed by us may result in potentially dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.Declines in the Operating Performance of One of Our Business Segments Could Result in an Impairment of the Segment’s Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets As of June 30, 2015, we had goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets of approximately $195.9 million and $14.4 million, respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. In accordance with applicable accounting guidance, we test our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or when an indication of possible impairment exists, to determine whether the carrying value of our assets is still supported by the fair value of the underlying business. To the extent that it is not, we are required to record an impairment charge to reduce the asset to fair value. A decline in the operating performance of any of our business segments could result in an impairment charge which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. General Global Economic Conditions May Adversely Affect Our Business, Operating Results and Financial Condition Current and future conditions in the global economy have an inherent degree of uncertainty. As a result, it is difficult to estimate the level of growth or contraction for the global economy as a whole. It is even more difficult to estimate growth or contraction in various parts, sectors and regions of the economy, including industrial, military, optical communications, telecommunications, semiconductor, and medical and life science markets in which we participate. Because all components of our forecasting are dependent upon estimates of growth or contraction in the markets we serve and demand for our products, the prevailing global economic uncertainties render estimates of future income and expenditures very difficult to make. In addition, changes in general economic conditions may affect industries in which our customers operate. These changes could include decreases in the rate of consumption or use of our customers’ products due to economic downturn, and such conditions could have a material adverse effect on demand for our customers’ products, and in turn, on demand for our products. Adverse changes may occur in the future as a result of declining or flat global or regional economic conditions, fluctuations in currency and commodity prices, wavering confidence, capital expenditure reductions, unemployment, decline in stock markets, contraction of credit availability or other factors affecting economic conditions. For example, factors that may affect our operating results include disruptions to the credit and financial markets in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere; adverse effects of ongoing stagnation in the European economy; slowdown in the Chinese economy; contractions or limited growth in consumer spending or consumer credit; and adverse economic conditions that may be specific to the Internet, e-commerce and payments industries. These changes may negatively affect sales of products, increase exposure to losses from bad debt and commodity prices, increase the cost and availability of financing and increase costs associated with manufacturing and distributing products. Any economic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. There Are Limitations on the Protection of Our Intellectual Property We rely on a combination of trade secret, patent, copyright and trademark laws combined with employee noncompetition and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance that the steps taken by us will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or intellectual property. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that third-parties will not assert infringement claims against us in the future. Asserting our intellectual property rights or defending against third-party claims could involve substantial expense, thus materially and adversely affecting our business, results of operations or financial condition. In the event a third-party were successful in a claim that one of our processes infringed its proprietary rights, we could be required to pay substantial damages or royalties, or expend substantial amounts in order to obtain a license or modify processes so that they no longer infringe such proprietary rights, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We Are Subject to Governmental Regulation We are subject to the passage of and changes in the interpretation of regulation by U.S. government entities at the federal, state and local levels and non-U.S. agencies, including, but not limited to, the following: ·We are required to comply with various import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons, including in certain cases dealings with or 20 between our employees and subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies, and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item. Compliance with the various import laws that apply to our businesses may restrict our access to, and may increase the cost of obtaining, certain products and could interrupt our supply of imported inventory. ·Exported technology necessary to develop and manufacture certain Company products are subject to U.S. export control laws and similar laws of other jurisdictions, and the Company may be subject to adverse regulatory consequences, including government oversight of facilities and export transactions, monetary penalties and other sanctions for violations of these laws. In certain instances, these regulations may prohibit the Company from developing or manufacturing certain of its products for specific end applications outside the U.S. ·Our agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination, reduction or modification in the event of changes in government requirements, reductions in federal spending and other factors. We are also subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements of government contracts, including requirements related to procurement integrity, export control, employment practices, the accuracy of records and the recording of costs. A failure to comply with these requirements might result in suspension of these contracts and suspension or debarment from government contracting or subcontracting. In addition, failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation. We Are Subject to Stringent Environmental Regulation We use or generate certain hazardous substances in our research and manufacturing facilities. We believe that our handling of such substances is in material compliance with applicable local, state and federal environmental, safety and health regulations at each operating location. We invest substantially in proper protective equipment, process controls and specialized training to minimize risks to employees, surrounding communities and the environment resulting from the presence and handling of such hazardous substances. We regularly conduct employee physical examinations and workplace monitoring regarding such substances. When exposure problems or potential exposure problems have been uncovered, corrective actions have been implemented and re-occurrence has been minimal or non-existent. We do not carry environmental impairment insurance. We have in place an emergency response plan with respect to our generation and use of the hazardous substance Hydrogen Selenide. Special attention has been given to all procedures pertaining to this gaseous material to minimize the chances of its accidental release into the atmosphere. With respect to the manufacturing, use, storage and disposal of the low-level radioactive material Thorium Fluoride, our facilities and procedures have been inspected and licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Thorium-bearing by-products are collected and shipped as solid waste to a government-approved low-level radioactive waste disposal site in Clive, Utah. The generation, use, collection, storage and disposal of all other hazardous by-products, such as suspended solids containing heavy metals or airborne particulates, are believed by us to be in material compliance with regulations. We believe that we have obtained all of the permits and licenses required for operation of our business. Although we do not know of any material environmental, safety or health problems in our properties or processes, there can be no assurance that problems will not develop in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We May Be Adversely Affected by Climate Change RegulationIn many of the countries in which we operate, government bodies are increasingly enacting or contemplating enacting legislation and regulations in response to potential impacts of climate change. These laws and regulations may be mandatory or voluntary, and have the potential to impact our operations directly or indirectly through implications on our customers or our supply chain. Inconsistency of regulations may also affect the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations. Assessments of the potential impact of future climate change legislation, regulation and international treaties and accords are uncertain, given the wide scope of potential regulatory change in countries in which we operate. We may incur increased capital expenditures resulting from required compliance with revised or new legislation or regulations, costs to purchase or profits from sales of, allowances or credits under a “cap and trade” system, increased insurance premiums and deductibles as new actuarial tables are developed to reshape coverage, a change in competitive position relative to industry peers and changes to profit or loss arising from increased or decreased demand for goods produced by us and indirectly, from changes in costs of goods sold.21 Regulations Related to Conflict Minerals Could Adversely Impact Our Business. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contain provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of gold, columbite-tantalite (coltan), cassiterite and wolframite, including their derivatives, which are limited to tantalum, tin and tungsten, known as “conflict minerals,” originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries (collectively known as the ""covered countries""). Pursuant to these rules, the SEC has adopted certain annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies that use conflict minerals in their products, regardless of whether such minerals were mined from the covered countries, compliance with which began in 2014. We could incur significant costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including costs related to our due diligence efforts to determine the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products. These rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials we use in our products, particularly if it turns out that there are only a limited number of suppliers offering conflict minerals that are not from recycled or scrap sources, can be traced to a country of origin other than the covered countries, or can be traced to a source within the covered countries that definitely does not finance or benefit armed groups in those countries. We cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain products from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain conflict minerals originating from the covered countries and we cannot definitively determine whether the conflict minerals financed or otherwise benefited armed groups, or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of all of the conflict minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures we implement. Data Breach Incidents and Breakdown of Information and Communication Technologies Could Disrupt our Operations and Impact Our Financial Results In the course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property [both proprietary and of our customers], as well as proprietary business information. We could be subject to service outages or breaches of security systems which may result in disruption, unauthorized access, misappropriation, or corruption of this information. Security breaches of our network or data including physical or electronic break-ins, vendor service outages, computer viruses, attacks by hackers or similar breaches can create system disruptions, shutdowns, or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Although we have not experienced an incident, if we are unable to prevent such security or privacy breaches, our operations could be disrupted or we may suffer legal claims, loss of reputation, financial loss, property damage, or regulatory penalties because of lost or misappropriated information. We Depend on Highly Complex Manufacturing Processes That Require Products from Limited Sources of Supply We utilize high-quality, optical grade zinc selenide (ZnSe) in the production of many of our infrared optical products. We are the leading producer of ZnSe for our internal use and for external sale. The production of ZnSe is a complex process requiring a highly controlled environment. A number of factors, including defective or contaminated materials, could adversely affect our ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields of high quality ZnSe. No proven external sources of ZnSe are currently available. Lack of adequate availability of high quality ZnSe could have a material adverse effect upon us. There can be no assurance that we will not experience manufacturing yield inefficiencies which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We produce Hydrogen Selenide gas which is used in our production of ZnSe. There are risks inherent in the production and handling of such material. Our lack of proper handling of Hydrogen Selenide could require us to curtail our production of Hydrogen Selenide. Hydrogen Selenide is available from only one outside source whose quantities and quality may be limited. The cost of purchasing such material is greater than the cost of internal production. As a result, the purchase of a substantial portion of such material from the outside source would increase our ZnSe production costs. Therefore, our inability to internally produce Hydrogen Selenide could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, we produce and utilize other high purity and relatively uncommon materials and compounds to manufacture our products including, but not limited to, Zinc Sulfide (ZnS), Yttrium Aluminum Garnet (YAG), Yttrium Lithium Fluoride (YLF), Calcium Fluoride (CaF2), Germanium (Ge), Selenium (Se), Telluride (Te), Bismuth Telluride (Bi2Te3) and Silicon Carbide (SiC). A significant failure of our internal production processes or our suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of these necessary materials on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Some Systems That Utilize our Products Are Complex in Design and May Contain Defects that Are Not Detected Until Deployed Which Could Increase Our Costs and Reduce Our Revenues Some systems that utilize our products are inherently complex in design and require ongoing maintenance. Our customers may discover defects in our products after the products have been fully deployed and operated under peak stress conditions. In addition, some of our products are combined with products from other vendors, and these third-party products may contain defects. Should problems occur, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. If we are unable to correct defects or other problems, we could experience, among other things: loss of customers; increased costs of product returns and warranty expenses; damage to our 22 brand reputation; failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance; diversion of development and engineering resources; or legal action by our customers. The occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Continued U.S. Budget Deficits Could Result in Significant Defense Spending Cuts and/or Reductions in Defense Programs, which Could Adversely Impact the CompanySpecific to the military business within our II-VI Laser Solutions and II-VI Performance Products segments, sales to customers in the defense industry totaled approximately 12% of revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015. These customers in turn generally contract with a governmental entity, typically a U.S. governmental agency. Future reductions in defense spending could result from the current or future economic or political environment, such as the ongoing sequestration of the defense budget, which could result in reductions in demand for defense-related products that we produce. Further, changes to existing defense procurement laws and regulations could adversely affect our results of operations.  Most governmental programs are subject to funding approval and can be modified or terminated with no warning upon the determination of a legislative or administrative body. The loss of or failure to obtain certain contracts or the loss of a major government customer could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Changes in Tax Rates, Tax Liabilities or Tax Accounting Rules Could Affect Future Results As a global company, we are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various other countries and jurisdictions. As such, we must exercise a level of judgment in determining our worldwide tax liabilities. Our future tax rates could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in countries with differing tax rates or changes in tax laws. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significantly adverse impact on our effective tax rate. For example, proposals for fundamental U.S. international tax reform, if enacted, could have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate. In addition, we are subject to regular examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provision and accruals, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operation or financial condition. We May Encounter Substantial Competition We may encounter substantial competition from other companies in the same market, including established companies with significant resources. Some of our competitors may have financial, technical, marketing or other capabilities that are more extensive than ours and may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and other competitive pressures. We may not be able to compete successfully against our present or future competitors, and such competition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Our Success Depends on Our Ability to Retain Key Personnel We are highly dependent upon the experience and continuing services of certain scientists, engineers, production and management personnel. Competition for the services of these personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain or attract the personnel necessary for our success. The loss of the services of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Natural Disasters or Other Global or Regional Catastrophic Events Could Disrupt Our Operations and Adversely Affect Results We may be exposed to business interruptions due to catastrophe, natural disaster, pandemic, terrorism or acts of war that are beyond our control. Disruptions to our facilities or systems, or to those of our key suppliers, could also interrupt operational processes and adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products and provide services and support to our customers. As a result, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected. A Significant Portion of Our Business is Dependent on Cyclical Industries Our business is significantly dependent on the demand for products produced by end-users of industrial lasers and optical communication products. Many of these end-users are in industries that have historically experienced a highly cyclical demand for their products. As a result, demand for our products is subject to these cyclical fluctuations. This cyclical demand could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. 23 Commodity Prices May Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in commodity prices. Our businesses purchase, produce and sell high purity selenium and other raw materials based upon quoted market prices from minor metal exchanges. As a result, the negative impact from changes in commodity prices may not be recovered through our product sales, and as such could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings and financial condition. The Market Price of Our Common Stock Can Be Highly Volatile Factors that could cause fluctuation in our stock price include, among other things: general economic and market conditions; actual or anticipated variations in operating results; changes in financial estimates by securities analysts; our inability to meet or exceed securities analysts’ estimates or expectations; conditions or trends in the industries in which our products are purchased; announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, divestitures, joint ventures or other strategic initiatives; capital commitments; additions or departures of key personnel; and sales of our Common Stock. Many of these factors are beyond our control. These factors could cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline, regardless of our actual operating performance. Provisions in Our Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws May Limit the Price that Investors May be Willing to Pay in the Future for Shares of Our Common Stock Our Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws contain provisions that could make us a less attractive target for a hostile takeover and could make more difficult or discourage a merger proposal, a tender offer or a proxy contest. Such provisions include: a requirement that shareholder-nominated director nominees be nominated in advance of the meeting at which directors are elected and that specific information be provided in connection with such nomination; the ability of the board of directors to issue additional shares of Common Stock or preferred stock without shareholder approval; and certain provisions requiring supermajority approval (at least two-thirds of the votes cast by all shareholders entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class). In addition, the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law contains provisions that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company. All of these provisions may limit the price that investors may be willing to pay for shares of our Common Stock. Because We Do Not Currently Intend to Pay Dividends, Shareholders Will Benefit From an Investment in our Common Stock Only if it Appreciates in Value We have never declared or paid any dividends on our Common Stock, and do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future, as we currently anticipate that we will retain any future earnings to support operations and to finance the development of our business. As a result, the success of an investment in our Common Stock will depend entirely upon any future appreciation in its value. There is no guarantee that our Common Stock will maintain its value or appreciate in value. 24 RECENTLY ISSUED FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDSIn July 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued an Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) 2015-11, Inventory (Topic 330): Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory. This update simplifies the measurement of inventory valuation at the lower of cost or net realizable value.  Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. The new inventory measurement requirements are effective for the Company’s 2018 fiscal year and will replace the current inventory valuation guidance that requires the use of a lower of cost or market framework. The adoption of these changes is not expected to have a material impact to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.In April 2015, the FASB issued as final, ASU 2015-05, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other - Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Fees Paid in a Cloud Computing Arrangement. This update provides guidance about whether a cloud computing arrangement includes a software license. The update is effective for annual reporting periods, including interim periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted. The update allows for the use of either a prospective or retrospective adoption approach. Management is currently evaluating the available transition methods and the potential impact of adoption on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.In April 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-03, Interest – Imputation of Interest: Simplifying the Presentation of Debt Issuance Costs.  This ASU requires entities to present debt issuance costs in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of the corresponding debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. The guidance does not address situations in which debt issuance costs do not have an associated debt liability or exceed the carrying amount of the associated debt liability. This ASU will be effective beginning in fiscal year 2017. Management is currently evaluating the potential impact of adoption on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.In February 2015, the FASB issued as final, ASU 2015-02, Consolidation (Topic 810): Amendments to the Consolidation Analysis, which affects reporting organizations that are required to evaluate whether they should consolidate certain legal entities. The update is effective for interim and annual reporting periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The update allows for the use of either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective adoption approach. Management is currently evaluating the available transition methods and the potential impact of adoption on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.In January 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-01, Income Statement - Extraordinary and Unusual Items. This ASU eliminates the requirement to separately present and disclose extraordinary and unusual items in the financial statements. This ASU will be effective beginning in 2016. The adoption of this ASU is not expected to have a material effect on our Consolidated Financial Statements.In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09: Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606) which supersedes virtually all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. The update's core principle is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The update allows for the use of either the retrospective or modified retrospective approach of adoption. On July 9, 2015 the FASB approved a one year deferral of the effective date of the update. The update is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2017 (the first quarter of our fiscal year 2019). We have not yet selected a transition method and are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements.In April 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-08: Reporting Discontinued Operations and Disclosures of Disposals of Components of an Entity, which changes the criteria for determining which disposals can be presented as discontinued operations and modifies related disclosure requirements. Under the new guidance, a discontinued operation is defined as a disposal of a component or group of components that is disposed of or is classified as held for sale and represents a strategic shift that has or will have a major effect on an entity's operations and financial results. The new standard will be effective for annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014, with early adoption permitted and will be effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2016. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.In July 2013, the FASB issued ASU 2013-11: Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax benefit when a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit carryforward Exists.  The ASU changes how certain unrecognized tax benefits are to be presented on the consolidated balance sheet. This ASU clarified existing guidance to require that an unrecognized tax benefit, or a portion thereof, be presented in the consolidated balance sheet as a reduction to a deferred tax asset for a net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforward, similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward, except when an NOL carryforward, similar tax loss, or tax credit carryforward is not available under the tax law of the applicable jurisdiction to settle any additional income taxes that would result from the disallowance of a tax position. In such a case, the unrecognized tax benefit would be presented in the consolidated balance sheet as a liability. This update was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2013 and was effective for the Company 25 for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2014. The adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements.  "
8,COHR,COHERENT INC,2013-08-28,">Item 1A.RISK FACTORS  The Company cautionsinvestors that its performance and, therefore, any forward-looking statement, is subject to risks and uncertainties. Various important factors including, but not limited to, the following may cause the Companys future results to differmaterially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. You should carefully consider these factors, as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K when evaluating an investment in our securities. General Global Economic Conditions May Adversely Affect Our Business, Operating Results and Financial Condition Current and future conditions in the global economy have an inherent degree of uncertainty. As a result, it is difficult to estimate the level of growthor contraction for the global economy as a whole. It is even more difficult to estimate growth or contraction in various parts, sectors and regions of the economy, including industrial, military, optical communications, telecommunications,semiconductor, photovoltaic and medical markets in which we participate. Because all components of our forecasting are dependent upon estimates of growth or contraction in the markets we serve and demand for our products, the prevailing globaleconomic uncertainties render estimates of future income and expenditures very difficult to make. In addition, changes in general economic conditions may affect industries in which our customers operate. These changes could include decreases in therate of consumption or use of our customers products due to economic downturn, and such conditions could have a material adverse effect on demand for our customers products and, in turn, on demand for our products. Adverse changes mayoccur in the future as a result of declining or flat global or regional economic conditions, fluctuations in currency and commodity prices, wavering confidence, capital expenditure reductions, unemployment, decline in stock markets, contraction ofcredit availability or other factors affecting economic conditions generally. For example, factors that may affect our operating results include disruptions to the credit and financial markets in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere; adverse effects ofthe ongoing sovereign debt crisis in Europe; contractions or limited growth in consumer spending or consumer credit; and adverse economic conditions that may be specific to the Internet, e-commerce and payments industries. These changes maynegatively affect sales of products, increase exposure to losses from bad debt and commodity prices, and increase the cost and availability of financing and increase costs associated with manufacturing and distributing products. Any economicdownturn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.  Our Future Success Depends onInternational Sales and Management of Global Operations  Sales to customers in countries other than the U.S. accounted for approximately57%, 60% and 59% of revenues during the years ended June 30, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. We anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. In addition,we manufacture products in China, Singapore, Vietnam, the Philippines, Germany and Australia and maintain direct sales offices in Japan, Germany, Switzerland, the U.K., Belgium, China, Singapore and Italy. Sales and operations outside of the U.S.are subject to certain inherent risks, including fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies, the current global economic uncertainties, tariffs, quotas, taxes and other market barriers, political and economicinstability, restrictions on the export or import of technology, potentially limited intellectual property protection, difficulties in staffing and managing international operations and potentially adverse tax consequences. There can be no assurancethat any of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In particular, currency exchange fluctuations in countries where we do business in the local currency could have amaterial adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition by rendering us less price-competitive than foreign manufacturers.   17 Commodity Prices May Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in commodity prices. Our businesses purchase, produce and sell high purityselenium and other raw materials based upon quoted market prices from minor metal exchanges. As a result, the negative impact from changes in commodity prices, such as the recent decline in global selenium prices which may not be recovered in ourproduct sales, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In the event that the global index price of selenium experiences a further decline from its current level, the Company would berequired to record an additional write-down of its selenium inventory in future periods.  Continued U.S. Budget Deficits and OngoingSequestration Could Result in Significant Defense Spending Cuts  Specific to the military business within our Infrared Optics,Military & Materials and Advanced Products Group segments, sales to customers in the defense industry totaled approximately 20% of revenues in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2013. These customers in turn generally contract with agovernmental entity, typically a U.S. governmental agency. Continued record U.S. Federal budget deficits and ongoing cuts resulting from sequestration could result in reductions in defense spending, which could result in delays and/orcancellations of major programs. Most governmental programs are subject to funding approval and can be modified or terminated with no warning upon the determination of a legislative or administrative body. The loss of or failure to obtain certaincontracts or the loss of a major government customer could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.  A Significant Portion of Our Business is Dependent on Other Cyclical Industries  Ourbusiness is significantly dependent on the demand for products produced by end-users of industrial lasers and optical communication products. Many of these end-users are in industries that have historically experienced a highly cyclical demand fortheir products. As a result, demand for our products is subject to cyclical fluctuations. This cyclical demand could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. There Are Limitations on the Protection of Our Intellectual Property  We rely on a combination of trade secrets, patents, copyright and trademark laws combined with employee noncompetition and nondisclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. There canbe no assurance that the steps taken by us will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or intellectual property. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that third-parties will not assert infringement claims against us in thefuture. Asserting our intellectual property rights or defending against third-party claims could involve substantial expense, thus materially and adversely affecting our business, results of operations or financial condition. In the event athird-party were successful in a claim that one of our processes infringed its proprietary rights, we could be required to pay substantial damages or royalties, or expend substantial amounts in order to obtain a license or modify processes so thatthey no longer infringe such proprietary rights, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.  We Depend on Highly Complex Manufacturing Processes Which Require Products from Limited Sources of Supply  We utilize high-quality, optical grade zinc selenide (ZnSe) in the production of many of our infrared optical products. We are the leading producer of ZnSe for our internal use and for external sale. Theproduction of ZnSe is a complex process requiring a highly controlled environment. A number of factors, including defective or contaminated materials, could adversely affect our ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields of high qualityZnSe. ZnSe is available from only one significant outside source whose quantities and quality of ZnSe   18 may be limited. Lack of adequate availability of high quality ZnSe would have a material adverse effect upon us. There can be no assurance that we will not experience manufacturing yieldinefficiencies which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.  We produce HydrogenSelenide gas which is used in our production of ZnSe. There are risks inherent in the production and handling of such material. Our lack of proper handling of Hydrogen Selenide could require us to curtail our production of Hydrogen Selenide.Hydrogen Selenide is available from only one outside source whose quantities and quality may be limited. The cost of purchasing such material is greater than the cost of internal production. As a result, the purchase of a substantial portion of suchmaterial from the outside source would increase our ZnSe production costs. Therefore, an inability to internally produce Hydrogen Selenide could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, we produce and utilize other high purity and relatively uncommon materials and compounds to manufacture ourproducts including, but not limited to, Zinc Sulfide (ZnS), Yttrium Aluminum Garnet (YAG), Yttrium Lithium Flouride (YLF), Calcium Flouride (CaF2), Germanium (Ge), Selenium (Se), Telluride (Te), Bismuth Telluride (Bi2Te3) and Silicon Carbide (SiC). A significant failure of our internal production processes or our suppliers to deliversufficient quantities of these necessary materials on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.  New Regulations Related to Conflict Minerals Could Adversely Impact our Business.  TheDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contain provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, originating from the Democratic Republic ofCongo (DRC) and adjoining countries. Pursuant to these rules, in August 2012 the SEC adopted certain annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies that use conflict minerals in their products, regardless of whether such mineralswere mined from the DRC and adjoining countries, beginning in May 2014. We could incur significant costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including costs related to our due diligence efforts to determine the sources ofany conflict minerals used in our products. These rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials we use in our products, if it turns out that there are only a limited number of suppliers offering conflict freeconflict minerals. We cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain conflict free products from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our productscontain conflict minerals which are not conflict free, or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of all of the conflict minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures we implement. We May Expand Product Lines and Markets by Acquiring Other Businesses  Our business strategy includes expanding our product lines and markets through internal product development and acquisitions. Any acquisition could result in potentially dilutive issuances of our equitysecurities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition,acquired businesses may experience operating losses as of, and subsequent to, the acquisition date. Any acquisition will involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the assimilation of the acquired companys operations and products,uncertainties associated with operating in new markets and working with new customers and the potential loss of the acquired companys key personnel.   19 The following information relates to acquisitions made during the periods presented in this Annual Report onForm 10-K.    Acquired Party  Year Acquired    Business Segments  PercentageOwnershipas ofJune 30, 2013  M Cubed Technologies, Inc.   Fiscal 2013    Advanced Products Group   100%  The Thin Film Filter business and Interleaver Product Line of Oclaro, Inc.   Fiscal 2013    Near-Infrared Optics   100%  LightWorks Optics, Inc.   Fiscal 2013    Military & Materials   100%  Aegis Lightwave, Inc.   Fiscal 2012    Near-Infrared Optics   100%  Max Levy Autograph, Inc.   Fiscal 2011    Military & Materials   100%  Some Systems Are Complex in Design and May Contain Defects that Are Not Detected Until Deployed Which Could IncreaseOur Costs and Reduce Our Revenues  Some systems that utilize our products are inherently complex in design and require ongoingmaintenance. As a result of the technical complexity of our products, changes in our or our suppliers manufacturing processes or the use of defective or contaminated materials by us or our suppliers could result in a material adverse effect onour ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields and product reliability. To the extent that we do not achieve acceptable yields or product reliability, our business, results of operation, financial condition or customer relationships could bematerially adversely affected.  Our customers may discover defects in our products after the products have been fully deployed and operatedunder peak stress conditions. In addition, some of our products are combined with products from other vendors, which may contain defects. Should problems occur, it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem. If we are unable to fixdefects or other problems, we could experience, among other things: loss of customers; increased costs of product returns and warranty expenses; damage to our brand reputation; failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance; diversionof development and engineering resources; or legal action by our customers. The occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We May Encounter Substantial Competition We may encounter substantial competition from other companies in the same market, including established companies with significant resources. Some of ourcompetitors may have financial, technical, marketing or other capabilities more extensive than ours and may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and other competitive pressures. We may not be able to competesuccessfully against our present or future competitors, and such competition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.  The Market Price of Our Common Stock and the Stock Market in General Can Be Highly Volatile Factors that could cause fluctuation in our stock price include, among other things: general economic and market conditions; actual or anticipatedvariations in operating results; changes in financial estimates by securities analysts; our inability to meet or exceed securities analysts estimates or expectations; conditions or trends in the industries in which our products are purchased;announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, divestitures, joint ventures or other strategic initiatives; capital commitments; additions or departures of key personnel; and sales of our Common Stock.  20 Many of these factors are beyond our control. These factors could cause the market price of our Common Stockto decline, regardless of our actual operating performance.  Because we do not Currently Intend to Pay Dividends, Shareholders Will BenefitFrom an Investment in our Common Stock Only if it Appreciates in Value  We have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock.We currently anticipate that we will retain any future earnings to support operations and to finance the development of our business and do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. As a result, the success of an investment in ourcommon stock will depend entirely upon any future appreciation in its value. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which a shareholder originally purchased its shares. Our Success Depends on Our Ability to Retain Key Personnel  We are highly dependent upon the experience and continuing services of certain scientists, engineers, production and management personnel. Competition for the services of these personnel is intense, andthere can be no assurance that we will be able to retain or attract the personnel necessary for our success. The loss of the services of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financialcondition.  Our Success Depends on New Products and Processes  In order to meet our strategic objectives, we must continue to develop, manufacture and market new products, develop new processes and improve existing processes. As a result, we expect to continue tomake significant investments in research and development and to continue to consider from time to time the strategic acquisition of businesses, products or technologies complementary to our business. Our success in developing, introducing andselling new and enhanced products depends upon a variety of factors including product selection, timely and efficient completion of product design and development, timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing and assembly processes,effective sales and marketing and product performance in the field. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop and introduce new products or enhancements to our existing products and processes in a manner which satisfies customerneeds or achieves market acceptance. The failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our ability to grow our business. Keeping Pace with Key Industry Developments is Essential  We are engaged in industries which will be affected by future developments. The introduction of products or processes utilizing new developments could render existing products or processes obsolete orunmarketable. Our continued success will depend upon our ability to develop and introduce, in a timely and cost-effective basis, new products, processes and applications that keep pace with developments and address increasingly sophisticatedcustomer requirements. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying, developing and marketing new products, applications and processes and that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successfuldevelopment, introduction and marketing of product or process enhancements or new products, applications or processes, or that our products, applications or processes will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve marketacceptance. Our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected if we were to incur delays in developing new products, applications or processes or if we do not gain market acceptance for the same. Changes in Tax Rates, Tax Liabilities or Tax Accounting Rules Could Affect Future Results As a global company, we are subject to taxation in the U.S. and various other countries and jurisdictions. As such, we must exercise a level of judgmentin determining our worldwide tax liabilities. Our future tax rates could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in countries with differing tax rates or changes in tax laws. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significantlyadverse impact on our effective tax rate. For   21 example, proposals for fundamental U.S. international tax reform, if enacted, could have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate. In addition, we are subject to regular examinationof our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for incometaxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provision and accruals, which couldmaterially and adversely affect our business, results of operation or financial condition.  Declines in the Operating Performance of One ofOur Business Segments Could Result in an Impairment of the Segments Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets  As ofJune 30, 2013, we had goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets of approximately $123.4 million and $16.4 million, respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We test our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets forimpairment on an annual basis or when an indication of possible impairment exists, to determine whether the carrying value of our assets is still supported by the fair value of the underlying business. To the extent that it is not, we are requiredto record an impairment charge to reduce the asset to fair value. A decline in the operating performance of any of our business segments could result in an impairment charge which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations orfinancial condition.  Provisions in Our Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws May Limit the Price that Investors May be Willing to Pay inthe Future for Shares of Our Common Stock  Our articles of incorporation and by-laws contain provisions which could make us a lessattractive target for a hostile takeover or make more difficult or discourage a merger proposal, a tender offer or a proxy contest. Such provisions include: classification of the board of directors into three classes; a requirement that shareholdernominated board nominees be nominated in advance of a meeting to elect such directors and that specific information be provided in connection with such nomination; the ability of the board of directors to issue additional shares of Common Stock orpreferred stock without shareholder approval; and certain provisions requiring supermajority approval (at least two-thirds of the votes cast by all shareholders entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class). In addition, thePennsylvania Business Corporation Law contains provisions which may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the Company. All of these provisions may limit the price that investors may be willing to pay for shares of ourCommon Stock.  We Are Subject to Stringent Environmental Regulation  We use or generate certain hazardous substances in our research and manufacturing facilities. We believe that our handling of such substances is in material compliance with applicable local, state andfederal environmental, safety and health regulations at each operating location. We invest substantially in proper protective equipment, process controls and specialized training to minimize risks to employees, surrounding communities and theenvironment resulting from the presence and handling of such hazardous substances. We regularly conduct employee physical examinations and workplace monitoring regarding such substances. When exposure problems or potential exposure problems havebeen uncovered, corrective actions have been implemented and re-occurrence has been minimal or non-existent. We do not carry environmental impairment insurance.  We have in place an emergency response plan with respect to our generation and use of the hazardous substance Hydrogen Selenide. Special attention has been given to all procedures pertaining to thisgaseous material to minimize the chances of its accidental release into the atmosphere.  With respect to the manufacturing, use, storage anddisposal of the low-level radioactive material Thorium Fluoride, our facilities and procedures have been inspected and licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Thorium-bearing by-products are collected and shipped as solid waste to agovernment-approved low-level radioactive waste disposal site in Clive, Utah.   22 The generation, use, collection, storage and disposal of all other hazardous by-products, such as suspendedsolids containing heavy metals or airborne particulates, are believed by us to be in material compliance with regulations. We believe that we have obtained all of the permits and licenses required for operation of our business. Although we do not know of any material environmental, safety or health problems in our properties or processes, there can be no assurance that problemswill not develop in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We Are Subject to Governmental Regulation  We are subject to extensive regulation by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental entities and other entities at the federal, state and local levels, including, but not limited to, the following:     We are required to comply with various import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certaincustomers, business partners and other persons, including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certainproducts, services and technologies, and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item. Compliance with the various import laws that apply to our businesses may restrict our access to, andmay increase the cost of obtaining, certain products and could interrupt our supply of imported inventory.      Exported technology necessary to develop and manufacture certain of the Companys products are subject to U.S. export control laws and similarlaws of other jurisdictions, and the Company may be subject to adverse regulatory consequences, including government oversight of facilities and export transactions, monetary penalties and other sanctions for violations of these laws. In many cases,exports of technology necessary to develop and manufacture the Companys products are subject to U.S. export control laws. In certain instances, these regulations may prohibit the Company from developing or manufacturing certain of its productsfor specific end applications outside the U.S.      Our agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination, reduction or modification in the event of changesin government requirements, reductions in federal spending and other factors. We are also subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements of government contracts, including requirements related to procurement integrity,export control, employment practices, the accuracy of records and the recording of costs. A failure to comply with these requirements might result in suspension of these contracts and suspension or debarment from government contracting orsubcontracting.  In addition, failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal,monetary and non-monetary penalties, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation.  Natural Disasters or Other Global or Regional Catastrophic Events Could Disrupt Our Operations and Adversely Affect Results  Despite our concerted effort to minimize risk to our production capabilities and corporate information systems and to reduce the effect of unforeseen interruptions to us through business continuityplanning, we still may be exposed to interruptions due to catastrophe, natural disaster, pandemic, terrorism or acts of war which are beyond our control. Disruptions to our facilities or systems, or to those of our key suppliers, could alsointerrupt operational processes and adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products and provide services and support to our customers. As a result, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adverselyaffected.   23 We Rely on Stable Information and Communication Technologies; Outages or Control Breakdowns Could Disruptour Operations and Impact Our Financial Results  We have in place a number of controls, processes and practices designed to protectagainst intentional or unintentional misappropriation or corruption of our networks, systems and information or disruption of our operations due to a cyber-incident. Despite such efforts, we could be subject to service outages or breaches ofsecurity systems which may result in disruption, unauthorized access, misappropriation, or corruption of the information we are trying to protect. Security breaches of our network or data including physical or electronic break-ins, vendor serviceoutages, computer viruses, attacks by hackers or similar breaches, can create system disruptions, shutdowns, or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. If we are unable to prevent such security or privacy breaches, our operations couldbe disrupted or we may suffer loss of reputation, financial loss, property damage, or regulatory penalties because of lost or misappropriated information.  Recently Issued Financial Accounting Standards  In March 2013, the FinancialAccounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an accounting standards update related to a parents accounting for the cumulative translation adjustment upon de-recognition of certain subsidiaries or groups of assets within a foreignentity or of an investment in a foreign entity. The update clarifies the applicable guidance under current U.S. generally accepted accounting principles for the release of the cumulative translation adjustment upon a reporting entitysde-recognition of a subsidiary or group of assets within a foreign entity or part or all of its investment in a foreign entity. The update requires a reporting entity, which either sells a part or all of its investment in a foreign entity or ceasesto have a controlling financial interest in a subsidiary or group of assets within a foreign entity, to release any related cumulative translation adjustment into net income. This update is effective prospectively for fiscal years beginning afterDecember 15, 2013 and will be effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2015. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In February 2013, the FASB issued an accounting standards update related to disclosure requirements of reclassifications out of accumulatedother comprehensive income. The adoption of the guidance requires the Company to provide information about the amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component. In addition, the Company is required to present, eitheron the face of the statement where net income is presented or in the notes, significant amounts reclassified from each component of accumulated other comprehensive income and the income statement line items affected by the reclassification. Thisupdate will be effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2014 and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In July 2012, the FASB issued an accountingstandards update related to impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets. The update simplified the guidance of testing for potential impairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill. The amendment provides entitiesthe option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform the quantitative impairment test. An entity electing to perform a qualitative assessment is no longer required to calculate the fair value of anindefinite-lived intangible asset unless the organization determines, based on a qualitative assessment, that it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the asset is impaired. The amendments in thisupdate are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012. Early adoption was permitted. The adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on the Companysconsolidated financial statements and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing.  In September 2011, the FASB issued an accountingstandards update related to goodwill impairment testing. The objective of the accounting standards update was to simplify how entities test goodwill for impairment by permitting an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is morelikely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. This update also allowed entities an unconditional optionto bypass this qualitative assessment and proceed directly to performing the first step of the goodwill impairment test. An entity   24 may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. This accounting standard update was effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscalyears beginning on or after December 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements and goodwill impairment testing. In June 2011, the FASB issued changes to the presentation of comprehensive income that require entities to present the total of comprehensive income, thecomponents of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. The option to present components of other comprehensive incomeas part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity is no longer permitted. This guidance, with retrospective application, was adopted by the Company in the first quarter of fiscal year 2013. Other than the change in presentation, thesechanges have had no impact on the consolidated financial statements and the calculation and presentation of earnings per share.   "
2,COHR,COHERENT INC,2012-08-28,">Item 1A.RISK FACTORS  The Company cautionsinvestors that its performance and, therefore, any forward-looking statement is subject to risks and uncertainties. Various important factors including, but not limited to, the following may cause the Companys future results to differmaterially from those projected in any forward-looking statement. You should carefully consider these factors, as well as the other information contained in this document when evaluating your investment in our securities. General Economic Conditions May Adversely Affect Our Business, Operating Results and Financial Condition Current and future conditions in the economy have an inherent degree of uncertainty. As a result, it is difficult to estimate the level of growth orcontraction for the economy as a whole. It is even more difficult to estimate growth or contraction in various parts, sectors and regions of the economy, including industrial, military, telecommunication, photovoltaic and medical markets in which weparticipate. Because all components of our forecasting are dependent upon estimates of growth or contraction in the markets we serve and demand for our products, the prevailing economic uncertainties render estimates of future income andexpenditures very difficult to make. In addition, changes in general economic conditions may affect industries in which our customers operate. These changes could include decreases in the rate of consumption or use of our customers productsdue to economic downturn. These conditions may have a material adverse effect on demand for our customers product and, in turn, on demand for our products. Adverse changes may occur in the future as a result of declining or flat global orregional economic conditions, fluctuations in currency and commodity prices, wavering confidence, capital expenditure reductions, unemployment, decline in stock markets, contraction of credit availability or other factors affecting economicconditions generally. For example, factors that may affect our operating results include disruptions to the credit and financial markets in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere; adverse effects of the ongoing sovereign debt crisis in Europe; contractionsor limited growth in consumer spending or consumer credit; and adverse economic conditions that may be specific to the Internet, e-commerce and payments industries. These changes may negatively affect sales of products, increase exposure to lossesfrom bad debt and commodity prices, and increase the cost and availability of financing and increase costs associated with manufacturing and distributing products. Any economic downturn or the failure to sustain the recent recovery from the globaleconomic downturn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.  Our Future SuccessDepends on International Sales and Management of Global Operations  Sales to customers in countries other than the U.S. accounted forapproximately 60%, 59% and 49% of revenues during the years ended June 30, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future.In addition, we manufacture products in China, Singapore, Vietnam, the Philippines, Germany and Australia and maintain direct sales offices in Japan, Germany, Switzerland, the U.K., Belgium, China, Singapore and Italy. Sales and operations outsideof the U.S. are subject to certain inherent risks, including fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies, the current global economic uncertainties, tariffs, quotas, taxes and other market barriers, political andeconomic instability, restrictions on the export or import of technology, potentially limited intellectual property protection, difficulties in staffing and managing international operations and potentially adverse tax consequences. There can be noassurance that any of these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In particular, currency exchange fluctuations in countries where we do business in the local currency couldhave a material adverse affect on our business, results of operations or financial condition by rendering us less price-competitive than foreign manufacturers. Our sales in Japan are denominated in Yen and, accordingly, are affected by fluctuationsin the U.S. dollar/Yen currency exchange rates. We generally reduce our exposure to such fluctuations of the Yen through forward exchange agreements which target to hedge approximately 75% of our sales in Japan. We do not engage in the speculativetrading of financial derivatives. There can be no assurance, however, that our practices will reduce or eliminate the risk of fluctuation of the U.S. dollar/Japanese Yen exchange rate.   16 Commodity Prices May Adversely Affect Our Results of Operations and Financial Condition We are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in commodity prices. Our businesses purchase, produce and sell high puritytellurium, selenium and other raw materials based upon quoted market prices from minor metal exchanges. As a result, the negative impact from changes in commodity prices such as the recent decline in global tellurium and selenium prices, which maynot be recovered in our product sales, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In the event that the global index price of tellurium or selenium experiences a further decline from itscurrent level, the Company would be required to record an additional write-down of its tellurium or selenium inventory in future periods. Continued U.S. Budget Deficits Could Result in Significant Defense Spending Cuts  Specific to the military business within our Infrared Optics, Near-Infrared Optics and Military & Materials segments, sales to customers in the defense industry totaled approximately 20% ofrevenues in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2012. These customers in turn generally contract with a governmental entity, typically a U.S. governmental agency. Continued record U.S. Federal budget deficits could result in significantpressure to reduce defense spending, which could result in delays and/or cancellations of major programs. Most governmental programs are subject to funding approval and can be modified or terminated with no warning upon the determination of alegislative or administrative body. The loss of or failure to obtain certain contracts or the loss of a major government customer could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. A Significant Portion of Our Business is Dependent on Other Cyclical Industries  Our business is significantly dependent on the demand for products produced by end-users of industrial lasers and optical communication products. Many of these end-users are in industries that havehistorically experienced a highly cyclical demand for their products. As a result, demand for our products is subject to cyclical fluctuations. This cyclical demand could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations orfinancial condition.  There Are Limitations on the Protection of Our Intellectual Property We rely on a combination of trade secrets, patents, copyright and trademark laws combined with employee noncompetition and nondisclosure agreements toprotect our intellectual property rights. There can be no assurance that the steps taken by us will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or intellectual property. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that third-parties willnot assert infringement claims against us in the future. Asserting our intellectual property rights or defending against third-party claims could involve substantial expense, thus materially and adversely affecting our business, results ofoperations or financial condition. In the event a third-party were successful in a claim that one of our processes infringed its proprietary rights, we could be required to pay substantial damages or royalties, or expend substantial amounts in orderto obtain a license or modify processes so that they no longer infringe such proprietary rights, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We Depend on Highly Complex Manufacturing Processes Which Require Products from Limited Sources of Supply We utilize high-quality, optical grade ZnSe in the production of many of our infrared optical products. We are the leading producer of ZnSe for ourinternal use and for external sale. The production of ZnSe is a complex process requiring a highly controlled environment. A number of factors, including defective or contaminated materials, could adversely affect our ability to achieve acceptablemanufacturing yields of high quality ZnSe. ZnSe is available from only one significant outside source whose quantities and quality of ZnSe may be limited.   17 Lack of adequate availability of high quality ZnSe would have a material adverse effect upon us. There can be no assurance that we will not experience manufacturing yield inefficiencies whichcould have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.  We produce Hydrogen Selenide gas which isused in our production of ZnSe. There are risks inherent in the production and handling of such material. Our lack of proper handling of Hydrogen Selenide could require us to curtail our production of Hydrogen Selenide. Hydrogen Selenide isavailable from only one outside source whose quantities and quality may be limited. The cost of purchasing such material is greater than the cost of internal production. As a result, the purchase of a substantial portion of such material from theoutside source would increase our ZnSe production costs. Therefore, an inability to internally produce Hydrogen Selenide could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, we produce and utilize other high purity and relatively uncommon materials and compounds to manufacture our productsincluding, but not limited to ZnS, YAG, YLF, CaF2, Ge, Se,Te, Bi2Te3 and SiC. A significant failure of our internal production processes orour suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of these necessary materials on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. We May Expand Product Lines and Markets by Acquiring Other Businesses  Our business strategy includes expanding our product lines and markets through internal product development and acquisitions. Any acquisition could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equitysecurities, the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities and amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Inaddition, acquired businesses may experience operating losses as of, and subsequent to, the acquisition date. Any acquisition will involve numerous risks, including difficulties in the assimilation of the acquired companys operations andproducts, uncertainties associated with operating in new markets and working with new customers and the potential loss of the acquired companys key personnel.  The following information relates to significant acquisitions made during the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10K.   Acquired Party  Year Acquired    Business Segments  PercentageOwnershipas ofJune 30, 2012  Aegis Lightwave Inc.   Fiscal 2012    Near-Infrared Optics   100%  Max Levy Autograph Inc.   Fiscal 2011    Military & Materials   100%  Photop Technologies, Inc.   Fiscal 2010    Near-Infrared Optics   100%  Some Systems Are Complex in Design and May Contain Defects that Are Not Detected Until Deployed Which Could IncreaseOur Costs and Reduce Our Revenues  Some systems that utilize our products are inherently complex in design and require ongoingmaintenance.

The occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing factors could have a material adverseeffect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.  We May Encounter Substantial Competition We may encounter substantial competition from other companies in the same market, including established companies with significant resources. Some of ourcompetitors may have financial, technical, marketing or other capabilities more extensive than ours and may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and other competitive pressures. We may not be able to competesuccessfully against our present or future competitors, and competition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.  The Market Price of Our Common Stock and the Stock Market in General Can Be Highly Volatile Factors that could cause fluctuation in our stock price include, among other things: general economic and market conditions; actual or anticipatedvariations in operating results; changes in financial estimates by securities analysts; our inability to meet or exceed securities analysts estimates or expectations; conditions or trends in the industries in which our products are purchased;announcements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, divestitures, joint ventures or other strategic initiatives; capital commitments; additions or departures of key personnel; and sales of our Common Stock. Many of these factors are beyond our control. These factors could cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline, regardless of ouroperating performance.  Our Success Depends on Our Ability to Retain Key Personnel We are highly dependent upon the experience and continuing services of certain scientists, engineers, production and management personnel. Competitionfor the services of these personnel is intense, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain or attract the personnel necessary for our success.

Keeping Pace with Key Industry Developments is Essential  We are engaged in industrieswhich will be affected by future developments. The introduction of products or processes utilizing new developments could render existing products or processes obsolete or unmarketable. Our continued success will depend upon our ability to developand introduce on a timely and cost-effective basis new   19 products, processes and applications that keep pace with developments and address increasingly sophisticated customer requirements. There can be no assurance that we will be successful inidentifying, developing and marketing new products, applications and processes and that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of product or process enhancements or newproducts, applications or processes, or that our products, applications or processes will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance. Our business, results of operations and financial condition could bematerially and adversely affected if we were to incur delays in developing new products, applications or processes or if we do not gain market acceptance for the same.  Changes in Tax Rates, Tax Liabilities or Tax Accounting Rules Could Affect Future Results As a global company, we are subject to taxation in the United States and various other countries and jurisdictions. As such, judgment is required todetermine worldwide tax liabilities. Our future tax rates could be affected by changes in the composition of earnings in countries with differing tax rates or changes in tax laws. Changes in tax laws or tax rulings may have a significantly adverseimpact on our effective tax rate. For example, proposals for fundamental U.S. international tax reform, if enacted, could have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate. In addition, we are subject to regular examination of our incometax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of favorable or unfavorable outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Although webelieve our tax estimates are reasonable, there can be no assurance that any final determination will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provision and accruals, which could materially and adverselyaffect our business, results of operation or financial condition.  Declines in the Operating Performance of One of Our Business SegmentsCould Result in an Impairment of the Segments Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets  As of June 30, 2012, we hadgoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets of approximately $80.7 million and $11.7 million, respectively, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We test our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis or whenan indication of possible impairment exists in order to determine whether the carrying value of our assets is still supported by the fair value of the underlying business. To the extent that it is not, we are required to record an impairment chargeto reduce the asset to fair value. A decline in the operating performance of any of our business segments could result in an impairment charge which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. Provisions in Our Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws May Limit the Price that Investors May be Willing to Pay in the Future for Sharesof Our Common Stock  Our articles of incorporation and by-laws contain provisions which could make us a less attractive target for ahostile takeover or make more difficult or discourage a merger proposal, a tender offer or a proxy contest. Such provisions include: classification of the board of directors into three classes; a procedure which requires shareholders or the board ofdirectors to nominate directors in advance of a meeting to elect such directors; the ability of the board of directors to issue additional shares of Common Stock or preferred stock without shareholder approval; and certain provisions requiringsupermajority approval (at least two-thirds of the votes cast by all shareholders entitled to vote thereon, voting together as a single class). In addition, the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law contains provisions which may have the effect ofdelaying or preventing a change in control of the Company. All of these provisions may limit the price that investors may be willing to pay for shares of our Common Stock.  We Are Subject to Stringent Environmental Regulation  We use or generate certain hazardoussubstances in our research and manufacturing facilities. We believe that our handling of such substances is in material compliance with applicable local, state and federal environmental, safety and health regulations at each operating location. Weinvest substantially in proper protective equipment,   20 process controls and specialized training to minimize risks to employees, surrounding communities and the environment resulting from the presence and handling of such hazardous substances. Weregularly conduct employee physical examinations and workplace monitoring regarding such substances. When exposure problems or potential exposure problems have been uncovered, corrective actions have been implemented and re-occurrence has beenminimal or non-existent. We do not carry environmental impairment insurance.  Relative to the generation and use of the hazardous substanceHydrogen Selenide, we have in place an emergency response plan. Special attention has been given to all procedures pertaining to this gaseous material to minimize the chances of its accidental release into the atmosphere. With respect to the manufacturing, use, storage and disposal of the low-level radioactive material Thorium Fluoride, our facilities and procedures havebeen inspected and licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Thorium-bearing by-products are collected and shipped as solid waste to a government-approved low-level radioactive waste disposal site in Clive, Utah. The generation, use, collection, storage and disposal of all other hazardous by-products, such as suspended solids containing heavy metals or airborneparticulates, are believed by us to be in material compliance with regulations. We believe that we have obtained all of the permits and licenses required for operation of our business.  Although we do not know of any material environmental, safety or health problems in our properties or processes, there can be no assurance that problems will not develop in the future which could have amaterial adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.  We Are Subject to Governmental Regulation We are subject to extensive regulation by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental entities and other entities at the federal, state and locallevels, including, but not limited to, the following:      We are required to comply with various import laws and export control and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certaincustomers, business partners and other persons, including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certainproducts, services and technologies, and in other circumstances we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item. Compliance with the various import laws that apply to our businesses can restrict our access to, andincrease the cost of obtaining, certain products and at times can interrupt our supply of imported inventory.      Exported technology necessary to develop and manufacture certain of the Companys products are subject to U.S. export control laws and similarlaws of other jurisdictions, and the Company may be subject to adverse regulatory consequences, including government oversight of facilities and export transactions, monetary penalties and other sanctions for violations of these laws. In many cases,exports of technology necessary to develop and manufacture the Companys products are subject to U.S. export control laws. In certain instances, these regulations may prohibit the Company from developing or manufacturing certain of its productsfor specific end applications outside the United States.      Our agreements relating to the sale of products to government entities may be subject to termination, reduction or modification in the event of changesin government requirements, reductions in federal spending and other factors. We are also subject to investigation and audit for compliance with the requirements of government contracts, including requirements related to procurement integrity,export control, employment practices, the accuracy of records and the recording of costs. A failure to comply with these requirements might result in suspension of these contracts and suspension or debarment from government contracting orsubcontracting.   21 In addition, failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal,monetary and non-monetary penalties, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to import and export products and services and damage to our reputation.  Natural Disasters or Other Global or Regional Catastrophic Events Could Disrupt Our Operations and Adversely Affect Results  Despite our concerted effort to minimize risk to our production capabilities and corporate information systems and to reduce the effect of unforeseen interruptions to us through business continuityplanning, we still may be exposed to interruptions due to catastrophe, natural disaster, pandemic, terrorism or acts of war, which are beyond our control, such as the March 2011 earthquake in Japan or the October 2011 flooding in Thailand.Disruptions to our facilities or systems, or to those of our key suppliers, could also interrupt operational processes and adversely impact our ability to manufacture our products and provide services and support to our customers. As a result, ourbusiness, results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected.  We Rely on Stable Information andCommunication Technologies and Outages or Control Breakdowns Could Disrupt our Operations and Impact Our Financial Results.

Despitesuch efforts, we could be subject to service outages or breaches of security systems which may result in disruption, unauthorized access, misappropriation, or corruption of the information we are trying to protect. Security breaches of our networkor data including physical or electronic break-ins, vendor service outages, computer viruses, attacks by hackers or similar breeches, can create system disruptions, shutdowns, or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. If we are unableto prevent such security or privacy breaches, our operations could be disrupted or we may suffer loss of reputation, financial loss, property damage, or regulatory penalties because of lost or misappropriated information. Recently Issued Financial Accounting Standards  In July 2012, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued an accounting standard update related to impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets. The update simplifiesthe guidance for testing the decline in the realizable value (impairment) of indefinite-lived intangible assets other than goodwill. The amendment allows entities the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary toperform the quantitative impairment test. An entity electing to perform a qualitative assessment is no longer required to calculate the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset unless the organization determines, based on a qualitativeassessment, that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. The amendments in this update are effective for annual and interim impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2012. Earlyadoption is permitted. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.  In September 2011, the FASB issued an accounting standard update related to goodwill impairment testing. The objective of the accounting standard update is to simplify how entities test goodwill forimpairment by permitting an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not (that is, a likelihood of more than 50 percent) that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis fordetermining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. This update also allows entities an unconditional option to bypass this qualitative assessment and proceed directly to performing the first step of the goodwillimpairment test. An entity may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. This accounting standard update is effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed for fiscal years beginning on or afterDecember 15, 2011, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.   22 In June 2011, the FASB issued changes to the presentation of comprehensive income which requires entities topresent the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. The option topresent components of other comprehensive income solely as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity will no longer be permitted. These changes will have no impact on the calculation and presentation of earnings per share. Thisguidance, with retrospective application, becomes effective for the Company for interim and annual periods beginning in fiscal year 2013. Other than the change in presentation, these changes are not expected to have an impact on the consolidatedfinancial statements.  In May 2011, the FASB issued an accounting standard update on fair value measurement and disclosure requirements. Theupdate amends certain fair value measurement guidance and expands disclosure requirements primarily for fair value measurements utilizing significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) and items not measured at fair value but for which fair value must bedisclosed. This update became effective for the Company for interim and annual reporting periods beginning in the third quarter of fiscal year 2012. The adoption of this standard did not have a significant impact on the Companys consolidatedfinancial statements.  In January 2010, the FASB issued amended standards requiring additional fair value disclosures. The amended standardsrequire disclosures of transfers in and out of Levels 1 and 2 of the fair value hierarchy, as well as requiring gross basis disclosures for purchases, sales, issuances and settlements within the Level 3 reconciliation. Additionally, the updateclarifies the requirement to determine the level of disaggregation for fair value measurement disclosures and to disclose valuation techniques and inputs used for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements in either Level 2 or Level 3.The Company adopted the new guidance in the third quarter of fiscal 2010, except for the disclosures related to purchases, sales, issuance and settlements, which was effective for the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2012. Becausethese new standards are related primarily to disclosures, their adoption has not had and is not expected to have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements.  "
