4,CTS,CTS CORP,2024-02-23,"Risk Factors
 The following are certain risk factors that could affect our business, financial condition and operating results. These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other reports filed or furnished by us, because these factors could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those projected in any such forward-looking statements. Before you invest in us, you should know that making such an investment involves risks, including the risks described below. Although the risks are organized by headings, and each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated. You should not interpret the disclosure of any risk factor to imply that the risk has not already materialized. The risks that are highlighted below are not the only ones that we face. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected. Risks Related to Our Business and Industry Because we currently derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of customers, any decrease in orders from these customers could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. We depend on a small number of customers for a substantial portion of our business, and changes in the level of our customers' orders have, in the past, had a significant impact on our results of operations. If a major customer significantly delays, reduces, or cancels the level of business it does with us, there could be an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Significant pricing and margin pressures exerted by a major customer could also materially adversely affect our operating results. In addition, we generate significant accounts receivable from sales to our major customers. If one or more of our major customers were to become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay or were to delay payment for our products, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. Our customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities or locations or delay production.  We generally receive volume estimates, but not firm volume commitments from our customers, and may experience reduced or extended lead times in customer orders. Customers may cancel orders, change production quantities and delay production for a number of reasons including the use of additional suppliers. Uncertain economic and geopolitical conditions may result in some of our customers delaying the delivery of some of the products we manufacture for them and placing purchase orders for lower volumes of products than previously anticipated. Cancellations, reductions or delays by a significant customer or by a number of customers may harm our results of operations by reducing the volumes of products we manufacture and sell, as well as by causing a delay in the recovery of our expenditures for inventory in preparation for customer orders, or by reducing our asset utilization, resulting in lower profitability. In addition, our customers may request that manufacturing of their products be transitioned from one of our facilities to another to achieve cost reductions and other objectives. Such transfers may result in short-term inefficiencies and costs due to resulting excess capacity and overhead at one facility and capacity constraints and the inability to fulfill all orders at another. In addition, we make key decisions based on our estimates of customer requirements, including determining the levels of orders that we will seek and accept, production schedules, component procurement commitments, personnel needs and other resource requirements. Changes in demand for our customers’ products may reduce our ability to estimate future customer requirements accurately. This may make it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of our manufacturing capacity. Anticipated orders may not materialize, and delivery schedules may be deferred as a result of changes in demand for our products or our customers' products. We often increase staffing and capacity and incur other expenses to meet the anticipated demand of our customers, which causes reductions in our gross margins if customer orders are delayed or canceled. On occasion, customers may require rapid increases in production, which may stress our CTS CORPORATION 9Table of Contents resources and reduce margins. We may not have sufficient capacity at any given time to meet our customers' demands. In addition, because many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed over the short-term, a reduction in customer demand could harm our gross margin and operating income until such time as adjustments can be made to activity and operating levels or to structural costs. Deterioration of general economic, political, credit and/or capital market conditions could adversely affect our financial performance, our ability to grow or sustain our business, financial condition and results of operations, and our ability to access the capital markets. We compete around the world in various geographic regions and product markets. Global economic and political conditions affect our business and the businesses of our customers and suppliers. Recessions, economic downturns, price instability, inflation, slowing economic growth and social and political instability in the markets where we compete could negatively affect our revenues and financial performance, and adversely impact our ability to grow or sustain our business. For example, current macroeconomic and political instability caused by the Russia-Ukraine conflict (as discussed below), global supply chain disruptions and inflation have adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact our business and financial results.  The capital and credit markets provide us with liquidity to operate and grow our business beyond the liquidity that operating cash flows provide. A global or regional economic downturn or disruption of the credit markets could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets necessary for our operations and to execute our strategic plan. If our access to capital on terms commercially acceptable to us were to become significantly constrained, or if costs of capital increased significantly, then our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by disruptions in the global economy caused by the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict or other geopolitical tensions and conflict. The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine (which we refer to as the “Russia-Ukraine conflict”) has adversely affected the global economy, and the geopolitical tensions and conflicts it generates may continue to negatively impact our operations. It has resulted in heightened economic sanctions from the U.S., the U.K., the European Union (the ""E.U."") and the international community. Even though we have no physical assets in Russia, the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, supply chain, availability of critical supplies, intellectual property, partners, or customers. Further escalation of geopolitical tensions related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, including increased trade barriers or restrictions on global trade, could result in, among other things, broader impacts that expand into other markets, cyberattacks, supply chain and logistics disruptions, and volatility in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and financial markets, any of which may adversely affect our business and supply chain. More broadly, there could be additional negative impacts to our financial results if the Russia-Ukraine conflict worsens, including, among other potential impacts, economic recessions in certain neighboring countries or globally due to inflationary pressures, including with respect to energy and supply chain cost increases or shortages, or the geographic proximity of the conflict relative to the rest of Europe. Similar geopolitical tensions and political and/or armed conflicts, including tensions between the U.S. and China, China and Taiwan, and the conflict between Israel and Palestine could adversely impact our employees, financial performance, and global operations, including by, among other things, jeopardizing the safety of our employees and facilities, disrupting our and our partners’ production, supply chain and logistics and communications, and causing market volatility, which could adversely impact our sales and/or amplify or affect many of our other risks described elsewhere in Part I, Item 1A, ""Risk Factors
"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The impacts of supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures could adversely impact our operating results.  Our business has been, and may continue to be, impacted by supply chain constraints, including as a result of raw materials and electronic component shortages, including, in particular, shortages of semiconductor chips and resin, longer lead times, port congestion, increased freight costs and the uncertain economic environment worldwide. These supply chain constraints have and may in the future prevent us from making scheduled shipments to customers. Our inability to make scheduled shipments could cause us to experience a shortfall in revenue, increase our costs and adversely affect our relationship with affected customers and our reputation as a reliable supplier. We may be required to pay higher prices for raw materials or electronic components in short supply and order these raw materials or electronic components in greater quantities to compensate for variable delivery times. We may also be required to pay higher prices for raw materials or electronic components due to inflationary trends regardless of supply. In addition, current proposed or future governmental policies may increase the risk of inflation, which could further increase the costs of raw materials and other components for our business. The supply and price of our key raw materials and electronic components can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including market demand, inflation, alternative sources for suppliers, global geopolitical events, global or regional disease outbreaks or pandemics, trade agreements among producing and consuming nations and governmental regulations (including tariffs).  Similarly, if the costs of goods continue to increase, our suppliers may seek price increases from us. If we are unable to mitigate the impact of these matters through price increases, cost savings to offset cost increases, hedging arrangements, or other measures, our CTS CORPORATION 10Table of Contents results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted. If our competitors maintain or substantially lower their prices, we may lose customers and mark down prices. Our profitability may be impacted by prices that do not offset the inflationary pressures, which may impact our gross margins. Even if we are able to raise the prices of our products, we may not be able to sustain such price increases. Temporary or sustained price increases may also lead to a decrease in demand for our products as competitors may not adjust their prices which could lead to a decline in sales volume and loss of market share. Our projections may not accurately predict the volume impact of price increases, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  We sell products to customers in cyclical industries that are subject to significant downturns that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. We sell products to customers in cyclical industries that have experienced economic and industry downturns. The markets for our products have softened in the past and may again soften in the future. We may face reduced end-customer demand, underutilization of our manufacturing capacity, changes in our revenue mix and other factors that could adversely affect our results.  We are susceptible to trends and factors affecting industries that we serve. Factors negatively affecting the industries we serve and the demand for their products could negatively affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Any adverse occurrence, including among others, industry slowdown, recession, public health crisis, political instability, costly or constraining regulations, increased tariffs, reduced government budgets and spending, armed hostilities, terrorism, excessive inflation, prolonged disruptions in one or more of our customers' production schedules or labor disturbances, that results in a decline in the volume of sales in these industries, or in an overall downturn in the business and operations of our customers in these industries, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. These industries may be unionized and some of our customers have experienced labor disruptions in the past. Furthermore, these industries can be highly cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, consumer preferences and interest rates. The insolvency of customers that we serve may result in the failure to receive payment in full for products sold in the past and an abrupt reduction in demand for certain products. Weakness in demand, the insolvency of customers that we serve or their suppliers, and constriction of credit markets may negatively and materially affect our facility utilization, cost structure, financial condition, and operating results. Our operating results may vary significantly from period to period. We experience fluctuations in our operating results. Some of the principal factors that contribute to these fluctuations are: changes in demand for our products; our effectiveness in managing manufacturing processes, costs and timing of our component purchases so that components are available when needed for production, while mitigating the risks of purchasing inventory in excess of immediate production needs; the degree to which we are able to utilize our available manufacturing capacity; changes in the cost and availability of components, which often occur in the electronics manufacturing industry and which affect our margins and our ability to meet delivery schedules; general economic and served industry conditions; and local conditions and events that may affect our production volumes, such as labor conditions or political instability. We may pursue acquisition opportunities that are intended to complement or expand our business as well as divestitures that could impact our business operations. We may not be able to complete these transactions, and these transactions, if executed, may pose risks that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. On an ongoing basis we explore opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that could complement, enhance or expand our current business or product lines or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities. For example, during 2022 and 2023, we acquired TEWA Temperature Sensors SP. Zo.o. (“TEWA”), Meggitt A/S (a/k/a Ferroperm Piezoceramics A/S, “Ferroperm”) and maglab AG (""Maglab""). We may have difficulty finding suitable acquisition opportunities or, if we do identify these opportunities, we may not be able to complete the transactions for any number of reasons including a failure to secure financing. In addition, we may not be able to successfully or profitably integrate, operate, maintain and manage newly acquired businesses such as TEWA, Ferroperm and Maglab, including their operations or employees. Any transactions that we are able to identify and complete may involve a number of risks, including: the diversion of management's attention from our existing business to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired or combined business; possible adverse effects on our operating results during the integration process; difficulties managing and integrating operations in geographically dispersed locations; increases in our expenses and working capital requirements, which could reduce our return on invested capital; exposure to unanticipated liabilities of acquired companies; and our possible inability to achieve the intended objectives of the transaction. Even if we are initially successful in integrating a new operation, we may not be able to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, and this may lead to operational inefficiencies. In addition, future acquisitions may result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of additional debt. These and other factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability from acquired operations or realize other anticipated benefits of an acquisition and could adversely affect our business and operating results. CTS CORPORATION 11Table of Contents We have in the past, and may in the future, consider divesting certain business operations. Divestitures may involve a number of risks, including the diversion of management's attention, significant costs and expenses, the loss of customer relationships and cash flow, and the disruption of operations in the affected business. Failure to timely complete or consummate a divestiture may negatively affect valuation of the affected business or result in restructuring charges. We may restructure our operations or fail to execute capital projects as planned, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. We have announced and initiated restructuring plans or capital projects at various times in the recent past designed to revise and consolidate certain aspects of our operations for the purpose of improving our cost structure and operational efficiency. We may incur restructuring and impairment charges in the future if circumstances warrant, which could be material. Additionally, if we are unsuccessful in implementing restructuring plans or in executing capital projects, we may experience disruptions in our operations and higher ongoing costs, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. We may be unable to compete effectively against competitors. The industries in which we operate are highly competitive and characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change. We compete against many domestic and foreign companies, some of which have substantially greater manufacturing, financial, research and development, and marketing resources than we do. If any customer becomes dissatisfied with our prices, quality, or timeliness of delivery, among other things, it could award business to our competitors. Moreover, some of our customers could choose to manufacture and develop particular products themselves rather than purchase them from us. Increased competition could result in price reductions, reduced profit margins and loss of market share, each of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. These developments also may materially adversely affect our ability to compete successfully going forward. We cannot assure you that our products will continue to compete successfully with our competitors' products. We may be unable to keep pace with rapid technological changes that could make some of our products or processes obsolete before we realize a return on our investment. The technologies relating to some of our products have undergone and are continuing to undergo changes. End markets for our products are characterized by technological change, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, changes in customer requirements, and emerging industry standards. The introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable before we can recover any or all of our research, development and commercialization expenses, or our capital investments. Furthermore, the life cycles of our products and the products we manufacture for others vary, may change, and are difficult to estimate. We may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of new products or product enhancements and our new products or product enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance. If we are unable, for technological or other reasons, to develop and market new products or product enhancements in a timely and cost-effective manner, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. Products we manufacture may contain design or manufacturing defects that could result in reduced demand for our products or services and liability claims against us. Despite our quality control and quality assurance efforts, defects may occur in the products we manufacture due to design or manufacturing errors, supplier quality issues, or component failure. Product defects could result in delayed shipments and reduced demand for our products. We may be subject to increased costs due to warranty claims on defective products. Product defects could result in product liability claims against us where defects cause, or are alleged to cause, property damage, bodily injury or death. As we grow our business, the risk of exposure to product liability litigation increases. We may be required to participate in a recall involving products which are, or are alleged to be, defective. We carry insurance for certain legal matters involving product liability; however, costs related to product defects and the costs of such claims, including costs of defense and settlement, may exceed our available coverage. Accordingly, our results of operations, cash flow and financial position could be adversely affected. We are subject to government regulations, including environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, that expose us to potential financial liability. Our operations are regulated by a number of federal, state, local and foreign government regulations, including those pertaining to environmental, health, and safety (“EHS”) that govern, among other things, air and water emissions, worker protection, and the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials. Compliance with EHS laws and regulations is a major consideration for us because we use CTS CORPORATION 12Table of Contents hazardous materials in our manufacturing processes. If we violate EHS laws and regulations, we could be liable for substantial fines, penalties, and costs of mandated remedial actions and we could suffer reputational damage due to any such violations. Our environmental permits could also be revoked or modified, which could require us to cease or limit production at one or more of our facilities, thereby materially adversely affecting our business, financial condition and operating results. EHS laws and regulations have generally become more stringent over time and could continue to do so, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with any violation, which also could materially affect our business, financial condition and operating results. We have been notified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), state environmental agencies and, in some cases, groups of potentially responsible parties, that we are potentially liable for environmental contamination at several sites currently and formerly owned or operated by us, including sites designated as National Priorities List sites under the EPA’s Superfund program. Superfund liability is joint and several and we may be held responsible for more than our share of contamination at a site. On February 8, 2023, we received a demand letter from the EPA seeking reimbursement of its past response costs and interest thereon in the amount of $9,955 relating to the CTS of Asheville, Inc. Superfund Site, from the three potentially responsible parties associated with the site, including the Company. See Note 11 ""Contingencies"" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Although we estimate our potential environmental liability and reserve for such matters, including the Asheville site, we cannot assure you that our reserves will be sufficient to cover the actual costs that we incur as a result of these matters.  Future events, such as the notification of potential liability at new sites, the discovery of additional contamination or changes to an approved remedy at an existing site, changes to existing EHS laws and regulations or their interpretation, and more rigorous regulatory action by government authorities, may require additional expenditures by us, which could have a negative impact on our operations. Changes in tax, environmental, trade or other regulations or failure to comply with existing licensing, trade and other regulations could cause volatility or have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.  Future changes to U.S. or foreign tax and trade policies, impositions of new or increased tariffs, other trade restrictions or other government actions, including any government shutdown, may lead to the continuation or escalation of such risks and uncertainty.  In addition, changes to existing tax laws or the adoption of new tax laws, particularly in the U.S. and the E.U., could have a material adverse impact on our effective tax rate, future cash tax liabilities and the ability to utilize deferred tax assets. The current economic and political environment may result in significant tax law changes in the numerous jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, our effective tax rate could be materially affected by certain tax proposals developed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and European Commission regarding the taxation of multinational businesses. Adverse changes in the underlying profitability and financial outlook of our operations in several jurisdictions could lead to changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and other tax accruals that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, acquisitions or divestitures may cause our effective tax rate to change. We base our tax positions upon the anticipated nature and conduct of our business and upon our understanding of the tax laws of the various countries in which we have assets or conduct activities. However, our tax positions are subject to review and possible challenge by taxing authorities and to possible changes in law, which may have a retroactive effect. Continued economic and political pressures to increase tax revenues in jurisdictions in which we operate, or the adoption of new or reformed tax legislation or regulation, may make resolving tax disputes more difficult. The final resolution of tax audits and any related litigation can differ from our historical provisions and accruals, resulting in an adverse effect on our financial performance. Additionally, modifications of laws and policies governing foreign trade and investment, including trade agreements and tariffs such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or the European Union-United Kingdom Trade and Cooperating Agreement, could adversely affect our supply chain, business and results of operations. The implementation of additional tariffs and retaliatory tariffs from trade partners or related uncertainties could further increase the cost of certain of our imported materials, thereby adversely affecting our profitability. Failure to comply with existing laws and regulations or changes in these laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof, specifically tax and environmental laws or any other laws or regulations could result in the loss, revocation or suspension of our licenses, permits or approvals and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of, and potential future developments in, complex domestic and international tax laws and regulations, the amount and timing of future taxable income and the interaction of such laws and regulations among jurisdictions. Given the wide range of international business relationships and the long-term nature and complexity of existing contractual agreements, differences arising between the actual results and assumptions made, or future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments to tax income and expense already recorded. Risks Related to Technology and Data Privacy  CTS CORPORATION 13Table of Contents We are exposed to, and may be adversely affected by, cybersecurity threats, incidents or other disruptions to our information technology systems and data. We rely on our information technology systems and networks, including cloud-based systems, in connection with many of our business activities, some of which are managed directly by us, while others are managed by third-party service providers and are not under our direct control. Our operations routinely involve receiving, storing, processing and transmitting information pertaining to our business, customers, suppliers, employees, and other operations. We have both an increasing reliance on information technology systems and an increasing digital footprint as a result of changing technologies, connected devices and digital offerings, as well as expanded remote work policies. If these technologies, systems, products or services are threatened, disputed, damaged, cease to function properly, are compromised due to employee or third-party contractor error, user error, malfeasance, system errors, or other vulnerabilities, or are subject to cybersecurity incidents, such as those involving denial of service attacks, ransomware, unauthorized access, malicious software, or other intrusions or disruptions, including by criminals, nation states or insiders, our business may be adversely impacted. The impacts of any such circumstances could include production downtimes, operational delays, and other impacts on our operations and ability to provide products and services to our customers; compromise of confidential, proprietary or otherwise protected information, including personal information and customer confidential data; destruction, corruption, or theft of data or intellectual property; manipulation, disruption, or improper use of these technologies, systems, products or services; financial losses from fraudulent transactions, remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability; adverse media coverage; and legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations, actions and fines; and damage to our reputation and, as a result, have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial performance. Cybersecurity incidents could have a disruptive effect on our business. From time to time, we and the service providers that we depend on to host our data and support our systems and business operations, are the target of, and periodically respond to, cybersecurity threats, including phishing and denial-of-service attacks, which, if successful, could result in a loss of business or customer information, systems interruption or the disruption of our operations.  The techniques that are used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems and data change frequently, have continued to increase in recent years and such efforts may be difficult to detect for long periods of time.   As a result, we monitor our systems to protect our technology infrastructure and data. In addition, we further attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of other measures, including employee training, a breach response plan, and maintenance of backup and protective systems. Further, while we maintain insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of cybersecurity risks, such insurance coverage may not cover all losses or all types of claims that arise. Notwithstanding these measures, our systems, networks, products and services remain potentially vulnerable to known or unknown cybersecurity threats, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial performance.  We have in the past been subject to cybersecurity incidents which have not had a material impact on our business or financial condition and expect that we will be subject to additional cybersecurity incidents in the future. We are exposed to risks and costs associated with complying with privacy laws and protecting personal data and other sensitive information.	 We are subject to various risks and costs associated with the collection, handling, storage and transmission of information, including costs related to compliance with U.S. and foreign data protection and privacy laws and other contractual obligations, as well as risks associated with the compromise of our systems collecting such information.  Many jurisdictions, including the E.U., the U.K., China and certain states within the U.S., have passed laws that require companies to meet specific requirements regarding the processing, use, and disclosure of personal data.  We collect internal and customer data and other information, including personally identifiable information for a variety of business purposes, including managing our workforce and providing requested products and services.  We could be exposed to investigations, fines, penalties, restrictions, litigation, reputational harm or other expenses, or other adverse effects on our business, due to failure to protect personal data or other sensitive information or failure to maintain compliance with the various U.S. and foreign data collection and privacy laws or applicable data security standards.   Failure to keep pace with developments in technology could adversely affect our operations or competitive position. The technologies and systems we use to operate our business may require refinements and upgrades, and third parties may cease support of systems that are currently in use.  The development and maintenance of these technologies may require significant investment by us.  As various systems and technologies become outdated or new technology is required, we may not be able to replace or introduce them as quickly as needed or in a cost-effective and timely manner.  As a result, our business operations could be disrupted and we could be exposed to cybersecurity threats, adversely affecting our business operations and financial performance. Because third parties provide us with a number of operational and technical services, third-party cybersecurity incidents could expose us to liability, harm our reputation, damage our competitiveness and adversely affect our financial performance.  CTS CORPORATION 14Table of Contents Third parties provide us with certain operational and technical services. These third parties may have access to our systems, provide hosting services, or otherwise process data about or on behalf of us, our employees or partners.  Any third-party cybersecurity incident could compromise the security, integrity or availability of or result in the theft, unauthorized access or processing, or disruption of access to data, which could negatively impact our operations.  We rely on the internal processes and controls of third-party software and application vendors to maintain the security of all software code, systems, and data provided to or used by or on behalf of the Company.  Any cybersecurity incidents involving third parties on which we rely could negatively affect our reputation, our competitive position and our financial performance, and we could face regulatory scrutiny, investigations, lawsuits and further potential liability.  Risks Related to Indebtedness and Financing Our indebtedness may adversely affect our financial health. Our indebtedness could, among other things: increase our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions, including recessions; require us to use cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and other expenses; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness; or limit our ability to borrow additional funds that may be needed to operate and expand our business.  Our credit facility contains provisions that could materially restrict our business. Our revolving credit facility contains restrictions limiting our ability to: dispose of assets; incur certain additional debt; repay other debt or amend subordinated debt instruments; create liens on assets; make investments, loans or advances; make acquisitions or engage in mergers or consolidations; engage in certain transactions with our subsidiaries and affiliates; repurchase stock; or make dividend payments above a certain amount. The restrictions contained in our credit facility could limit our ability to plan for or react to changes in market conditions or meet capital needs or could otherwise restrict our activities or business plans. These restrictions could adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, make strategic acquisitions, fund investments or other capital needs or engage in other business activities that could be in our interest. Further, our ability to comply with our loan covenants may be affected by events beyond our control that could result in an event of default under our credit facility, or documents governing any other existing or future indebtedness. A default, if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of our indebtedness. In addition, our lenders could terminate their commitments to make further extensions of credit under our credit facility. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds to pay the accelerated indebtedness or that we will have the ability to refinance accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us, or at all. The estimates and assumptions on which our financial projections are based may prove to be inaccurate, which may cause our actual results to materially differ from such projections, which may adversely affect our future profitability, cash flows and stock price.   Our financial projections, including any sales or earnings guidance or outlook we may provide from time to time, are dependent on certain estimates and assumptions related to, among other things, development and launch of innovative new products, market share projections, product pricing, sales, volume and product mix, foreign exchange rates and volatility, tax rates, interest rates, commodity prices, cost savings, accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves, and our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to reinvest in our existing business, fund internal growth, repurchase our stock, make acquisitions, pay dividends and meet debt obligations. There is no assurance that we will fully realize the anticipated cost savings and other benefits of our restructuring activities in the time frames we desire or at all. Our financial projections are based on historical experience and on various other estimates and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made, and our actual results may differ materially from our financial projections. Any material variation between our financial projections and our actual results may adversely affect our future profitability, cash flows and stock price. Risks Related to Other External Factors  Loss, operational disruptions or closure of a key facility, including those of our suppliers, due to unforeseen or catastrophic events or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.  Our business could be interrupted and our financial results could be materially adversely impacted by physical risks such as earthquakes, fires, hurricanes, floods, acts of war, terrorist attacks, cyberattacks and other disruptions in information systems, disease outbreaks or CTS CORPORATION 15Table of Contents pandemics, and other natural disasters or catastrophic events that damage, disrupt or destroy one of our key facilities or the key facilities of our significant suppliers. If any of our key facilities or the key facilities of our significant suppliers experience a significant operational disruption or catastrophic loss, it could delay, disrupt or reduce production, shipments and revenue, and result in potentially significant expenses to repair or replace these properties. Such significant disruptions could be due to, among other things:•the loss or disruption of the timely availability of adequate supplies of essential raw materials for us and our suppliers, including single-source suppliers; •our ability to integrate new suppliers into our operations;•material financial issues facing our suppliers, such as bankruptcy or similar proceedings; •transportation and logistics challenges, including as a result of port and border closures and other governmental restrictions and the availability and capacity of shipping channels; •the loss or disruption of other manufacturing, distribution and supply capabilities; •the loss or disruption of the energy sources or energy suppliers in Europe due to supply shortages as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, including price increases in the energy market; •labor shortages, strikes or work stoppages; •illness to our employees or their families or governmental restrictions on such employees' ability to travel or perform necessary business functions; or •as a result of the need for us or our suppliers to operate our respective businesses with substantial modifications to employee travel and employee work locations.  Additionally, certain catastrophes are not covered by our general insurance policies, which could result in significant unrecoverable losses. Our business and results of operations could also be adversely impacted by under-investment in physical assets or production capacity. Climate-related events and climate change legislation could adversely impact our business. The effects of climate change and the ongoing efforts to mitigate its impact, including through climate change-related legislation and regulation, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  The physical effects of climate change, including extreme weather and natural disasters (including those risks discussed under the heading “Loss, operational disruptions or closure of a key facility, including those of our suppliers, due to unforeseen or catastrophic events or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results”) may disrupt our operations and those of our customers and suppliers.  In addition, changes to laws or regulations enacted to address the potential impacts of climate change could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  For example, continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national, regional, or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Any future increased regulation concerning greenhouse gas emissions and other climate-change related laws and regulations, may require equipment modifications, operational changes, payment of increased or additional taxes, or the purchase of emission credits to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases from our operations, which may result in us incurring substantial capital expenditures and compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs. In addition, any such future regulatory changes could result in transition risks to our business, including but not limited to (i) the nature and timing of any requirement to lower greenhouse gas emissions and adopt more energy-efficient energy use, which could result in changes or disruptions to the way we operate our business, (ii) the risk of lower demand for our products related to customers who experience business declines or disruptions due to the impact of any requirement to lower greenhouse gas emissions, (iii) financial risks where compliance with such regulations requires unforeseen capital expenditures, (iv) legal risks associated with the implementation of any new technologies required to comply with such regulations, which could impede our ability to innovate new products, meet customer and market demand or compete on pricing and quality in the market, and/or (v) reputational risks associated with our customers’ and investors’ perceptions of our business. We are not able to predict how any future definitive agreements, pacts and/or regulations, if and when they are adopted and required, and the commitments necessary to comply with such requirements, will affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. General Risk Factors
 Unfavorable outcomes of legal or regulatory matters may adversely affect our business and financial condition and damage our reputation.  CTS CORPORATION 16Table of Contents We are from time to time involved in or subject to a variety of litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings or matters related to our business, warranty claims, our intellectual property rights, alleged infringement or misappropriation by us of intellectual property rights of others, tax, environmental, privacy, insurance, ERISA and employment matters. Such matters, even those that are ultimately non-meritorious, can be complex, costly, and highly disruptive to business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and other key personnel, and may generate adverse publicity that damages our reputation. The assessment of the outcome of such matters, including our potential liability, if any, is a highly subjective process that requires judgments about future events that are not within our control and are based on the information available to management at that time. The outcome of such matters, including amounts ultimately received or paid upon judgment or settlement, may differ materially from management’s outlook or estimates, including any amounts accrued in the financial statements. Actual outcomes, including judgments, awards, settlements or orders, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, or cash flows and damage our reputation.  We face risks relating to our international operations. Because we have significant international operations, our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by economic, political, health, regulatory and other factors existing in foreign countries in which we operate. Our international operations are subject to inherent risks, which may materially adversely affect us, including: political and economic instability in countries in which our products are manufactured; expropriation or the imposition of government controls; changes in government regulations; export license requirements; trade restrictions; earnings repatriation and expatriation restrictions; exposure to different legal standards, including related to intellectual property; health conditions and standards; currency controls; fluctuations in exchange rates; increases in the duties and taxes we pay; inflation or deflation; greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer payment cycles; changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing our international operations; limitations on insurance coverage against geopolitical risks, natural disasters, and business operations; and communication among and with management of international operations. In addition, these same factors may also place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to some of our foreign competitors. We may face risks associated with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws (collectively, ""Anti-Bribery Laws""). Anti-Bribery Laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our Code of Ethics mandates compliance with these Anti-Bribery Laws. We operate in many parts of the world where strict compliance with Anti-Bribery Laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We cannot assure you that our internal controls and procedures always will protect us from the detrimental actions by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for violations of Anti-Bribery Laws (either due to our own acts or inadvertence or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Public health or safety concerns and governmental restrictions that impact the availability of raw materials, labor, or the movement of goods in some of the countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results. We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. We transact business in various foreign countries. We present our consolidated financial statements in U.S. dollars, but a portion of our revenues and expenditures are transacted in other currencies. As a result, we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies. Additionally, we have currency exposure arising from funds held in local currencies in foreign countries. Volatility in the exchange rates between the foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Furthermore, to the extent we sell our products in foreign markets, currency fluctuations may result in our products becoming too expensive for foreign customers. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property or we infringe or are alleged to infringe, on others' intellectual property rights, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The success of our business depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights and patents, obtain or license patents and operate without infringing on the intellectual property rights of others. We rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, patents, nondisclosure agreements and technical and other measures to protect our proprietary rights in our products and technology. The steps we have taken to prevent misappropriation of our technology may be inadequate. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which we operate do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Although we continue to evaluate and implement protective measures, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful. Our inability to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish or eliminate the competitive advantages that we derive from our technology, cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business. CTS CORPORATION 17Table of Contents We believe that patents will continue to play an important role in our business. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in securing patents for claims in any pending patent application or that any issued patent will provide us with any competitive advantage. We also cannot provide assurance that the patents will not be challenged by third parties or that the patents of others will not materially adversely affect our ability to do business. We may become involved in litigation in the future to protect our intellectual property or because others may allege that we infringed on their intellectual property. These claims and any resulting lawsuit could subject us to liability for damages and invalidate our intellectual property rights. If an infringement claim is successfully asserted by a holder of intellectual property rights, we may be required to cease marketing or selling certain products, pay penalties and spend significant time and money to develop a non-infringing product or process or to obtain licenses for the technology, process or information from the holder. We may not be successful in the development of a non-infringing alternative, or licenses may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, in which case we may lose sales and profits. In addition, any litigation could be lengthy and costly and could materially adversely affect us even if we are successful in the litigation. Loss of our key management and other personnel, or an inability to attract key management and other personnel, could materially affect our business. We depend on our senior executive officers and other key personnel to run our business. We do not have long-term employment contracts with our key personnel. The loss of any of these officers or other key personnel could adversely affect our operations. Our future success depends on our ability to identify, attract, and retain qualified personnel on a timely basis. If we were to experience turnover of senior management or if a member of our senior management were to become ill or incapacitated, our stock price, our results of operations, our commercial and supply chain operations and our vendor or customer relationships could each be adversely impacted, and such events may make recruiting for future management positions more difficult. The labor market for many of our employees is very competitive, and wages and compensation costs continue to increase. Our ability to attract and retain key talent has been, and may continue to be, impacted by challenges in the labor market, particularly in the U.S., which has recently been experiencing wage inflation, labor shortages, and the impacts of remote work. If we face labor shortages and/or increased labor costs as a result of increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover rates, or increases in employee benefits costs, our operating expenses could increase, which could negatively impact our growth and results of operations. Labor shortages, and higher employee turnover rates could also lead to disruptions in our business. In addition, we must successfully integrate any new management personnel that we hire within our organization, or who join our organization as a result of an acquisition, in order to achieve our operating objectives, and changes in other key management positions may temporarily affect our financial performance and results of operations as new management becomes familiar with our business. Ineffective internal control over our financial reporting may harm our business. We are subject to the ongoing internal control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (""Sarbanes-Oxley""). Our controls necessary for continued compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley may not operate effectively or at all times and may result in a material weakness. The identification of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting could indicate a lack of proper controls to generate accurate financial statements. Further, the effectiveness of our internal controls may be impacted if we are unable to retain sufficient skilled finance and accounting personnel, especially in light of the increased demand for such personnel among publicly traded companies. Environmental, social, and governance (""ESG"") issues, including those related to climate change and sustainability, may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and damage our reputation.   Companies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny relating to their ESG practices and policies. Increased focus and activism related to ESG may hinder our access to capital or negatively impact our stock price, as investors may reconsider their capital investment based on their assessment of our ESG practices and policies. In particular, investor advocacy groups, institutional investors, stockholders, employees, consumers, customers, regulators, proxy advisory services and other market participants have increasingly focused on ESG practices and policies of companies, including sustainability performance and risk mitigation efforts, and their effect on companies from an investor, consumer, customer or employee perspective. If our ESG practices do not meet investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards or evolving regulatory requirements, our stock price, sales, ability to access capital markets, reputation and employee retention, among other things, may be negatively affected. Shareholder activism efforts or unsolicited offers from a third-party could cause a material disruption to our business and financial results. We may be subject to various legal and business challenges due to actions instituted by shareholder activists or an unsolicited third-party offer. Perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of shareholder activism may lead to the perception of a change CTS CORPORATION 18Table of Contents in the direction of the business or other instability and may affect our relationships with vendors, customers, prospective and current employees and others. Proposed or future laws and regulations may increase the chance we become the target of shareholder activist campaigns, including ESG-related actions. If shareholder activist campaigns are initiated against us, our response to such actions could be costly and time-consuming, which could divert the attention and resources of our Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer and senior management from the pursuit of our business strategies, which could harm our business, negatively impact our stock price, and have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. Future dividends on our common stock may be restricted or eliminated. Dividends are declared at the discretion of our Board of Directors, and future dividends will depend on our future earnings, cash flow, financial requirements and other factors. Under the most restrictive terms of our credit agreements, our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock is limited, as described under “Risks Related to Indebtedness and Financing.” There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends in the future. We may not continue to repurchase our common stock or make repurchases our common stock at favorable prices. In February 2024, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program that authorizes the Company to repurchase up to $100 million of its common stock. Any purchases will depend on a number of factors, including our evaluation of general market and economic conditions, our financial condition and the trading price of our common stock. The repurchase program may be extended, modified, suspended or discontinued at any time. A reduction in, or the completion of, our repurchase program could have a negative effect on our stock price. We can provide no assurance that we will repurchase our common stock at favorable prices, or at all.On August 16, 2022, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“Inflation Reduction Act”) was enacted. The Inflation Reduction Act imposes on publicly-traded companies a new, nondeductible excise tax equal to 1% of the fair market value of any stock of a company that is repurchased after December 31, 2022, during its taxable year. Because this excise tax would be payable by us, and not by a redeeming holder, the imposition of this excise tax could cause a reduction in the cash available on hand to implement the repurchase program"
3,CTS,CTS CORP,2023-02-24,"Risk Factors
 The following are certain risk factors that could affect our business, financial condition and operating results. These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other reports filed or furnished by us, because these factors could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those projected in any such forward-looking statements. Before you invest in us, you should know that making such an investment involves risks, including the risks described below. Although the risks are organized by headings, and each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated. You should not interpret the disclosure of any risk factor to imply that the risk has not already materialized. The risks that are highlighted below are not the only ones that we face. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected. Risks Related to Our Business and Industry Because we currently derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of customers, any decrease in orders from these customers could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. We depend on a small number of customers for a substantial portion of our business, and changes in the level of our customers' orders have, in the past, had a significant impact on our results of operations. If a major customer significantly delays, reduces, or cancels the level of business it does with us, there could be an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Significant pricing and margin pressures exerted by a major customer could also materially adversely affect our operating results. In addition, we generate significant accounts receivable from sales to our major customers. If one or more of our major customers were to become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay or were to delay payment for our products, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. Our customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities or locations or delay production. We generally receive volume estimates, but not firm volume commitments from our customers, and may experience reduced or extended lead times in customer orders. Customers may cancel orders, change production quantities and delay production for a number of reasons. Uncertain economic and geopolitical conditions may result in some of our customers delaying the delivery of some of the products we manufacture for them and placing purchase orders for lower volumes of products than previously anticipated. Cancellations, reductions or delays by a significant customer or by a number of customers may harm our results of operations by reducing the volumes of products we manufacture and sell, as well as by causing a delay in the recovery of our expenditures for inventory in preparation for customer orders, or by reducing our asset utilization, resulting in lower profitability. In addition, our customers may request that manufacturing of their products be transitioned from one of our facilities to another to achieve cost reductions and other objectives. Such transfers may result in short term inefficiencies and costs due to resulting excess CTS CORPORATION 9Table of Contents capacity and overhead at one facility and capacity constraints and the inability to fulfill all orders at another. In addition, we make key decisions based on our estimates of customer requirements, including determining the levels of orders that we will seek and accept, production schedules, component procurement commitments, personnel needs and other resource requirements. Changes in demand for our customers’ products may reduce our ability to estimate future customer requirements accurately. This may make it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of our manufacturing capacity. Anticipated orders may not materialize, and delivery schedules may be deferred as a result of changes in demand for our products or our customers' products. We often increase staffing and capacity and incur other expenses to meet the anticipated demand of our customers, which causes reductions in our gross margins if customer orders are delayed or canceled. On occasion, customers may require rapid increases in production, which may stress our resources and reduce margins. We may not have sufficient capacity at any given time to meet our customers' demands. In addition, because many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed over the short-term, a reduction in customer demand could harm our gross margin and operating income until such time as adjustments can be made to activity and operating levels or to structural costs. Deterioration of general economic, political, credit and/or capital market conditions could adversely affect our financial performance, our ability to grow or sustain our business, financial condition and results of operations, and our ability to access the capital markets. We compete around the world in various geographic regions and product markets. Global economic and political conditions affect our business and the businesses of our customers, suppliers and consumers. Recessions, economic downturns, price instability, inflation, slowing economic growth and social and political instability in the markets where we compete could negatively affect our revenues and financial performance, and adversely impact our ability to grow or sustain our business. For example, current macroeconomic and political instability caused by the Russia-Ukraine conflict (as discussed below), global supply chain disruptions and inflation have adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact our business and financial results.  The capital and credit markets provide us with liquidity to operate and grow our business beyond the liquidity that operating cash flows provide. A global or regional economic downturn or disruption of the credit markets could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets necessary for our operations and to execute our strategic plan. If our access to capital on terms commercially acceptable to us were to become significantly constrained, or if costs of capital increased significantly, then our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. Our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by disruptions in the global economy caused by the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict or other geopolitical tensions and conflict. The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine (which we refer to as the “Russia-Ukraine conflict”), has adversely affected the global economy, and the geopolitical tensions and conflicts it generates may continue to negatively impact our operations. It has resulted in heightened economic sanctions from the U.S., the U.K., the European Union and the international community. Even though we have no physical assets in Russia, the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, supply chain, availability of critical supplies, intellectual property, partners, or customers. Further escalation of geopolitical tensions related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, including increased trade barriers or restrictions on global trade, could result in, among other things, broader impacts that expand into other markets, cyberattacks, supply chain and logistics disruptions, and volatility in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and financial markets, any of which may adversely affect our business and supply chain. More broadly, there could be additional negative impacts to our financial results if the Russia-Ukraine conflict worsens, including, among other potential impacts, economic recessions in certain neighboring countries or globally due to inflationary pressures, including with respect to energy and supply chain cost increases or shortages, or the geographic proximity of the conflict relative to the rest of Europe. Similar geopolitical tensions and political conflicts, including tensions between the U.S. and China as well as between China and Taiwan, could adversely impact our employees, financial performance, and global operations, including by, among other things, jeopardizing the safety of our employees and facilities, disrupting our and our partners’ production, supply chain and logistics and communications, and causing market volatility, which could adversely impact our sales. In addition, the effects of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict as well as escalating tensions between China and Taiwan and other geopolitical conflicts could amplify or affect many of our other risks described elsewhere in Part I, Item 1A, ""Risk Factors
"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The impacts of supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures could adversely impact our operating results.  Our business has been, and may continue to be, impacted by supply chain constraints, including as a result of raw materials and electronic component shortages, including, in particular, shortages of semiconductor chips and resin, longer lead times, port congestion, increased freight costs and the uncertain economic environment worldwide. These supply chain constraints have and may in the future prevent us from making scheduled shipments to customers. Our inability to make scheduled shipments could cause us to experience a shortfall in revenue, increase our costs and adversely affect our relationship with affected customers and our reputation as a reliable supplier. We may be required to pay higher prices for raw materials or electronic components in short supply and order these raw materials or electronic components in greater quantities to compensate for variable delivery times. We may also be required to pay higher prices for CTS CORPORATION 10Table of Contents raw materials or electronic components due to inflationary trends regardless of supply, including the current high inflationary environment. In addition, current proposed or future governmental policies may increase the risk of inflation, which could further increase the costs of raw materials and other components for our business. The supply and price of our key raw materials and electronic components can be affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including market demand, inflation, alternative sources for suppliers, global geopolitical events, global or regional disease outbreaks or pandemics, trade agreements among producing and consuming nations and governmental regulations (including tariffs).  Similarly, if the costs of goods continue to increase, our suppliers may seek price increases from us. If we are unable to mitigate the impact of these matters through price increases, cost savings to offset cost increases, hedging arrangements, or other measures, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted. If our competitors maintain or substantially lower their prices, we may lose customers and mark down prices. Our profitability may be impacted by prices that do not offset the inflationary pressures, which may impact our gross margins. Even if we are able to raise the prices of our products, we may not be able to sustain such price increases. Temporary or sustained price increases may also lead to a decrease in demand for our products as competitors may not adjust their prices which could lead to a decline in sales volume and loss of market share. Our projections may not accurately predict the volume impact of price increases, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.  We sell products to customers in cyclical industries that are subject to significant downturns that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.  We sell products to customers in cyclical industries that have experienced economic and industry downturns. The markets for our products have softened in the past and may again soften in the future. We may face reduced end-customer demand, underutilization of our manufacturing capacity, changes in our revenue mix and other factors that could adversely affect our results.   We are susceptible to trends and factors affecting industries that we serve.  Factors negatively affecting the industries we serve and the demand for their products could negatively affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Any adverse occurrence, including among others, industry slowdown, recession, public health crisis, political instability, costly or constraining regulations, increased tariffs, reduced government budgets and spending, armed hostilities, terrorism, excessive inflation, including the current high inflationary environment, prolonged disruptions in one or more of our customers' production schedules or labor disturbances, that results in a decline in the volume of sales in these industries, or in an overall downturn in the business and operations of our customers in these industries, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. These industries may be unionized and some of our customers have experienced labor disruptions in the past. Furthermore, these industries can be highly cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, consumer preferences and interest rates. The insolvency of customers that we serve may result in the failure to receive payment in full for products sold in the past and an abrupt reduction in demand for certain products. Weakness in demand, the insolvency of customers that we serve or their suppliers, and constriction of credit markets may negatively and materially affect our facility utilization, cost structure, financial condition, and operating results.  Our operating results may vary significantly from period to period.  We experience fluctuations in our operating results. Some of the principal factors that contribute to these fluctuations are: changes in demand for our products; our effectiveness in managing manufacturing processes, costs and timing of our component purchases so that components are available when needed for production, while mitigating the risks of purchasing inventory in excess of immediate production needs; the degree to which we are able to utilize our available manufacturing capacity; changes in the cost and availability of components, which often occur in the electronics manufacturing industry and which affect our margins and our ability to meet delivery schedules; general economic and served industry conditions; and local conditions and events that may affect our production volumes, such as labor conditions or political instability.  We may pursue acquisition opportunities that complement or expand our business as well as divestitures that could impact our business operations. We may not be able to complete these transactions, and these transactions, if executed, may pose risks that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.  On an ongoing basis we explore opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that could complement, enhance or expand our current business or product lines or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities. For example, during 2022, we acquired both TEWA Temperature Sensors SP. Zo.o. (“TEWA”) and Meggitt A/S (a/k/a Ferroperm Piezoceramics A/S, “Ferroperm”). We may have difficulty finding suitable opportunities or, if we do identify these opportunities, we may not be able to complete the transactions for any number of reasons including a failure to secure financing. In addition, we may not be able to successfully or profitably integrate, operate, maintain and manage newly acquired businesses such as TEWA and Ferroperm, including their operations or employees. Any transactions that we are able to identify and complete may involve a number of risks, including: the diversion of management's attention CTS CORPORATION 11Table of Contents from our existing business to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired or combined business; possible adverse effects on our operating results during the integration process; difficulties managing and integrating operations in geographically dispersed locations; increases in our expenses and working capital requirements, which could reduce our return on invested capital; exposure to unanticipated liabilities of acquired companies; and our possible inability to achieve the intended objectives of the transaction. Even if we are initially successful in integrating a new operation, we may not be able to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, and this may lead to operational inefficiencies. In addition, future acquisitions may result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of additional debt. These and other factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability from acquired operations or realize other anticipated benefits of an acquisition and could adversely affect our business and operating results.  We have in the past, and may in the future, consider divesting certain business operations. Divestitures may involve a number of risks, including the diversion of management's attention, significant costs and expenses, the loss of customer relationships and cash flow, and the disruption of operations in the affected business. Failure to timely complete or consummate a divestiture may negatively affect valuation of the affected business or result in restructuring charges.  We may restructure our operations or fail to execute capital projects as planned, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.  We have announced and initiated restructuring plans or capital projects at various times in the recent past designed to revise and consolidate certain aspects of our operations for the purpose of improving our cost structure and operational efficiency. We may incur restructuring and impairment charges in the future if circumstances warrant, which could be material. Additionally, if we are unsuccessful in implementing restructuring plans or in executing capital projects, we may experience disruptions in our operations and higher ongoing costs, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.  We may be unable to compete effectively against competitors.  The industries in which we operate are highly competitive and characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change. We compete against many domestic and foreign companies, some of which have substantially greater manufacturing, financial, research and development, and marketing resources than we do. If any customer becomes dissatisfied with our prices, quality, or timeliness of delivery, among other things, it could award business to our competitors. Moreover, some of our customers could choose to manufacture and develop particular products themselves rather than purchase them from us. Increased competition could result in price reductions, reduced profit margins and loss of market share, each of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. These developments also may materially adversely affect our ability to compete successfully going forward. We cannot assure you that our products will continue to compete successfully with our competitors' products.  We may be unable to keep pace with rapid technological changes that could make some of our products or processes obsolete before we realize a return on our investment.  The technologies relating to some of our products have undergone and are continuing to undergo changes. End markets for our products are characterized by technological change, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, changes in customer requirements, and emerging industry standards. The introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable before we can recover any or all of our research, development and commercialization expenses, or our capital investments. Furthermore, the life cycles of our products and the products we manufacture for others vary, may change, and are difficult to estimate.  We may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of new products or product enhancements and our new products or product enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance. If we are unable, for technological or other reasons, to develop and market new products or product enhancements in a timely and cost-effective manner, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.  Products we manufacture may contain design or manufacturing defects that could result in reduced demand for our products or services and liability claims against us.  Despite our quality control and quality assurance efforts, defects may occur in the products we manufacture due to design or manufacturing errors, supplier quality issues, or component failure. Product defects could result in delayed shipments and reduced demand for our products. We may be subject to increased costs due to warranty claims on defective products. Product defects could result in product liability claims against us where defects cause, or are alleged to cause, property damage, bodily injury or death. As we grow our business, the risk of exposure to product liability litigation increases. We may be required to participate in a recall involving CTS CORPORATION 12Table of Contents products which are, or are alleged to be, defective. We carry insurance for certain legal matters involving product liability; however, costs related to product defects and the costs of such claims, including costs of defense and settlement, may exceed our available coverage. Accordingly, our results of operations, cash flow and financial position could be adversely affected.  We are subject to government regulations, including environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, that expose us to potential financial liability.  Our operations are regulated by a number of federal, state, local and foreign government regulations, including those pertaining to environmental, health, and safety (“EHS”) that govern, among other things, air and water emissions, worker protection, and the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials. Compliance with EHS laws and regulations is a major consideration for us because we use hazardous materials in our manufacturing processes. If we violate EHS laws and regulations, we could be liable for substantial fines, penalties, and costs of mandated remedial actions and we could suffer reputational damages due to any such violations. Our environmental permits could also be revoked or modified, which could require us to cease or limit production at one or more of our facilities, thereby materially adversely affecting our business, financial condition and operating results. EHS laws and regulations have generally become more stringent over time and could continue to do so, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with any violation, which also could materially affect our business, financial condition and operating results.  We have been notified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), state environmental agencies and, in some cases, groups of potentially responsible parties, that we are potentially liable for environmental contamination at several sites currently and formerly owned or operated by us, including sites designated as National Priorities List sites under the EPA’s Superfund program. Superfund liability is joint and several and we may be held responsible for more than our share of contamination at a site. On February 8, 2023, we received a demand letter from the EPA seeking reimbursement of its past response costs and interest thereon in the amount of $9,955 relating to the CTS of Asheville, Inc. Superfund Site, from the three potentially responsible parties associated with the site, including the Company. See Note 11 ""Contingencies"" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Although we estimate our potential environmental liability and reserve for such matters, including the Asheville site, we cannot assure you that our reserves will be sufficient to cover the actual costs that we incur as a result of these matters.  Future events, such as the notification of potential liability at new sites, the discovery of additional contamination or changes to an approved remedy at an existing site, changes to existing EHS laws and regulations or their interpretation, and more rigorous regulatory action by government authorities, may require additional expenditures by us, which could have a negative impact on our operations.  Changes in tax, environmental, trade or other regulations or failure to comply with existing licensing, trade and other regulations could cause volatility or have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.    Future changes to U.S. or foreign tax and trade policies, impositions of new or increased tariffs, other trade restrictions or other government actions, including any government shutdown, may lead to the continuation or escalation of such risks and uncertainty.  In addition, changes to existing tax laws or the adoption of new tax laws, particularly in the U.S. and EU, could have a material adverse impact to our effective tax rate and future cash tax liabilities. The current economic and political environment may result in significant tax law changes in the numerous jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, our effective tax rate could be materially affected by certain tax proposals developed by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and European Commission regarding the taxation of multinational businesses. Continued economic and political pressures to increase tax revenues in jurisdictions in which we operate, or the adoption of new or reformed tax legislation or regulation, may make resolving tax disputes more difficult. The final resolution of tax audits and any related litigation can differ from our historical provisions and accruals, resulting in an adverse effect on our financial performance. Additionally, modifications of laws and policies governing foreign trade and investment, including trade agreements and tariffs such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or the European Union-United Kingdom Trade and Cooperating Agreement, could adversely affect our supply chain, business and results of operations. The implementation of additional tariffs and retaliatory tariffs from trade partners or related uncertainties could further increase the cost of certain of our imported materials, thereby adversely affecting our profitability. Failure to comply with existing laws and regulations or changes in these laws, regulations, or interpretations thereof, specifically tax and environmental laws or any other laws or regulations could result in the loss, revocation or suspension of our licenses, permits or approvals and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of, and potential future developments in, complex domestic and international tax laws and regulations, the amount and timing of future taxable income and the interaction of such laws and regulations among jurisdictions. Given the wide range of international business relationships and the long-term nature and complexity of existing contractual agreements, differences arising between the actual results and assumptions made, or future changes to such assumptions, could necessitate future adjustments to tax income and expense already recorded.CTS CORPORATION 13Table of Contents     Negative or unexpected tax consequences could adversely affect our results of operations.  We operate globally and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results. The international tax environment continues to change as a result of both coordinated actions by governments and unilateral measures enacted by individual countries, which could significantly impact our effective tax rate, tax liabilities, and ability to utilize deferred tax assets.  Adverse changes in the underlying profitability and financial outlook of our operations in several jurisdictions could lead to changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and other tax accruals that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, acquisitions or divestitures may cause our effective tax rate to change.  We base our tax positions upon the anticipated nature and conduct of our business and upon our understanding of the tax laws of the various countries in which we have assets or conduct activities. However, our tax positions are subject to review and possible challenge by taxing authorities and to possible changes in law, which may have a retroactive effect.   Risks Related to Indebtedness and Financing  Our indebtedness may adversely affect our financial health.  Our indebtedness could, among other things: increase our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions, including recessions; require us to use cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and other expenses; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness; or limit our ability to borrow additional funds that may be needed to operate and expand our business.   Our credit facility contains provisions that could materially restrict our business.  Our revolving credit facility contains restrictions limiting our ability to: dispose of assets; incur certain additional debt; repay other debt or amend subordinated debt instruments; create liens on assets; make investments, loans or advances; make acquisitions or engage in mergers or consolidations; engage in certain transactions with our subsidiaries and affiliates; repurchase stock; or make dividend payments above a certain amount.  The restrictions contained in our credit facility could limit our ability to plan for or react to changes in market conditions or meet capital needs or could otherwise restrict our activities or business plans. These restrictions could adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, make strategic acquisitions, fund investments or other capital needs or engage in other business activities that could be in our interest.  Further, our ability to comply with our loan covenants may be affected by events beyond our control that could result in an event of default under our credit facility, or documents governing any other existing or future indebtedness. A default, if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of our indebtedness. In addition, our lenders could terminate their commitments to make further extensions of credit under our credit facility. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds to pay the accelerated indebtedness or that we will have the ability to refinance accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us, or at all.  The estimates and assumptions on which our financial projections are based may prove to be inaccurate, which may cause our actual results to materially differ from such projections, which may adversely affect our future profitability, cash flows and stock price.   Our financial projections, including any sales or earnings guidance or outlook we may provide from time to time, are dependent on certain estimates and assumptions related to, among other things, development and launch of innovative new products, market share projections, product pricing, sales, volume and product mix, foreign exchange rates and volatility, tax rates, interest rates, commodity prices, cost savings, accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves, and our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to reinvest in our existing business, fund internal growth, repurchase of our stock, make acquisitions, pay dividends and meet debt obligations. There is no assurance that we will fully realize the anticipated cost savings and other benefits of our restructuring activities in the time frames we desire or at all. Our financial projections are based on historical experience and on various other estimates and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made, and our actual results may differ materially from our financial projections. Any material variation between our financial projections and our actual results may adversely affect our future profitability, cash flows and stock price.  CTS CORPORATION 14Table of Contents Risks Related to COVID-19 Pandemic and Other External Factors  Public health issues such as the COVID-19 pandemic have adversely affected, and could in the future, adversely affect our business or financial results.  Any outbreaks of contagious diseases and other adverse public health developments in countries where we operate could have a material and adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected our offices and manufacturing facilities throughout the world, as well as the facilities of our suppliers, customers and their customers for the past several years. As of December 31, 2022, we continue to experience some disruptions, mainly to our operations in China. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact our business and financial results going forward will be dependent on future developments such as any additional future resurgences from known or new variants, future government regulations and actions in response to the crisis, the timing, availability, effectiveness and adoption rates of vaccines and treatments, and the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and capital markets, among many other factors, all of which remain highly uncertain and unpredictable. Given these uncertainties, we expect the pandemic to continue to have an impact on our business, operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations in 2023 and potentially beyond. There can be no assurance that the COVID-19 pandemic will not have a material and adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations in the future.   Loss, operational disruptions or closure of a key facility, including those of our suppliers, due to unforeseen or catastrophic events or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.  Our business could be interrupted and our financial results could be materially adversely impacted by physical risks such as earthquakes, fires, hurricanes, floods, acts of war, terrorist attacks, cyberattacks and other disruptions in information systems, disease outbreaks or pandemics, and other natural disasters or catastrophic events that damage, disrupt or destroy one of our key facilities or the key facilities of our significant suppliers. If any of our key facilities or the key facilities of our significant suppliers experience a significant operational disruption or catastrophic loss, it could delay, disrupt or reduce production, shipments and revenue, and result in potentially significant expenses to repair or replace these properties. Such significant disruptions could be due to, among other things:•the loss or disruption of the timely availability of adequate supplies of essential raw materials for us and our suppliers, including single-source suppliers; •our ability to integrate new suppliers into our operations;•material financial issues facing our suppliers, such as bankruptcy or similar proceedings; •transportation and logistics challenges, including as a result of port and border closures and other governmental restrictions and the availability and capacity of shipping channels; •the loss or disruption of other manufacturing, distribution and supply capabilities; •the loss or disruption of the energy sources or energy suppliers in Europe due to supply shortages as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, including price increases in the energy market; •labor shortages, strikes or work stoppages; •illness to our employees or their families or governmental restrictions on such employees' ability to travel or perform necessary business functions; or •as a result of the need for us or our suppliers to operate our respective businesses with substantial modifications to employee travel and employee work locations.  Additionally, certain catastrophes are not covered by our general insurance policies, which could result in significant unrecoverable losses. Our business and results of operations could also be adversely impacted by under-investment in physical assets or production capacity.  Climate-related events and climate change legislation could adversely impact our business.  The effects of climate change and the ongoing efforts to mitigate its impact, including through climate change-related legislation and regulation, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  The physical effects of climate change, including extreme weather and natural disasters (including those risks discussed under the heading “Loss, operational disruptions or closure of a key facility, including those of our suppliers, due to unforeseen or catastrophic events or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results”) may disrupt our operations and those of our customers and suppliers.  In addition, changes to laws or regulations enacted to address the potential impacts of climate change could have a material CTS CORPORATION 15Table of Contents adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  For example, continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national, regional, or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions. Any future increased regulation concerning greenhouse gas emissions and other climate-change related laws and regulations, may require equipment modifications, operational changes, payment of increased or additional taxes, or the purchase of emission credits to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases from our operations, which may result in us incurring substantial capital expenditures and compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs. In addition, any such future regulatory changes could result in transition risks to our business, including but not limited to (i) the nature and timing of any requirement to lower greenhouse gas emissions and adopt more energy-efficient energy use, which could result in changes or disruptions to the way we operate our business, (ii) the risk of lower demand for our products related to customers who experience business declines or disruptions due to the impact of any requirement to lower greenhouse gas emissions, (iii) financial risks where compliance with such regulations requires unforeseen capital expenditures, (iv) legal risks associated with the implementation of any new technologies required to comply with such regulations, which could impede our ability to innovate new products, meet customer and market demand or compete on pricing and quality in the market, and/or (v) reputational risks associated with our customers’ and investors’ perceptions of our business. We are not able to predict how any future definitive agreements, pacts and/or regulations, if and when they are adopted and required, and the commitments necessary to comply with such requirements, will affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  General Risk Factors
 Unfavorable outcomes of legal or regulatory matters may adversely affect our business and financial condition and damage our reputation.  We are from time to time involved in or subject to a variety of litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings or matters related to our business, warranty claims, our intellectual property rights, alleged infringement or misappropriation by us of intellectual property rights of others, tax, environmental, privacy, insurance, ERISA and employment matters. Such matters, even those that are ultimately non-meritorious, can be complex, costly, and highly disruptive to business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and other key personnel, and may generate adverse publicity that damages our reputation. The assessment of the outcome of such matters, including our potential liability, if any, is a highly subjective process that requires judgments about future events that are not within our control and are based on the information available to management at that time. The outcome of such matters, including amounts ultimately received or paid upon judgment or settlement, may differ materially from management’s outlook or estimates, including any amounts accrued in the financial statements. Actual outcomes, including judgments, awards, settlements or orders, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, or cash flows and damage our reputation.  We face risks relating to our international operations.  Because we have significant international operations, our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by economic, political, health, regulatory and other factors existing in foreign countries in which we operate. Our international operations are subject to inherent risks, which may materially adversely affect us, including: political and economic instability in countries in which our products are manufactured; expropriation or the imposition of government controls; changes in government regulations; export license requirements; trade restrictions; earnings repatriation and expatriation restrictions; exposure to different legal standards, including related to intellectual property; health conditions and standards; currency controls; fluctuations in exchange rates; increases in the duties and taxes we pay; inflation or deflation; greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer payment cycles; changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing our international operations; limitations on insurance coverage against geopolitical risks, natural disasters, and business operations; and communication among and with management of international operations. In addition, these same factors may also place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to some of our foreign competitors.  We may face risks associated with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws (collectively, ""Anti-Bribery Laws""). Anti-Bribery Laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our Code of Ethics mandates compliance with these Anti-Bribery Laws. We operate in many parts of the world where strict compliance with Anti-Bribery Laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We cannot assure you that our internal controls and procedures always will protect us from the detrimental actions by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for violations of Anti-Bribery Laws (either due to our own acts or inadvertence or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Public health or safety concerns and governmental restrictions that impact the availability of raw materials, labor, or the movement of goods in some of the countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.  CTS CORPORATION 16Table of Contents We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.  We transact business in various foreign countries. We present our consolidated financial statements in U.S. dollars, but a portion of our revenues and expenditures are transacted in other currencies. As a result, we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies. Additionally, we have currency exposure arising from funds held in local currencies in foreign countries. Volatility in the exchange rates between the foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Furthermore, to the extent we sell our products in foreign markets, currency fluctuations may result in our products becoming too expensive for foreign customers.  If we are unable to protect our intellectual property or we infringe or are alleged to infringe, on others' intellectual property rights, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.  The success of our business depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights and patents, obtain or license patents and operate without infringing on the intellectual property rights of others. We rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, patents, nondisclosure agreements and technical and other measures to protect our proprietary rights in our products and technology. The steps we have taken to prevent misappropriation of our technology may be inadequate. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which we operate do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Although we continue to evaluate and implement protective measures, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful. Our inability to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish or eliminate the competitive advantages that we derive from our technology, cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business.  We believe that patents will continue to play an important role in our business. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in securing patents for claims in any pending patent application or that any issued patent will provide us with any competitive advantage. We also cannot provide assurance that the patents will not be challenged by third parties or that the patents of others will not materially adversely affect our ability to do business.  We may become involved in litigation in the future to protect our intellectual property or because others may allege that we infringed on their intellectual property. These claims and any resulting lawsuit could subject us to liability for damages and invalidate our intellectual property rights. If an infringement claim is successfully asserted by a holder of intellectual property rights, we may be required to cease marketing or selling certain products, pay penalties and spend significant time and money to develop a non-infringing product or process or to obtain licenses for the technology, process or information from the holder. We may not be successful in the development of a non-infringing alternative, or licenses may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, in which case we may lose sales and profits. In addition, any litigation could be lengthy and costly and could materially adversely affect us even if we are successful in the litigation.  Loss of our key management and other personnel, or an inability to attract key management and other personnel, could materially affect our business.  We depend on our senior executive officers and other key personnel to run our business. We do not have long-term employment contracts with our key personnel. The loss of any of these officers or other key personnel could adversely affect our operations. Our future success depends on our ability to identify, attract, and retain qualified personnel on a timely basis. If we were to experience turnover of senior management or if a member of our senior management were to become ill or incapacitated, our stock price, our results of operations, our commercial and supply chain operations and our vendor or customer relationships could each be adversely impacted, and such events may make recruiting for future management positions more difficult. The labor market for many of our employees is very competitive, and wages and compensation costs continue to increase. Our ability to attract and retain key talent has been, and may continue to be, impacted by challenges in the labor market, particularly in the U.S., which has recently been experiencing wage inflation, labor shortages, a continued shift toward remote work. If we face labor shortages and/or increased labor costs as a result of increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover rates, or increases in employee benefits costs, our operating expenses could increase, which could negatively impact our growth and results of operations. Labor shortages, and higher employee turnover rates could also lead to disruptions in our business. In addition, we must successfully integrate any new management personnel that we hire within our organization, or who join our organization as a result of an acquisition, in order to achieve our operating objectives, and changes in other key management positions may temporarily affect our financial performance and results of operations as new management becomes familiar with our business.  Ineffective internal control over our financial reporting may harm our business.  We are subject to the ongoing internal control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (""Sarbanes-Oxley""). Our controls necessary for continued compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley may not operate effectively or at all times and may result in a material CTS CORPORATION 17Table of Contents weakness. The identification of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting could indicate a lack of proper controls to generate accurate financial statements. Further, the effectiveness of our internal controls may be impacted if we are unable to retain sufficient skilled finance and accounting personnel, especially in light of the increased demand for such personnel among publicly traded companies.  Global privacy, data protection and data security laws are highly complex, evolving rapidly, and may increase our costs to comply.  To conduct our operations, we may need to move data across national borders, and consequently we are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad regarding privacy, data protection and data security (""Data Protection Laws""). Data Protection Laws typically impose significant requirements and additional obligations for companies on how they collect, process and transfer personal data by enacting consumer privacy rights and imposing significant fines for non-compliance. The potential for fines and other related costs in the event of a breach of or non-compliance with existing or proposed Data Protection Laws may have an adverse effect on our financial results. Further, the regulatory framework around data custody, data privacy and breaches vary by jurisdiction and is an evolving area of law. We may not be able to limit our liability or damages in the event of such a loss.   We are exposed to, and may be adversely affected by, potential security breaches or other disruptions to our information technology systems and data security.  We rely on our information technology systems and networks, including cloud-based systems, in connection with many of our business activities, some of which are managed directly by us, while others are managed by third-party service providers and are not under our direct control. Our operations routinely involve receiving, storing, processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to our business, customers, suppliers, employees, and other sensitive matters. We have both an increasing reliance on IT systems and an increasing digital footprint as a result of changing technologies, connected devices and digital offerings, as well as expanded remote work policies. If these technologies, systems, products or services are damaged, cease to function properly, are compromised due to employee or third-party contractor error, user error, malfeasance, system errors, or other vulnerabilities, or are subject to cybersecurity attacks, such as those involving denial of service attacks, unauthorized access, malicious software, or other intrusions, including by criminals, nation states or insiders, our business may be adversely impacted. The impacts of any such circumstances could include production downtimes, operational delays, and other impacts on our operations and ability to provide products and services to our customers; compromise of confidential, proprietary or otherwise protected information, including personal information and customer confidential data; destruction, corruption, or theft of data or intellectual property; manipulation, disruption, or improper use of these technologies, systems, products or services; financial losses from fraudulent transactions, remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability; adverse media coverage; and legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations, actions and fines; and damage to our reputation. There has been a rise in the number of cyberattacks targeting confidential business information generally and in the manufacturing industry specifically. Moreover, there has been a rise in the number of cyberattacks that depend on human error or manipulation, including phishing attacks or schemes that use social engineering to gain access to systems or perpetrate wire transfer or other frauds. Furthermore, geopolitical turmoil has heightened the risk of cyberattacks.  These trends increase the likelihood of such events occurring as well as the costs associated with protecting against such attacks. It is possible for vulnerabilities in our IT systems to remain undetected for an extended period of time up to and including several years. We, and the service providers that we depend on to support our systems and business operations, are regularly the target of, and periodically respond to, cyberattacks, including phishing and denial-of-service attacks. As a result, we continuously monitor our systems to protect our technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption. In addition, we further attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of other measures, including employee training, a breach response plan, and maintenance of backup and protective systems. Further, while we maintain insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of cybersecurity risks, such insurance coverage may not cover all losses or all types of claims that arise. Notwithstanding those measures, our systems, networks, products and services remain potentially vulnerable to known or unknown cybersecurity attacks and other threats, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Environmental, social, and governance (""ESG"") issues, including those related to climate change and sustainability, may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and damage our reputation.   Companies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny relating to their ESG practices and policies. Increased focus and activism related to ESG may hinder our access to capital or negatively impact our stock price, as investors may reconsider their capital investment based on their assessment of our ESG practices and policies. In particular, investor advocacy groups, institutional investors, stockholders, employees, consumers, customers, regulators, proxy advisory services and other market participants have increasingly focused on ESG practices and policies of companies, including sustainability performance and risk mitigation efforts, and their effect on companies from an investor, consumer, customer or employee perspective. If our ESG practices do not meet investor or other stakeholder expectations CTS CORPORATION 18Table of Contents and standards or evolving regulatory requirements, our stock price, sales, ability to access capital markets, reputation and employee retention, among other things, may be negatively affected. Shareholder activism efforts or unsolicited offers from a third-party could cause a material disruption to our business and financial results.     We may be subject to various legal and business challenges due to actions instituted by shareholder activists or an unsolicited third-party offer. Perceived uncertainties as to our future direction as a result of shareholder activism may lead to the perception of a change in the direction of the business or other instability and may affect our relationships with vendors, customers, prospective and current employees and others. Proposed or future laws and regulations may increase the chance we become the target of shareholder activist campaigns, including ESG-related actions. If shareholder activist campaigns are initiated against us, our response to such actions could be costly and time-consuming, which could divert the attention and resources of our Board of Directors, Chief Executive Officer and senior management from the pursuit of our business strategies, which could harm our business, negatively impact our stock price, and have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.  Future dividends on our common stock may be restricted or eliminated.  Dividends are declared at the discretion of our Board of Directors, and future dividends will depend on our future earnings, cash flow, financial requirements and other factors. Our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock is limited under the terms of our credit agreements. Under the most restrictive terms of our credit agreements, our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock is limited, as described under “Risks Related to Indebtedness and Financing.” There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends in the future"
5,CTS,CTS CORP,2022-02-25,">Item 1A.  Risk Factors
 The following are certain risk factors that could affect our business, financial condition and operating results. These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other reports filed or furnished by us, because these factors could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those projected in any such forward-looking statements. Before you invest in us, you should know that making such an investment involves risks, including the risks described below. Although the risks are organized by headings, and each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated. You should not interpret the disclosure of any risk factor to imply that the risk has not already materialized. The risks that are highlighted below are not the only ones that we face. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected. Risks Related to Our Business and Industry Because we currently derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of customers, any decrease in orders from these customers could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. We depend on a small number of customers for a substantial portion of our business, and changes in the level of our customers' orders have, in the past, had a significant impact on our results of operations. If a major customer significantly delays, reduces, or cancels the level of business it does with us, there could be an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Significant pricing and margin pressures exerted by a major customer could also materially adversely affect our operating results. In addition, we generate significant accounts receivable from sales to our major customers. If one or more of our major customers were to become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay or were to delay payment for our products, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. Our customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities or locations or delay production. We generally receive volume estimates, but not firm volume commitments from our customers, and may experience reduced or extended lead times in customer orders. Customers may cancel orders, change production quantities and delay production for a number of reasons. Uncertain economic and geopolitical conditions may result in some of our customers delaying the delivery of some of the products we manufacture for them and placing purchase orders for lower volumes of products than previously anticipated. Cancellations, reductions or delays by a significant customer or by a number of customers may harm our results of operations by reducing the volumes of products we manufacture and sell, as well as by causing a delay in the recovery of our expenditures for inventory in preparation for customer orders, or by reducing our asset utilization, resulting in lower profitability. CTS CORPORATION 8Table of Contents  In addition, customers may request that manufacturing of their products be transitioned from one of our facilities to another to achieve cost reductions and other objectives. Such transfers may result in inefficiencies and costs due to resulting excess capacity and overhead at one facility and capacity constraints and the inability to fulfill all orders at another. In addition, we make key decisions based on our estimates of customer requirements, including determining the levels of orders that we will seek and accept, production schedules, component procurement commitments, personnel needs and other resource requirements. Changes in demand for our customers’ products may reduce our ability to estimate future customer requirements accurately. This may make it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of our manufacturing capacity. Anticipated orders may not materialize and delivery schedules may be deferred as a result of changes in demand for our products or our customers' products. We often increase staffing and capacity, and incur other expenses to meet the anticipated demand of our customers, which causes reductions in our gross margins if customer orders are delayed or canceled. On occasion, customers may require rapid increases in production, which may stress our resources and reduce margins. We may not have sufficient capacity at any given time to meet our customers' demands. In addition, because many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed over the short-term, a reduction in customer demand could harm our gross margin and operating income until such time as adjustments can be made to activity and operating levels or to structural costs. We sell products to customers in cyclical industries that are subject to significant downturns that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. We sell products to customers in cyclical industries that have experienced economic and industry downturns. The markets for our products have softened in the past and may again soften in the future. We may face reduced end-customer demand, underutilization of our manufacturing capacity, changes in our revenue mix and other factors that could adversely affect our results.  We are susceptible to trends and factors affecting industries that we serve. Factors negatively affecting the industries we serve and the demand for their products could negatively affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Any adverse occurrence, including among others, industry slowdown, recession, public health crisis, political instability, costly or constraining regulations, increased tariffs, reduced government budgets and spending, armed hostilities, terrorism, excessive inflation, including the current high inflationary environment, prolonged disruptions in one or more of our customers' production schedules or labor disturbances, that results in a decline in the volume of sales in these industries, or in an overall downturn in the business and operations of our customers in these industries, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. These industries may be unionized and some of our customers have experienced labor disruptions in the past. Furthermore, these industries can be highly cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, consumer preferences and interest rates. The insolvency of customers that we serve may result in the failure to receive payment in full for products sold in the past and an abrupt reduction in demand for certain products. Weakness in demand, the insolvency of customers that we serve or their suppliers, and constriction of credit markets may negatively and materially affect our facility utilization, cost structure, financial condition, and operating results. Our operating results may vary significantly from period to period. We experience fluctuations in our operating results. Some of the principal factors that contribute to these fluctuations are: changes in demand for our products; our effectiveness in managing manufacturing processes, costs and timing of our component purchases so that components are available when needed for production, while mitigating the risks of purchasing inventory in excess of immediate production needs; the degree to which we are able to utilize our available manufacturing capacity; changes in the cost and availability of components, which often occur in the electronics manufacturing industry and which affect our margins and our ability to meet delivery schedules; general economic and served industry conditions; and local conditions and events that may affect our production volumes, such as labor conditions or political instability. We may experience shortages and increased costs of raw material and required electronic components. Unanticipated raw material or electronic component shortages may prevent us from making scheduled shipments to customers. Our inability to make scheduled shipments could cause us to experience a shortfall in revenue, increase our costs and adversely affect our relationship with affected customers and our reputation as a reliable supplier. We may be required to pay higher prices for raw materials or electronic components in short supply and order these raw materials or electronic components in greater quantities to compensate for variable delivery times. We may also be required to pay higher prices for raw materials or electronic components due to inflationary trends regardless of supply, including the current high inflationary environment. We are also dependent on our suppliers' ability to supply and deliver raw materials on a timely basis at negotiated prices. Any delay or inability to deliver raw materials by our suppliers may require that we attempt to mitigate such failure or fail to make deliveries to our customers on a timely basis. As a result, raw material or electronic component shortages, price increases, or failure to perform by our suppliers could adversely affect our operating results for a particular period due to the resulting revenue shortfall and/or increased costs.CTS CORPORATION 9 In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent supply chain uncertainties have had a significant negative impact on the global economy in 2020 and 2021, including negatively impacting the global supply chain and increasing the cost of materials and operations, particularly within the global automotive industry. Key semiconductor chip and other critical part shortages continue to force original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) to shut down production, often on short notice. With customers changing orders on short notice, we run the risk of carrying excess inventory in these situations. In addition, the supply chain shortages have negatively impacted, and could continue to negatively impact, our manufacturing costs and logistics costs and, in turn, our gross margins.   We may pursue acquisition opportunities that complement or expand our business as well as divestitures that could impact our business operations. We may not be able to complete these transactions, and these transactions, if executed, may pose risks that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. On an ongoing basis we explore opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that could complement, enhance or expand our current business or product lines or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities. We may have difficulty finding suitable opportunities or, if we do identify these opportunities, we may not be able to complete the transactions for any number of reasons including a failure to secure financing. In addition, we may not be able to successfully or profitably integrate, operate, maintain and manage our newly acquired operations or employees. Any transactions that we are able to identify and complete may involve a number of risks, including: the diversion of management's attention from our existing business to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired or combined business; possible adverse effects on our operating results during the integration process; difficulties managing and integrating operations in geographically dispersed locations; increases in our expenses and working capital requirements, which could reduce our return on invested capital; exposure to unanticipated liabilities of acquired companies; and our possible inability to achieve the intended objectives of the transaction. Even if we are initially successful in integrating a new operation, we may not be able to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, and this may lead to operational inefficiencies. In addition, future acquisitions may result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of additional debt. These and other factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability from acquired operations or realize other anticipated benefits of an acquisition and could adversely affect our business and operating results. We have in the past, and may in the future, consider divesting certain business operations. Divestitures may involve a number of risks, including the diversion of management's attention, significant costs and expenses, the loss of customer relationships and cash flow, and the disruption of operations in the affected business. Failure to timely complete or consummate a divestiture may negatively affect valuation of the affected business or result in restructuring charges. We may restructure our operations or fail to execute capital projects as planned, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. We have announced and initiated restructuring plans or capital projects at various times in the recent past designed to revise and consolidate certain aspects of our operations for the purpose of improving our cost structure and operational efficiency. We may incur restructuring and impairment charges in the future if circumstances warrant. Additionally, if we are unsuccessful in implementing restructuring plans or in executing capital projects, we may experience disruptions in our operations and higher ongoing costs, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. We may be unable to compete effectively against competitors. The industries in which we operate are highly competitive and characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change. We compete against many domestic and foreign companies, some of which have substantially greater manufacturing, financial, research and development, and marketing resources than we do. If any customer becomes dissatisfied with our prices, quality, or timeliness of delivery, among other things, it could award business to our competitors. Moreover, some of our customers could choose to manufacture and develop particular products themselves rather than purchase them from us. Increased competition could result in price reductions, reduced profit margins and loss of market share, each of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. These developments also may materially adversely affect our ability to compete successfully going forward. We cannot assure you that our products will continue to compete successfully with our competitors' products. We may be unable to keep pace with rapid technological changes that could make some of our products or processes obsolete before we realize a return on our investment. The technologies relating to some of our products have undergone and are continuing to undergo changes. End markets for our products are characterized by technological change, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, changes in customer requirements, and emerging industry standards. The introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable before we can recover any or all of our research, development and commercialization expenses, or our capital investments. Furthermore, the life cycles of our products and the products we manufacture for others vary, may change, and are difficult to estimate. CTS CORPORATION 10Table of Contents  We may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of new products or product enhancements and our new products or product enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance. If we are unable, for technological or other reasons, to develop and market new products or product enhancements in a timely and cost-effective manner, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. Products we manufacture may contain design or manufacturing defects that could result in reduced demand for our products or services and liability claims against us. Despite our quality control and quality assurance efforts, defects may occur in the products we manufacture due to design or manufacturing errors, supplier quality issues, or component failure. Product defects could result in delayed shipments and reduced demand for our products. We may be subject to increased costs due to warranty claims on defective products. Product defects could result in product liability claims against us where defects cause, or are alleged to cause, property damage, bodily injury or death. As we grow our business, the risk of exposure to product liability litigation increases. We may be required to participate in a recall involving products which are, or are alleged to be, defective. We carry insurance for certain legal matters involving product liability; however, costs related to product defects and the costs of such claims, including costs of defense and settlement, may exceed our available coverage. Accordingly, our results of operations, cash flow and financial position could be adversely affected. We are subject to government regulations, including environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, that expose us to potential financial liability. Our operations are regulated by a number of federal, state, local and foreign government regulations, including those pertaining to environmental, health, and safety (“EHS”) that govern, among other things, air and water emissions, worker protection, and the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials. Compliance with EHS laws and regulations is a major consideration for us because we use hazardous materials in our manufacturing processes. If we violate EHS laws and regulations, we could be liable for substantial fines, penalties, and costs of mandated remedial actions and we could suffer reputational damages due to any such violations. Our environmental permits could also be revoked or modified, which could require us to cease or limit production at one or more of our facilities, thereby materially adversely affecting our business, financial condition and operating results. EHS laws and regulations have generally become more stringent over time and could continue to do so, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with any violation, which also could materially affect our business, financial condition and operating results. We have been notified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, state environmental agencies and, in some cases, groups of potentially responsible parties, that we are potentially liable for environmental contamination at several sites currently and formerly owned or operated by us, including sites designated as National Priorities List sites under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Superfund program. Superfund liability is joint and several and we may be held responsible for more than our share of contamination at a site. Although we estimate our potential environmental liability and reserve for such matters, we cannot assure you that our reserves will be sufficient to cover the actual costs that we incur as a result of these matters. Future events, such as the notification of potential liability at new sites, the discovery of additional contamination or changes to an approved remedy at existing sites, changes to existing EHS laws and regulations or their interpretation, and more rigorous regulatory action by government authorities, may require additional expenditures by us, which could have a negative impact on our operations. In addition, we could be affected by future laws or regulations imposed in response to climate change concerns. Such laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Climate change initiatives may result in significant operational changes and expenditures, reduce demand for our products and adversely affect our business. We recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern. Continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national, regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions. These agreements and measures may require equipment modifications, operational changes, taxes, or purchase of emission credits to reduce emission of greenhouse gases from our operations, which may result in substantial capital expenditures and compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs. Regulatory initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas usage may also adversely impact some of the industries we serve and our supply chain, adversely impacting our sales and the value of our business. Regulations related to conflict minerals could adversely impact our business. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo (""DRC"") and adjoining countries. As a result, the SEC adopted annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who may use conflict minerals mined from the DRC and adjoining countries in their products. There have been and will continue to be costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including diligence costs to determine the sources of minerals used in CTS CORPORATION 11 our products and other potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply to the extent necessary as a consequence of such verification activities. These rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products. As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering conflict-free minerals, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary conflict-free minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain conflict minerals or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all minerals used in our products through the procedures we may implement. Negative or unexpected tax consequences could adversely affect our results of operations. We operate globally and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results. The international tax environment continues to change as a result of both coordinated actions by governments and unilateral measures enacted by individual countries, such as the comprehensive tax reform enacted in the U.S. in 2017, which could significantly impact our effective tax rate, tax liabilities, and ability to utilize deferred tax assets. Adverse changes in the underlying profitability and financial outlook of our operations in several jurisdictions could lead to changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and other tax accruals that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, acquisitions or divestitures may cause our effective tax rate to change. We base our tax positions upon the anticipated nature and conduct of our business and upon our understanding of the tax laws of the various countries in which we have assets or conduct activities. However, our tax positions are subject to review and possible challenge by taxing authorities and to possible changes in law, which may have a retroactive effect. Future dividends on our common stock may be restricted or eliminated. Dividends are declared at the discretion of our Board of Directors, and future dividends will depend on our future earnings, cash flow, financial requirements and other factors. Our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock is limited under the terms of our credit agreements. Under the most restrictive terms of our credit agreements, our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock is limited, as described under “Risks Related to Indebtedness and Financing.” There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends in the future. Risks Related to Indebtedness and Financing Our indebtedness may adversely affect our financial health. Our indebtedness could, among other things: increase our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions, including recessions; require us to use cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and other expenses; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness; or limit our ability to borrow additional funds that may be needed to operate and expand our business.  Our credit facility contains provisions that could materially restrict our business. Our revolving credit facility contains restrictions limiting our ability to: dispose of assets; incur certain additional debt; repay other debt or amend subordinated debt instruments; create liens on assets; make investments, loans or advances; make acquisitions or engage in mergers or consolidations; engage in certain transactions with our subsidiaries and affiliates; repurchase stock; or make dividend payments above a certain amount. The restrictions contained in our credit facility could limit our ability to plan for or react to changes in market conditions or meet capital needs or could otherwise restrict our activities or business plans. These restrictions could adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, make strategic acquisitions, fund investments or other capital needs or engage in other business activities that could be in our interest. Further, our ability to comply with our loan covenants may be affected by events beyond our control that could result in an event of default under our credit facility, or documents governing any other existing or future indebtedness. A default, if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of our indebtedness. In addition, our lenders could terminate their commitments to make further extensions of credit under our credit facility. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds to pay the accelerated indebtedness or that we will have the ability to refinance accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us, or at all. The discontinuation of London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate may negatively impact our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. CTS CORPORATION 12Table of Contents  Borrowings under our amended and restated unsecured Revolving Credit Facility may bear interest, at our election, at a rate per annum that is based upon the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”). Although SOFR has been endorsed by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee as its preferred replacement for LIBOR, it remains uncertain whether or when SOFR or other alternative reference rates will be widely accepted by lenders as the replacement for LIBOR. This may, in turn, impact the liquidity of the SOFR loan market, and SOFR itself. Since the initial publication of SOFR, daily changes in the rate have, on occasion, been more volatile than daily changes in comparable benchmark or market rates, and SOFR over time may bear little or no relation to the historical actual or historical indicative data. Additionally, our Revolving Credit Facility includes a credit adjustment on SOFR due to LIBOR representing an unsecured lending rate while SOFR represents a secured lending rate. The possible volatility of and uncertainty around SOFR as a LIBOR replacement rate and the applicable credit adjustment could result in higher borrowing costs for us, which would adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, our Revolving Credit Facility provides the ability to borrow in alternative currencies to the us dollar. These borrowings would also be at alternative reference rates to LIBOR that, in some cases, are still being developed. In each case, the funds are subject to an applicable rate as well as an applicable credit adjustment. If funds are drawn under these currencies, it may also result in higher borrowing costs for us, which would adversely affect our liquidity, financial condition, and results of operations. Risks Related to COVID-19 Pandemic and Other External Factors Public health issues such as the COVID-19 pandemic have adversely affected, and could in the future, adversely affect our business or financial results. Any outbreaks of contagious diseases and other adverse public health developments in countries where we operate could have a material and adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has affected our offices and manufacturing facilities throughout the world, as well as the facilities of our suppliers, customers and their customers. The COVID-19 pandemic caused widespread disruptions to our Company during the first half of 2020, and to a lesser extent, those disruptions continued during the second half of 2020 and throughout all of 2021. As of December 31, 2021, we continue to experience some disruptions, and at a minimum, particularly given the surge of COVID-19 cases resulting from the Omicron variant, we expect those disruptions to continue into 2022 and potentially beyond. These disruptions have included and may continue to include government regulations that inhibit our ability to operate certain of our facilities in the ordinary course, travel restrictions, supplier constraints, supply-chain interruptions, logistics challenges and limitations, labor disruptions and reduced demand from certain customers. During 2021 and into 2022, there have been resurgences in COVID-19 cases in several regions around the world, particularly related to new variant strains, including Delta and Omicron. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact our business and financial results going forward will be dependent on future developments such as the length and severity of the crisis, the impact of the recent resurgence of the crisis due to the Omicron variant, as well as any additional future resurgences from known or new variants, future government regulations and actions in response to the crisis, the timing, availability, effectiveness and adoption rates of vaccines and treatments, and the overall impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and capital markets, among many other factors, all of which remain highly uncertain and unpredictable. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic could impact the health of our management team and other employees. Given these uncertainties, we expect the pandemic to continue to have an impact on our business, operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations in 2022 and potentially beyond. There can be no assurance that the COVID-19 pandemic will not have a material and adverse effect on our business, operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations in the future. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has and continues to increase the likelihood and potential severity of other risks (some discussed separately within this Item 1A. Risk Factors
), including but not limited to, the following:  •Our efforts to comply with any legally required vaccine mandates amongst some or all of our employees, could lead to increased labor attrition, along with potential difficulties in attracting and recruiting personnel, which could have a negative impact on our business and operations. In addition, employees in certain geographies could choose to take legal action against the Company if we institute vaccine mandates. •A scarcity of resources or other hardships caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may result in increased nationalism, protectionism and political tensions which may cause governments and/or other entities to take actions that may have a significant negative impact on the ability of the Company, its suppliers and its customers to conduct business. •Certain subsets of our employee population continue to work in a “hybrid” or remote work environment in an effort to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. This change may exacerbate certain risks to our business, including an increased demand for information technology resources, an increased risk of phishing and other cybersecurity attacks, and an increased risk of unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information. •Travel restrictions to certain countries have limited our executive management’s ability to visit certain operations during the last two years and such restrictions could remain in place for all of 2022 and beyond. •Given the current inflationary wage environment and strong demand for skilled labor in many of the countries and regions in which we operate, the ability to identify and attract new talent, as well as retain existing talent, may prove to be difficult. In CTS CORPORATION 13  particular, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, many workers around the world have re-assessed their career plans and priorities, which could lead to increased difficulty of the Company in retaining its experienced team members. •If there is a general market downturn and continued high degree of volatility in the financial markets, we may experience a material re-valuation and non-cash charge to our income statement relating to any of our critical accounting estimates, including, but not limited to, our inventory reserves or goodwill and long-lived assets. Natural disasters and adverse weather conditions may adversely impact our capability to supply product to our customers. Natural disasters, such as storms, flooding and associated power outages, and adverse weather conditions (including that caused by climate change) occurring at any of our locations or supplier locations may lead to disruption of our manufacturing operations and supply chain, adversely impacting our capability to supply product to our customers. In the event of a natural disaster or adverse weather conditions, it may not be possible for us to find an alternate manufacturing location for certain product lines, further impacting our capability to recover from such a disruption. Climate related events and climate change legislation could adversely impact our business. The effects of climate change and the ongoing efforts to mitigate its impact, including through climate change-related legislation and regulation, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  The physical effects of climate change, including extreme weather and natural disasters (including those risks discussed under the heading “Natural disasters and adverse weather conditions may adversely impact our capability to supply products to our customers”) may disrupt our operations and those of our customers and suppliers.  In addition, changes to laws or regulations enacted to address the potential impacts of climate change could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  For example, continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national, regional, or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions.  Any future increased regulation concerning greenhouse gas emissions and other climate-change related laws and regulations, may require equipment modifications, operational changes, taxes, or the purchase of emission credits to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases from our operations, which may result in us incurring substantial capital expenditures and compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs.  In addition, any such future regulatory changes could result in transition risks to our business, including but not limited to (i) the nature and timing of any requirement to lower greenhouse gas emissions and adopt more energy-efficient energy use, which could result in changes or disruptions to the way we operate our business, (ii) the risk of lower demand for our products related to customers who experience business declines or disruptions due to the impact of any requirement to lower greenhouse gas emissions, (iii) financial risks where compliance with such regulations requires unforeseen capital expenditures, (iv) legal risks associated with the implementation of any new technologies required to comply with such regulations, which could impede our ability to innovate new products, meet customer and market demand or compete on pricing and quality in the market, and/or (v) reputational risks associated with our customers’ and investors’ perceptions of our business. We are not able to predict how any future definitive agreements, pacts and/or regulations, if and when they are adopted and required, and the commitments necessary to comply with such requirements, will affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. General Risk Factors
 We face risks relating to our international operations. Because we have significant international operations, our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by economic, political, health, regulatory and other factors existing in foreign countries in which we operate. Our international operations are subject to inherent risks, which may materially adversely affect us, including: political and economic instability in countries in which our products are manufactured; expropriation or the imposition of government controls; changes in government regulations; export license requirements; trade restrictions; earnings repatriation and expatriation restrictions; exposure to different legal standards, including related to intellectual property; health conditions and standards; currency controls; fluctuations in exchange rates; increases in the duties and taxes we pay; inflation or deflation; greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer payment cycles; changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing our international operations; limitations on insurance coverage against geopolitical risks, natural disasters, and business operations; and communication among and management of international operations. In addition, these same factors may also place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to some of our foreign competitors. We may face risks associated with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws (collectively, ""Anti-Bribery Laws""). Anti-Bribery Laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our Code of Ethics mandates compliance with these Anti-Bribery Laws. We operate in many parts of the world where strict compliance with Anti-Bribery Laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We cannot assure you that our internal controls and procedures always will protect us from the detrimental actions by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for violations of Anti-Bribery Laws (either due to our own acts or CTS CORPORATION 14Table of Contents inadvertence or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Public health or safety concerns and governmental restrictions, including measures implemented in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, that impact the availability of raw materials, labor, or the movement of goods in some of the countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. We transact business in various foreign countries. We present our consolidated financial statements in U.S. dollars, but a portion of our revenues and expenditures are transacted in other currencies. As a result, we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies. Additionally, we have currency exposure arising from funds held in local currencies in foreign countries. Volatility in the exchange rates between the foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Furthermore, to the extent we sell our products in foreign markets, currency fluctuations may result in our products becoming too expensive for foreign customers. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property or we infringe, or are alleged to infringe, on others' intellectual property rights, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The success of our business depends, in part, upon our ability to protect trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights and patents, obtain or license patents and operate without infringing on the intellectual property rights of others. We rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, patents, nondisclosure agreements and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights in our products and technology. The steps we have taken to prevent misappropriation of our technology may be inadequate. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which we operate do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Although we continue to evaluate and implement protective measures, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful. Our inability to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish or eliminate the competitive advantages that we derive from our technology, cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business. We believe that patents will continue to play an important role in our business. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in securing patents for claims in any pending patent application or that any issued patent will provide us with any competitive advantage. We also cannot provide assurance that the patents will not be challenged by third parties or that the patents of others will not materially adversely affect our ability to do business. We may become involved in litigation in the future to protect our intellectual property or because others may allege that we infringed on their intellectual property. These claims and any resulting lawsuit could subject us to liability for damages and invalidate our intellectual property rights. If an infringement claim is successfully asserted by a holder of intellectual property rights, we may be required to cease marketing or selling certain products, pay penalties and spend significant time and money to develop a non-infringing product or process or to obtain licenses for the technology, process or information from the holder. We may not be successful in the development of a non-infringing alternative, or licenses may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, in which case we may lose sales and profits. In addition, any litigation could be lengthy and costly and could materially adversely affect us even if we are successful in the litigation. Loss of our key management and other personnel, or an inability to attract key management and other personnel, could materially affect our business. We depend on our senior executive officers and other key personnel to run our business. We do not have long-term employment contracts with our key personnel. The loss of any of these officers or other key personnel could adversely affect our operations. Competition for qualified employees among companies that rely heavily on engineering and technology is at times intense, and has been particularly competitive during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the loss of qualified employees or an inability to attract, retain and motivate additional highly skilled employees required for the operation and expansion of our business could hinder our ability to conduct research and development activities and deliver marketable products successfully. Ineffective internal control over our financial reporting may harm our business. We are subject to the ongoing internal control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (""Sarbanes-Oxley""). Our controls necessary for continued compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley may not operate effectively or at all times and may result in a material weakness. The identification of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting could indicate a lack of proper controls to generate accurate financial statements. Further, the effectiveness of our internal controls may be impacted if we are unable to retain sufficient skilled finance and accounting personnel, especially in light of the increased demand for such personnel among publicly traded companies.CTS CORPORATION 15  Global privacy, data protection and data security laws are highly complex, evolving rapidly, and may increase our costs to comply. To conduct our operations, we may need to move data across national borders, and consequently we are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad regarding privacy, data protection and data security.  For example, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective in May 2018, the state of California’s California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which became effective January 1, 2020, and more recently, the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress of the People’s Republic of China’s Personal Information Protection Law (“PIPL”), which became effective on November 1, 2021, impose significant requirements and additional obligations for companies on how they collect, process and transfer personal data by enacting consumer privacy rights and imposing significant fines for non-compliance.  The potential for fines and other related costs in the event of a breach of or non-compliance with the GDPR, CCPA, PIPL or other existing or proposed data protection, data security and privacy laws and requirements may have an adverse effect on our financial results. We are exposed to, and may be adversely affected by, potential security breaches or other disruptions to our information technology systems and data security. We rely on our information technology systems and networks, including cloud-based systems, in connection with many of our business activities, some of which are managed directly by us, while others are managed by third-party service providers and are not under our direct control. Our operations routinely involve receiving, storing, processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to our business, customers, suppliers, employees, and other sensitive matters.  We have both an increasing reliance on IT systems and an increasing digital footprint as a result of changing technologies, connected devices and digital offerings, as well as expanded remote work policies.  If these technologies, systems, products or services are damaged, cease to function properly, are compromised due to employee or third-party contractor error, user error, malfeasance, system errors, or other vulnerabilities, or are subject to cybersecurity attacks, such as those involving denial of service attacks, unauthorized access, malicious software, or other intrusions, including by criminals, nation states or insiders, our business may be adversely impacted. The impacts of any such circumstances could include production downtimes, operational delays, and other impacts on our operations and ability to provide products and services to our customers; compromise of confidential, proprietary or otherwise protected information, including personal information and customer confidential data; destruction, corruption, or theft of data or intellectual property; manipulation, disruption, or improper use of these technologies, systems, products or services; financial losses from fraudulent transactions, remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability; adverse media coverage; and legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations, actions and fines; and damage to our reputation. There has been a rise in the number of cyberattacks targeting confidential business information generally and in the manufacturing industry specifically. Moreover, there has been a rise in the number of cyberattacks that depend on human error or manipulation, including phishing attacks or schemes that use social engineering to gain access to systems or perpetuate wire transfer or other frauds. These trends increase the likelihood of such events occurring as well as the costs associated with protecting against such attacks. It is possible for vulnerabilities in our IT systems to remain undetected for an extended period of time up to and including several years. We, and the service providers that we depend on to support our systems and business operations, are regularly the target of, and periodically respond to, cyberattacks, including phishing and denial-of-service attacks.  As a result, we  continuously monitor our systems to protect our technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption. In addition, we further attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of other measures, including employee training, a breach response plan, and maintenance of backup and protective systems. In addition, while we maintain insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of cybersecurity risks, such insurance coverage may not cover all losses or all types of claims that arise. Notwithstanding those measures, our systems, networks, products and services remain potentially vulnerable to known or unknown cybersecurity attacks and other threats, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results"
8,CTS,CTS CORP,2021-02-25,">Item 1A.  Risk Factors
 The following are certain risk factors that could affect our business, financial condition and operating results. These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other reports filed or furnished by us, because these factors could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those projected in any such forward-looking statements. Before you invest in us, you should know that making such an investment involves risks, including the risks described below. The risks that are highlighted below are not the only ones that we face. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected. Risks Related to Our Business and Industry Because we currently derive a substantial portion of our revenues from a small number of customers, any decrease in orders from these customers could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. We depend on a small number of customers for a substantial portion of our business, and changes in the level of our customers' orders have, in the past, had a significant impact on our results of operations. If a major customer significantly delays, reduces, or cancels the level of business it does with us, there could be an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Significant pricing and margin pressures exerted by a major customer could also materially adversely affect our operating results. In addition, we generate significant accounts receivable from sales to our major customers. If one or more of our major customers were to become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay or were to delay payment for our products, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. Our customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities or locations or delay production. We generally receive volume estimates, but not firm volume commitments from our customers, and may experience reduced or extended lead times in customer orders. Customers may cancel orders, change production quantities and delay production for a number of reasons. Uncertain economic and geopolitical conditions may result in some of our customers delaying the delivery of some of the products we manufacture for them and placing purchase orders for lower volumes of products than previously anticipated. Cancellations, reductions or delays by a significant customer or by a number of customers may harm our results of operations by reducing the volumes of products we manufacture and sell, as well as by causing a delay in the recovery of our expenditures for inventory in preparation for customer orders, or by reducing our asset utilization, resulting in lower profitability. In addition, customers may request that manufacturing of their products be transitioned from one of our facilities to another to achieve cost reductions and other objectives. Such transfers may result in inefficiencies and costs due to resulting excess capacity and overhead at one facility and capacity constraints and the inability to fulfill all orders at another. In addition, we make key decisions based on our estimates of customer requirements, including determining the levels of orders that we will seek and accept, production schedules, component procurement commitments, personnel needs and other resource requirements. Changes in demand for our customers’ products may reduce our ability to estimate future customer requirements accurately. This may make it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of our manufacturing capacity. Anticipated orders may not materialize and delivery schedules may be deferred as a result of changes in demand for our products or our customers' products. We often increase staffing and capacity, and incur other expenses to meet the anticipated demand of our customers, which causes reductions in our gross margins if customer orders are delayed or canceled. On occasion, customers may require rapid increases in production, which may stress our resources and reduce margins. We may not have sufficient capacity at any given time to meet our customers' demands. In addition, because many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed over the short-term, a reduction in customer demand could harm our gross margin and operating income until such time as adjustments can be made to activity and operating levels or to structural costs. We sell products to customers in cyclical industries that are subject to significant downturns that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.CTS CORPORATION 8Table of Contents  We sell products to customers in cyclical industries that have experienced economic and industry downturns. The markets for our products have softened in the past and may again soften in the future. We may face reduced end-customer demand, underutilization of our manufacturing capacity, changes in our revenue mix and other factors that could adversely affect our results.  We are susceptible to trends and factors affecting industries that we serve. Factors negatively affecting the industries we serve and the demand for their products could negatively affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Any adverse occurrence, including among others, industry slowdown, recession, public health crisis, political instability, costly or constraining regulations, increased tariffs, reduced government budgets and spending, armed hostilities, terrorism, excessive inflation, prolonged disruptions in one or more of our customers' production schedules or labor disturbances, that results in a decline in the volume of sales in these industries, or in an overall downturn in the business and operations of our customers in these industries, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. These industries may be unionized and some of our customers have experienced labor disruptions in the past. Furthermore, these industries can be highly cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, consumer preferences and interest rates. The failure of manufacturers that we serve may result in the failure to receive payment in full for products sold in the past and an abrupt cancellation in demand for certain products. Weakness in demand, the insolvency of manufacturers that we serve or their suppliers, and constriction of credit markets may negatively and materially affect our facility utilization, cost structure, financial condition, and operating results. Our operating results may vary significantly from period to period. We experience fluctuations in our operating results. Some of the principal factors that contribute to these fluctuations are: changes in demand for our products; our effectiveness in managing manufacturing processes, costs and timing of our component purchases so that components are available when needed for production, while mitigating the risks of purchasing inventory in excess of immediate production needs; the degree to which we are able to utilize our available manufacturing capacity; changes in the cost and availability of components, which often occur in the electronics manufacturing industry and which affect our margins and our ability to meet delivery schedules; general economic and served industry conditions; and local conditions and events that may affect our production volumes, such as labor conditions or political instability. We may experience shortages and increased costs of raw material and required electronic components. Unanticipated raw material or electronic component shortages may prevent us from making scheduled shipments to customers. Our inability to make scheduled shipments could cause us to experience a shortfall in revenue, increase our costs and adversely affect our relationship with affected customers and our reputation as a reliable supplier. We may be required to pay higher prices for raw materials or electronic components in short supply and order these raw materials or electronic components in greater quantities to compensate for variable delivery times. We may also be required to pay higher prices for raw materials or electronic components due to inflationary trends regardless of supply. We are also dependent on our suppliers' ability to supply and deliver raw materials on a timely basis at negotiated prices. Any delay or inability to deliver raw materials by our suppliers may require that we attempt to mitigate such failure or fail to make deliveries to our customers on a timely basis. As a result, raw material or electronic component shortages, price increases, or failure to perform by our suppliers could adversely affect our operating results for a particular period due to the resulting revenue shortfall and/or increased costs. We may pursue acquisition opportunities that complement or expand our business as well as divestitures that could impact our business operations. We may not be able to complete these transactions, and these transactions, if executed, may pose risks that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. On an ongoing basis we explore opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that could complement, enhance or expand our current business or product lines or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities. We may have difficulty finding suitable opportunities or, if we do identify these opportunities, we may not be able to complete the transactions for any number of reasons including a failure to secure financing. In addition, we may not be able to successfully or profitably integrate, operate, maintain and manage our newly acquired operations or employees. Any transactions that we are able to identify and complete may involve a number of risks, including: the diversion of management's attention from our existing business to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired or combined business; possible adverse effects on our operating results during the integration process; difficulties managing and integrating operations in geographically dispersed locations; increases in our expenses and working capital requirements, which could reduce our return on invested capital; exposure to unanticipated liabilities of acquired companies; and our possible inability to achieve the intended objectives of the transaction. Even if we are initially successful in integrating a new operation, we may not be able to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, and this may lead to operational inefficiencies. In addition, future acquisitions may result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of additional debt. These and other factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability from acquired operations or realize other anticipated benefits of an acquisition and could adversely affect our business and operating results. CTS CORPORATION 9We have in the past, and may in the future, consider divesting certain business operations. Divestitures may involve a number of risks, including the diversion of management's attention, significant costs and expenses, the loss of customer relationships and cash flow, and the disruption of operations in the affected business. Failure to timely complete or consummate a divestiture may negatively affect valuation of the affected business or result in restructuring charges. We may restructure our operations or fail to execute capital projects as planned, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. We have announced and initiated restructuring plans or capital projects at various times in the recent past designed to revise and consolidate certain aspects of our operations for the purpose of improving our cost structure and operational efficiency. We may incur restructuring and impairment charges in the future if circumstances warrant. Additionally, if we are unsuccessful in implementing restructuring plans or in executing capital projects, we may experience disruptions in our operations and higher ongoing costs, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. We may be unable to compete effectively against competitors. The industries in which we operate are highly competitive and characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change. We compete against many domestic and foreign companies, some of which have substantially greater manufacturing, financial, research and development, and marketing resources than we do. If any customer becomes dissatisfied with our prices, quality, or timeliness of delivery, among other things, it could award business to our competitors. Moreover, some of our customers could choose to manufacture and develop particular products themselves rather than purchase them from us. Increased competition could result in price reductions, reduced profit margins and loss of market share, each of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. These developments also may materially adversely affect our ability to compete successfully going forward. We cannot assure you that our products will continue to compete successfully with our competitors' products. We may be unable to keep pace with rapid technological changes that could make some of our products or processes obsolete before we realize a return on our investment. The technologies relating to some of our products have undergone and are continuing to undergo changes. End markets for our products are characterized by technological change, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, changes in customer requirements, and emerging industry standards. The introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable before we can recover any or all of our research, development and commercialization expenses, or our capital investments. Furthermore, the life cycles of our products and the products we manufacture for others vary, may change, and are difficult to estimate. We may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of new products or product enhancements and our new products or product enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance. If we are unable, for technological or other reasons, to develop and market new products or product enhancements in a timely and cost-effective manner, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. Products we manufacture may contain design or manufacturing defects that could result in reduced demand for our products or services and liability claims against us. Despite our quality control and quality assurance efforts, defects may occur in the products we manufacture due to design or manufacturing errors, supplier quality issues, or component failure. Product defects could result in delayed shipments and reduced demand for our products. We may be subject to increased costs due to warranty claims on defective products. Product defects could result in product liability claims against us where defects cause, or are alleged to cause, property damage, bodily injury or death. As we grow our business in the transportation and medical device markets, the risk of exposure to product liability litigation increases. We may be required to participate in a recall involving products which are, or are alleged to be, defective. We carry insurance for certain legal matters involving product liability; however, costs related to product defects and the costs of such claims, including costs of defense and settlement, may exceed our available coverage. Accordingly, our results of operations, cash flow and financial position could be adversely affected. We are subject to government regulations, including environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations, that expose us to potential financial liability. Our operations are regulated by a number of federal, state, local and foreign government regulations, including those pertaining to environmental, health, and safety (“EHS”) that govern, among other things, air and water emissions, worker protection, and the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials. Compliance with EHS laws and regulations is a major consideration for us because we use hazardous materials in our manufacturing processes. If we violate EHS laws and regulations, we could be liable for CTS CORPORATION 10Table of Contents substantial fines, penalties, and costs of mandated remedial actions. Our environmental permits could also be revoked or modified, which could require us to cease or limit production at one or more of our facilities, thereby materially adversely affecting our business, financial condition and operating results. EHS laws and regulations have generally become more stringent over time and could continue to do so, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with any violation, which also could materially affect our business, financial condition and operating results. We have been notified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, state environmental agencies and, in some cases, groups of potentially responsible parties, that we are potentially liable for environmental contamination at several sites currently and formerly owned or operated by us, including sites designated as National Priorities List sites under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Superfund program. Superfund liability is joint and several and we may be held responsible for more than our share of contamination at a site. Although we estimate our potential environmental liability and reserve for such matters, we cannot assure you that our reserves will be sufficient to cover the actual costs that we incur as a result of these matters. Future events, such as the notification of potential liability at new sites, the discovery of additional contamination or changes to an approved remedy at existing sites, changes to existing EHS laws and regulations or their interpretation, and more rigorous regulatory action by government authorities, may require additional expenditures by us, which could have a negative impact on our operations. In addition, we could be affected by future laws or regulations imposed in response to climate change concerns. Such laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Climate change initiatives may result in significant operational changes and expenditures, reduce demand for our products and adversely affect our business. We recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern. Continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national, regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions. These agreements and measures may require equipment modifications, operational changes, taxes, or purchase of emission credits to reduce emission of greenhouse gases from our operations, which may result in substantial capital expenditures and compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs. Regulatory initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas usage may also adversely impact some of the industries we serve and our supply chain, adversely impacting our sales and the value of our business. Regulations related to conflict minerals could adversely impact our business. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo (""DRC"") and adjoining countries. As a result, the SEC adopted annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who may use conflict minerals mined from the DRC and adjoining countries in their products. There have been and will continue to be costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including diligence costs to determine the sources of minerals used in our products and other potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply to the extent necessary as a consequence of such verification activities. These rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products. As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering conflict-free minerals, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary conflict-free minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain conflict minerals or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all minerals used in our products through the procedures we may implement. Negative or unexpected tax consequences could adversely affect our results of operations. We operate globally and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results. The international tax environment continues to change as a result of both coordinated actions by governments and unilateral measures enacted by individual countries, such as the comprehensive tax reform enacted in the U.S. in 2017, which could significantly impact our effective tax rate, tax liabilities, and ability to utilize deferred tax assets. Adverse changes in the underlying profitability and financial outlook of our operations in several jurisdictions could lead to changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and other tax accruals that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, acquisitions or divestitures may cause our effective tax rate to change. We base our tax positions upon the anticipated nature and conduct of our business and upon our understanding of the tax laws of the various countries in which we have assets or conduct activities. However, our tax positions are subject to review and possible challenge by taxing authorities and to possible changes in law, which may have a retroactive effect. Risks Related to Indebtedness and Financing Our indebtedness may adversely affect our financial health. CTS CORPORATION 11Our indebtedness could, among other things: increase our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions, including recessions; require us to use cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and other expenses; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness; or limit our ability to borrow additional funds that may be needed to operate and expand our business. Moreover, an increase in interest rates could increase our interest expense. Our credit facility contains provisions that could materially restrict our business. Our revolving credit facility contains restrictions limiting our ability to: dispose of assets; incur certain additional debt; repay other debt or amend subordinated debt instruments; create liens on assets; make investments, loans or advances; make acquisitions or engage in mergers or consolidations; engage in certain transactions with our subsidiaries and affiliates; repurchase stock; or make dividend payments above a certain amount. The restrictions contained in our credit facility could limit our ability to plan for or react to changes in market conditions or meet capital needs or could otherwise restrict our activities or business plans. These restrictions could adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, make strategic acquisitions, fund investments or other capital needs or engage in other business activities that could be in our interest. Further, our ability to comply with our loan covenants may be affected by events beyond our control that could result in an event of default under our credit facility, or documents governing any other existing or future indebtedness. A default, if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of our indebtedness. In addition, our lenders could terminate their commitments to make further extensions of credit under our credit facility. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds to pay the accelerated indebtedness or that we will have the ability to refinance accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us, or at all. Losses in the financial markets could negatively impact pension asset returns and cash flow due to possible required contributions in the future. We make a number of assumptions relating to our pension plans in order to measure the financial position of the plans and the net periodic benefit cost. The most significant assumptions relate to the discount rate and the expected long-term return on plan assets. If these assumptions prove to be significantly different from actual rates, then we may need to record additional expense relating to the pension plans, which could require cash contributions to fund future pension obligation payments and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Risks Related to COVID-19 Pandemic and Other External Factors Public health issues such as the COVID-19 pandemic have adversely affected, and could in the future, adversely affect our business or financial results. The United States and other countries have experienced, and may experience in the future, outbreaks of contagious diseases that affect public health. In connection with the outbreak of the global COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the United States declared a national emergency in March 2020 and the World Health Organization, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have recommended containment and mitigation measures. Numerous states and municipalities have also declared public health emergencies. Along with these declarations, extraordinary and wide-ranging actions have been taken by international, federal, state, and local public health and governmental authorities to mitigate the impact of COVID-19, including quarantines, stay-at-home orders and business closure mandates requiring that individuals substantially restrict daily activities and that businesses substantially modify, curtail or cease normal operations. Many of these measures are currently in place in many jurisdictions where we operate, and additional measures may be imposed by governmental authorities in the future. There is significant uncertainty regarding the extent to which and how long COVID-19 and related government directives, actions and economic relief efforts will disrupt the global economy and level of employment, capital markets, consumer confidence, and demand for our products. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of COVID-19, the acceptance and effectiveness of vaccines, and the impact of COVID-19 and related containment and mitigation measures on our customers, trade partners and employees, all of which are highly uncertain, unpredictable and outside our control. If COVID-19 continues to have a significant negative impact on economic conditions over a prolonged period of time, the pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Natural disasters may adversely impact our capability to supply product to our customers. Natural disasters, such as storms, flooding and associated power outages, occurring at any of our locations or supplier locations may lead to disruption of our manufacturing operations and supply chain, adversely impacting our capability to supply product to our CTS CORPORATION 12Table of Contents customers. In the event of a natural disaster, it may not be possible for us to find an alternate manufacturing location for certain product lines, further impacting our capability to recover from such a disruption. General Risk Factors
 We face risks relating to our international operations. Because we have significant international operations, our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by economic, political, health, regulatory and other factors existing in foreign countries in which we operate. Our international operations are subject to inherent risks, which may materially adversely affect us, including: political and economic instability in countries in which our products are manufactured; expropriation or the imposition of government controls; changes in government regulations; export license requirements; trade restrictions; earnings repatriation and expatriation restrictions; exposure to different legal standards, including related to intellectual property; health conditions and standards; currency controls; fluctuations in exchange rates; increases in the duties and taxes we pay; inflation or deflation; greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer payment cycles; changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing our international operations; limitations on insurance coverage against geopolitical risks, natural disasters, and business operations; and communication among and management of international operations. In addition, these same factors may also place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to some of our foreign competitors. We may face risks associated with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (""FCPA"") and similar anti-bribery laws. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our Code of Ethics mandates compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world where strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We cannot assure you that our internal controls and procedures always will protect us from the detrimental actions by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for FCPA violations (either due to our own acts or inadvertence or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Public health or safety concerns and governmental restrictions, including measures implemented in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, that impact the availability of raw materials, labor, or the movement of goods in some of the countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. We transact business in various foreign countries. We present our consolidated financial statements in U.S. dollars, but a portion of our revenues and expenditures are transacted in other currencies. As a result, we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies. Additionally, we have currency exposure arising from funds held in local currencies in foreign countries. Volatility in the exchange rates between the foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Furthermore, to the extent we sell our products in foreign markets, currency fluctuations may result in our products becoming too expensive for foreign customers. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property or we infringe, or are alleged to infringe, on others' intellectual property rights, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. The success of our business depends, in part, upon our ability to protect trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights and patents, obtain or license patents and operate without infringing on the intellectual property rights of others. We rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, patents, nondisclosure agreements and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights in our products and technology. The steps we have taken to prevent misappropriation of our technology may be inadequate. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which we operate do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Although we continue to evaluate and implement protective measures, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful. Our inability to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish or eliminate the competitive advantages that we derive from our technology, cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business. We believe that patents will continue to play an important role in our business. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in securing patents for claims in any pending patent application or that any issued patent will provide us with any competitive advantage. We also cannot provide assurance that the patents will not be challenged by third parties or that the patents of others will not materially adversely affect our ability to do business. We may become involved in litigation in the future to protect our intellectual property or because others may allege that we infringed on their intellectual property. These claims and any resulting lawsuit could subject us to liability for damages and invalidate our CTS CORPORATION 13intellectual property rights. If an infringement claim is successfully asserted by a holder of intellectual property rights, we may be required to cease marketing or selling certain products, pay penalties and spend significant time and money to develop a non-infringing product or process or to obtain licenses for the technology, process or information from the holder. We may not be successful in the development of a non-infringing alternative, or licenses may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, in which case we may lose sales and profits. In addition, any litigation could be lengthy and costly and could materially adversely affect us even if we are successful in the litigation. Loss of our key management and other personnel, or an inability to attract key management and other personnel, could materially affect our business. We depend on our senior executive officers and other key personnel to run our business. We do not have long-term employment contracts with our key personnel. The loss of any of these officers or other key personnel could adversely affect our operations. Competition for qualified employees among companies that rely heavily on engineering and technology is at times intense, and the loss of qualified employees or an inability to attract, retain and motivate additional highly skilled employees required for the operation and expansion of our business could hinder our ability to conduct research and development activities and deliver marketable products successfully. Ineffective internal control over our financial reporting may harm our business. We are subject to the ongoing internal control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (""Sarbanes-Oxley""). Our controls necessary for continued compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley may not operate effectively or at all times and may result in a material weakness. The identification of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting could indicate a lack of proper controls to generate accurate financial statements. Further, the effectiveness of our internal controls may be impacted if we are unable to retain sufficient skilled finance and accounting personnel, especially in light of the increased demand for such personnel among publicly traded companies. We could face risks to our systems, networks and production including increased IT security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime. Increased global information technology security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and communications. While we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures - including employee training, comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems, and maintenance of backup and protective systems - our systems, networks and products remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats. Depending on their nature and scope, such threats could potentially lead to the compromising of confidential information and communications, improper use of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations. Additionally, any updates to or implementation of systems, including the selection and implementation of an ERP system, may cause delays or disruptions in our processes or production which could adversely affect our results. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with frequent imposition of new and changing requirements.  For example, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective in May 2018, and other similar U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations in this area, impose significant new requirements and additional obligations for companies on how they collect, process and transfer personal data by enhancing consumer privacy rights and imposing significant fines for non-compliance.  The potential for fines and other related costs in the event of a breach of or non-compliance with the GDPR or other existing or proposed information security or privacy laws and requirements may have an adverse effect on our financial results"
1,CTS,CTS CORP,2020-02-20,">Item 1A.  Risk Factors
The following are certain risk factors that could affect our business, financial condition and operating results. These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other reports filed or furnished by us, because these factors could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those projected in any such forward-looking statements. Before you invest in us, you should know that making such an investment involves risks, including the risks described below. The risks that are highlighted below are not the only ones that we face. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be negatively affected.Because we currently derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers, any decrease in orders from these customers could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.We depend on a small number of customers for a large portion of our business, and changes in the level of our customers' orders have, in the past, had a significant impact on our results of operations. If a major customer significantly delays, reduces, or cancels the level of business it does with us, there could be an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Significant pricing and margin pressures exerted by a major customer could also materially adversely affect our operating results. In addition, we generate significant accounts receivable from sales to our major customers. If one or more of our major customers were to become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay or were to delay payment for our products, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.Negative or unexpected tax consequences could adversely affect our results of operations.We operate globally and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results.  The international tax environment continues to change as a result of both coordinated actions by governments and unilateral measures enacted by individual countries, such as the comprehensive tax reform enacted in the U.S. in 2017, which could significantly impact our effective tax rate, tax liabilities, and ability to utilize deferred tax assets.Adverse changes in the underlying profitability and financial outlook of our operations in several jurisdictions could lead to changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and other tax accruals that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, acquisitions or divestitures may cause our effective tax rate to change.We base our tax accounting positions upon the anticipated nature and conduct of our business and upon our understanding of the tax laws of the various countries in which we have assets or conduct activities. However, our tax accounting positions are subject to review and possible challenge by taxing authorities and to possible changes in law, which may have a retroactive effect. We may be unable to compete effectively against competitors.The industries in which we operate are highly competitive and characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change. We compete against many domestic and foreign companies, some of which have substantially greater manufacturing, financial, research and development, and marketing resources than we do. If any customer becomes dissatisfied with our prices, quality, or timeliness of delivery, among other things, it could award business to our competitors. Moreover, some of our customers could choose to manufacture and develop particular products themselves rather than purchase them from us. Increased competition could result in price reductions, reduced profit margins and loss of market share, each of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. These developments also may materially adversely affect our ability to compete successfully going forward. We cannot assure you that our products will continue to compete successfully with our competitors' products, including OEMs.We may be unable to keep pace with rapid technological changes that could make some of our products or processes obsolete before we realize a return on our investment.The technologies relating to some of our products have undergone, and are continuing to undergo, rapid and significant changes. End markets for our products are characterized by technological change, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, changes in customer requirements, and emerging industry standards. The introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable before we can recover any or all of our research, development and commercialization expenses, or our capital investments. Furthermore, the life cycles of our products and the products we manufacture for others vary, may change, and are difficult to estimate.We may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of new products or product enhancements and our new products or product enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of the CTS CORPORATION 7Table of Contentsmarketplace or achieve market acceptance. If we are unable, for technological or other reasons, to develop and market new products or product enhancements in a timely and cost-effective manner, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.Our customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities or locations or delay production.We generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers, and regularly experience reduced or extended lead times in customer orders. Customers cancel orders, change production quantities and delay production for a number of reasons. Uncertain economic and geopolitical conditions may result in some of our customers delaying the delivery of some of the products we manufacture for them and placing purchase orders for lower volumes of products than previously anticipated. Cancellations, reductions or delays by a significant customer or by a number of customers may harm our results of operations by reducing the volumes of products we manufacture and sell, as well as by causing a delay in the recovery of our expenditures for inventory in preparation for customer orders, or by reducing our asset utilization, resulting in lower profitability.In addition, customers may require that manufacturing of their products be transitioned from one of our facilities to another to achieve cost reductions and other objectives. Such transfers may result in inefficiencies and costs due to resulting excess capacity and overhead at one facility and capacity constraints and the inability to fulfill all orders at another. In addition, we make key decisions based on our estimates of customer requirements, including determining the levels of orders that we will seek and accept, production schedules, component procurement commitments, personnel needs and other resource requirements. The short-term nature of our customers' commitments and the changes in demand for their products may reduce our ability to estimate future customer requirements accurately. This may make it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of our manufacturing capacity. Anticipated orders may not materialize and delivery schedules may be deferred as a result of changes in demand for our products or our customers' products. We often increase staffing and capacity, and incur other expenses to meet the anticipated demand of our customers, which causes reductions in our gross margins if customer orders are delayed or canceled. On occasion, customers require rapid increases in production, which may stress our resources and reduce margins. We may not have sufficient capacity at any given time to meet our customers' demands. In addition, because many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed over the short-term, a reduction in customer demand could harm our gross margin and operating income until such time as adjustments can be made to activity and operating levels or to structural costs.We sell products to customers in cyclical industries that are subject to significant downturns that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.We sell products to customers in cyclical industries that have experienced economic and industry downturns. The markets for our products have softened in the past and may again soften in the future. We may face reduced end-customer demand, underutilization of our manufacturing capacity, changes in our revenue mix and other factors that could adversely affect our results of operations in the near-term. We cannot predict whether we will achieve profitability in future periods.We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from customers in the transportation, information technology and telecommunications industries and are susceptible to trends and factors affecting those industries.Sales to the transportation, information technology and telecommunications industries represent a substantial portion of our revenues. Factors negatively affecting these industries and the demand for their products also negatively affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Any adverse occurrence, including among others, industry slowdown, recession, political instability, costly or constraining regulations, increased tariffs, reduced government budgets and spending, armed hostilities, terrorism, excessive inflation, prolonged disruptions in one or more of our customers' production schedules or labor disturbances, that results in a decline in the volume of sales in these industries, or in an overall downturn in the business and operations of our customers in these industries, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. These industries are generally unionized and some of our customers have experienced labor disruptions in the past. Furthermore, these industries are highly cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, consumer preferences and interest rates. The failure of manufacturers that we serve may result in the failure to receive payment in full for products sold in the past and an abrupt cancellation in demand for certain products. Weakness in demand, the insolvency of manufacturers that we serve or their suppliers, and constriction of credit markets may negatively and materially affect our facility utilization, cost structure, financial condition, and operating results.CTS CORPORATION 8 Table of ContentsProducts we manufacture may contain design or manufacturing defects that could result in reduced demand for our products or services and liability claims against us.Despite our quality control and quality assurance efforts, defects may occur in the products we manufacture due to design or manufacturing errors or component failure. Product defects could result in delayed shipments and reduced demand for our products. We may be subject to increased costs due to warranty claims on defective products. Product defects could result in product liability claims against us where defects cause, or are alleged to cause, property damage, bodily injury or death. As we grow our business in the transportation and medical device markets, the risk of exposure to product liability litigation increases. We may be required to participate in a recall involving products which are, or are alleged to be, defective. We carry insurance for certain legal matters involving product liability; however, we do not have coverage for all costs related to product defects and the costs of such claims, including costs of defense and settlement, may exceed our available coverage. Accordingly, our results of operations, cash flow and financial position could be adversely affected.We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.We transact business in various foreign countries. We present our consolidated financial statements in U.S. dollars, but a portion of our revenues and expenditures are transacted in other currencies. As a result, we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies. Additionally, we have currency exposure arising from funds held in local currencies in foreign countries. Volatility in the exchange rates between the foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Furthermore, to the extent we sell our products in foreign markets, currency fluctuations may result in our products becoming too expensive for foreign customers.Our operating results vary significantly from period to period.We experience fluctuations in our operating results. Some of the principal factors that contribute to these fluctuations are: changes in demand for our products; our effectiveness in managing manufacturing processes, costs and timing of our component purchases so that components are available when needed for production, while mitigating the risks of purchasing inventory in excess of immediate production needs; the degree to which we are able to utilize our available manufacturing capacity; changes in the cost and availability of components, which often occur in the electronics manufacturing industry and which affect our margins and our ability to meet delivery schedules; general economic and served industry conditions; and local conditions and events that may affect our production volumes, such as labor conditions or political instability.We face risks relating to our international operations.Because we have significant international operations, our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by economic, political, health, regulatory and other factors existing in foreign countries in which we operate. Our international operations are subject to inherent risks, which may materially adversely affect us, including: political and economic instability in countries in which our products are manufactured; expropriation or the imposition of government controls; changes in government regulations; export license requirements; trade restrictions; earnings repatriation and expatriation restrictions; exposure to different legal standards, including related to intellectual property; health conditions and standards; currency controls; fluctuations in exchange rates; increases in the duties and taxes we pay; inflation or deflation; greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer payment cycles; changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing our international operations; limitations on insurance coverage against geopolitical risks, natural disasters, and business operations; and communication among and management of international operations. In addition, these same factors may also place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to some of our foreign competitors.We may face risks associated with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (""FCPA"") and similar anti-bribery laws. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our Code of Ethics mandates compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world where strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We cannot assure you that our internal controls and procedures always will protect us from the detrimental actions by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for FCPA violations (either due to our own acts or inadvertence or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.CTS CORPORATION 9Table of ContentsPublic health or safety concerns and governmental restrictions, including the recent coronavirus outbreak, that impact the availability of raw materials, labor, or the movement of goods in some of the countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.We may restructure our operations or fail to execute capital projects as planned, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.We have announced and initiated restructuring plans or capital projects at various times in the recent past designed to revise and consolidate certain aspects of our operations for the purpose of improving our cost structure or manufacturing efficiency. We may incur restructuring and impairment charges in the future if circumstances warrant. Additionally, if we are unsuccessful in implementing restructuring plans or in executing capital projects, we may experience disruptions in our operations and higher ongoing costs, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.Losses in the financial markets could negatively impact pension asset returns and cash flow due to possible required contributions in the future.We make a number of assumptions relating to our pension plans in order to measure the financial position of the plans and the net periodic benefit cost. The most significant assumptions relate to the discount rate and the expected long-term return on plan assets. If these assumptions prove to be significantly different from actual rates, then we may need to record additional expense relating to the pension plans, which could require cash contributions to fund future pension obligation payments and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.We may pursue acquisition opportunities that complement or expand our business as well as divestitures that could impact our business operations. We may not be able to complete these transactions, and these transactions, if executed, may pose significant risks that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.On an ongoing basis we explore opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that could complement, enhance or expand our current business or product lines or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities. We may have difficulty finding suitable opportunities or, if we do identify these opportunities, we may not be able to complete the transactions for any number of reasons including a failure to secure financing. In addition, we may not be able to successfully or profitably integrate, operate, maintain and manage our newly acquired operations or employees. Any transactions that we are able to identify and complete may involve a number of risks, including: the diversion of management's attention from our existing business to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired or combined business; possible adverse effects on our operating results during the integration process; difficulties managing and integrating operations in geographically dispersed locations; increases in our expenses and working capital requirements, which could reduce our return on invested capital; exposure to unanticipated liabilities of acquired companies; and our possible inability to achieve the intended objectives of the transaction. Even if we are initially successful in integrating a new operation, we may not be able to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, and this may lead to operational inefficiencies. In addition, future acquisitions may result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of additional debt. These and other factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability from acquired operations or realize other anticipated benefits of an acquisition, and could adversely affect our business and operating results.We have in the past, and may in the future, consider divesting certain business operations. Divestitures may involve a number of risks, including the diversion of management's attention, significant costs and expenses, the loss of customer relationships and cash flow, and the disruption of operations in the affected business. Failure to timely complete or consummate a divestiture may negatively affect valuation of the affected business or result in restructuring charges.If we are unable to protect our intellectual property or we infringe, or are alleged to infringe, on others' intellectual property rights, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.The success of our business depends, in part, upon our ability to protect trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights and patents, obtain or license patents and operate without infringing on the intellectual property rights of others. We rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, patents, nondisclosure agreements and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights in our products and technology. The steps we have taken to prevent misappropriation of our technology may be inadequate. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which we operate do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Although we continue to evaluate and implement protective measures, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful. Our inability to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish or eliminate the competitive advantages that we derive from our technology, cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business.CTS CORPORATION 10 Table of ContentsWe believe that patents will continue to play an important role in our business. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in securing patents for claims in any pending patent application or that any issued patent will provide us with any competitive advantage. We also cannot provide assurance that the patents will not be challenged by third parties or that the patents of others will not materially adversely affect our ability to do business.We may become involved in litigation in the future to protect our intellectual property or because others may allege that we infringed on their intellectual property. These claims and any resulting lawsuit could subject us to liability for damages and invalidate our intellectual property rights. If an infringement claim is successfully asserted by a holder of intellectual property rights, we may be required to cease marketing or selling certain products, pay penalties and spend significant time and money to develop a non-infringing product or process or to obtain licenses for the technology, process or information from the holder. We may not be successful in the development of a non-infringing alternative, or licenses may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, in which case we may lose sales and profits. In addition, any litigation could be lengthy and costly and could materially adversely affect us even if we are successful in the litigation.We may experience shortages and increased costs of raw material and required electronic components.Unanticipated raw material or electronic component shortages may prevent us from making scheduled shipments to customers. Our inability to make scheduled shipments could cause us to experience a shortfall in revenue, increase our costs and adversely affect our relationship with affected customers and our reputation as a reliable supplier. We may be required to pay higher prices for raw materials or electronic components in short supply and order these raw materials or electronic components in greater quantities to compensate for variable delivery times. We may also be required to pay higher prices for raw materials or electronic components due to inflationary trends regardless of supply. We are also dependent on our suppliers' ability to supply and deliver raw materials on a timely basis at negotiated prices. Any delay or inability to deliver raw materials by our suppliers may require that we attempt to mitigate such failure or fail to make deliveries to our customers on a timely basis. As a result, raw material or electronic component shortages, price increases, or failure to perform by our suppliers could adversely affect our operating results for a particular period due to the resulting revenue shortfall and/or increased costs.Loss of our key management and other personnel, or an inability to attract key management and other personnel, could materially affect our business.We depend on our senior executive officers and other key personnel to run our business. We do not have long-term employment contracts with our key personnel. The loss of any of these officers or other key personnel could adversely affect our operations. Competition for qualified employees among companies that rely heavily on engineering and technology is at times intense, and the loss of qualified employees or an inability to attract, retain and motivate additional highly skilled employees required for the operation and expansion of our business could hinder our ability to conduct research activities and develop marketable products successfully.We are subject to a variety of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations that expose us to potential financial liability.Our operations are regulated by a number of federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health, and safety (“EHS”) laws and regulations that govern, among other things, air and water emissions, worker protection, and the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials. Compliance with EHS laws and regulations is a major consideration for us because we use hazardous materials in our manufacturing processes. If we violate EHS laws and regulations, we could be liable for substantial fines, penalties, and costs of mandated remedial actions. Our environmental permits could also be revoked or modified, which could require us to cease or limit production at one or more of our facilities, thereby materially adversely affecting our business, financial condition and operating results. EHS laws and regulations have generally become more stringent over time and could continue to do so, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with any violation, which also could materially affect our business, financial condition and operating results.We have been notified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, state environmental agencies and, in some cases, groups of potentially responsible parties, that we are potentially liable for environmental contamination at several sites currently and formerly owned or operated by us, including sites designated as National Priorities List sites under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Superfund program. Superfund liability is joint and several and we may be held responsible for more than our share of contamination at a site. Although we estimate our potential environmental liability and reserve for such matters, we cannot assure you that our reserves will be sufficient to cover the actual costs that we incur as a result of these matters.CTS CORPORATION 11Table of ContentsFuture events, such as the notification of potential liability at new sites, the discovery of additional contamination or changes to an approved remedy at existing sites, changes to existing EHS environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation, and more rigorous regulatory action by government authorities, may require additional expenditures by us, which could have a negative impact on our operations.In addition, we could be affected by future laws or regulations imposed in response to climate change concerns. Such laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Climate change initiatives may result in significant operational changes and expenditures, reduce demand for our products and adversely affect our business. We recognize that climate change is a global environmental concern. Continuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and pending international agreements and national, regional or local legislation and regulatory measures to limit greenhouse gas emissions. These agreements and measures may require equipment modifications, operational changes, taxes, or purchase of emission credits to reduce emission of greenhouse gases from our operations, which may result in substantial capital expenditures and compliance, operating, maintenance and remediation costs.  Regulatory initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas usage may also adversely impact some of the industries we serve and our supply chain, adversely impacting our sales and the value of our business.Our indebtedness may adversely affect our financial health.Our debt consists of borrowings under our revolving credit facility. Our indebtedness could, among other things: increase our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions, including recessions; require us to use cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and other expenses; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness; or limit our ability to borrow additional funds that may be needed to operate and expand our business. Moreover, an increase in interest rates could increase our interest expense.Our credit facility contains provisions that could materially restrict our business.Our revolving credit facility contains restrictions limiting our ability to: dispose of assets; incur certain additional debt; repay other debt or amend subordinated debt instruments; create liens on assets; make investments, loans or advances; make acquisitions or engage in mergers or consolidations; engage in certain transactions with our subsidiaries and affiliates; repurchase stock; or make dividend payments above a certain amount.The restrictions contained in our credit facility could limit our ability to plan for or react to changes in market conditions or meet capital needs or could otherwise restrict our activities or business plans. These restrictions could adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, make strategic acquisitions, fund investments or other capital needs or engage in other business activities that could be in our interest.Further, our ability to comply with our loan covenants may be affected by events beyond our control that could result in an event of default under our credit facility, or documents governing any other existing or future indebtedness. A default, if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of our indebtedness. In addition, our lenders could terminate their commitments to make further extensions of credit under our credit facility. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds to pay the accelerated indebtedness or that we will have the ability to refinance accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us, or at all.Regulations related to conflict minerals could adversely impact our business.The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo (""DRC"") and adjoining countries. As a result, the SEC adopted annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who may use conflict minerals mined from the DRC and adjoining countries in their products. There have been and will continue to be costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including diligence costs to determine the sources of minerals used in our products and other potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply to the extent necessary as a consequence of such verification activities. These rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products. As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering conflict-free minerals, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary conflict-free minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain conflict minerals or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all minerals used in our products through the procedures we may implement.CTS CORPORATION 12 Table of ContentsIneffective internal control over our financial reporting may harm our business.We are subject to the ongoing internal control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (""Sarbanes-Oxley""). Our controls necessary for continued compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley may not operate effectively or at all times and may result in a material weakness. The identification of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting could indicate a lack of proper controls to generate accurate financial statements. Further, the effectiveness of our internal controls may be impacted if we are unable to retain sufficient skilled finance and accounting personnel, especially in light of the increased demand for such personnel among publicly traded companies.Natural disasters may adversely impact our capability to supply product to our customers.Natural disasters, such as storms, flooding and associated power outages, occurring at any of our locations or supplier locations may lead to disruption of our manufacturing operations and supply chain, adversely impacting our capability to supply product to our customers. In the event of a natural disaster, it may not be possible for us to find an alternate manufacturing location for certain product lines, further impacting our capability to recover from such a disruption.We could face risks to our systems, networks and production including increased IT security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime.Increased global information technology security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and communications. While we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures - including employee training, comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems, and maintenance of backup and protective systems - our systems, networks and products remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats. Depending on their nature and scope, such threats could potentially lead to the compromising of confidential information and communications, improper use of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations. Additionally, any updates to or implementation of systems, including the selection and implementation of an ERP system, may cause delays or disruptions in our processes or production which could adversely affect our results.CTS CORPORATION 13Table of Contents"
11,CTS,CTS CORP,2019-02-22,">Item 1A.  Risk Factors
The following are certain risk factors that could affect our business, financial condition and operating results. These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other reports filed or furnished by us, because these factors could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those projected in any such forward-looking statements. Before you invest in us, you should know that making such an investment involves risks, including the risks described below. The risks that are highlighted below are not the only ones that we face. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be negatively affected.Because we currently derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers, any decrease in orders from these customers could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.We depend on a small number of customers for a large portion of our business, and changes in the level of our customers' orders have, in the past, had a significant impact on our results of operations. If a major customer significantly delays, reduces, or cancels the level of business it does with us, there could be an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Significant pricing and margin pressures exerted by a major customer could also materially adversely affect our operating results. In addition, we generate significant accounts receivable from sales to our major customers. If one or more of our major customers were to become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay or were to delay payment for our products, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.Negative or unexpected tax consequences could adversely affect our results of operations.We operate globally and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results.  The international tax environment continues to change as a result of both coordinated actions by governments and unilateral measures enacted by individual countries, such as the comprehensive tax reform enacted in the U.S. in 2017, which could significantly impact our effective tax rate, tax liabilities, and ability to utilize deferred tax assets.Adverse changes in the underlying profitability and financial outlook of our operations in several jurisdictions could lead to changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and other tax accruals that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.  In addition, acquisitions or divestitures may cause our effective tax rate to change.We base our tax accounting positions upon the anticipated nature and conduct of our business and upon our understanding of the tax laws of the various countries in which we have assets or conduct activities. However, our tax accounting positions are subject to review and possible challenge by taxing authorities and to possible changes in law, which may have a retroactive effect. We may be unable to compete effectively against competitors.The industries in which we operate are highly competitive and characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change. We compete against many domestic and foreign companies, some of which have substantially greater manufacturing, financial, research and development, and marketing resources than we do. If any customer becomes dissatisfied with our prices, quality, or timeliness of delivery, among other things, it could award business to our competitors. Moreover, some of our customers could choose to manufacture and develop particular products themselves rather than purchase them from us. Increased competition could result in price reductions, reduced profit margins and loss of market share, each of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. These developments also may materially adversely affect our ability to compete successfully going forward. We cannot assure you that our products will continue to compete successfully with our competitors' products, including OEMs.We may be unable to keep pace with rapid technological changes that could make some of our products or processes obsolete before we realize a return on our investment.The technologies relating to some of our products have undergone, and are continuing to undergo, rapid and significant changes.  End markets for our products are characterized by technological change, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, changes in customer requirements, and emerging industry standards. The introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable before we can recover any or all of our research, development and commercialization expenses, or our capital investments. Furthermore, the life cycles of our products and the products we manufacture for others vary, may change, and are difficult to estimate.We may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of new products or product enhancements and our new products or product enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of the CTS CORPORATION 7Table of Contentsmarketplace or achieve market acceptance. If we are unable, for technological or other reasons, to develop and market new products or product enhancements in a timely and cost-effective manner, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.Our customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities or locations or delay production.We generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers, and regularly experience reduced or extended lead times in customer orders. Customers cancel orders, change production quantities and delay production for a number of reasons. Uncertain economic and geopolitical conditions may result in some of our customers delaying the delivery of some of the products we manufacture for them and placing purchase orders for lower volumes of products than previously anticipated. Cancellations, reductions or delays by a significant customer or by a number of customers may harm our results of operations by reducing the volumes of products we manufacture and sell, as well as by causing a delay in the recovery of our expenditures for inventory in preparation for customer orders, or by reducing our asset utilization, resulting in lower profitability.In addition, customers may require that manufacturing of their products be transitioned from one of our facilities to another to achieve cost reductions and other objectives. Such transfers may result in inefficiencies and costs due to resulting excess capacity and overhead at one facility and capacity constraints and the inability to fulfill all orders at another.  In addition, we make key decisions based on our estimates of customer requirements, including determining the levels of orders that we will seek and accept, production schedules, component procurement commitments, personnel needs and other resource requirements. The short-term nature of our customers' commitments and the changes in demand for their products may reduce our ability to estimate future customer requirements accurately. This may make it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of our manufacturing capacity. Anticipated orders may not materialize and delivery schedules may be deferred as a result of changes in demand for our products or our customers' products. We often increase staffing and capacity, and incur other expenses to meet the anticipated demand of our customers, which causes reductions in our gross margins if customer orders are delayed or canceled. On occasion, customers require rapid increases in production, which may stress our resources and reduce margins. We may not have sufficient capacity at any given time to meet our customers' demands. In addition, because many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed over the short-term, a reduction in customer demand could harm our gross margin and operating income until such time as adjustments can be made to activity and operating levels or to structural costs.We sell products to customers in cyclical industries that are subject to significant downturns that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.We sell products to customers in cyclical industries that have experienced economic and industry downturns. The markets for our products have softened in the past and may again soften in the future. We may face reduced end-customer demand, underutilization of our manufacturing capacity, changes in our revenue mix and other factors that could adversely affect our results of operations in the near-term. We cannot predict whether we will achieve profitability in future periods.We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from customers in the transportation, information technology and telecommunications industries and are susceptible to trends and factors affecting those industries.Sales to the transportation, information technology and telecommunications industries represent a substantial portion of our revenues. Factors negatively affecting these industries and the demand for their products also negatively affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Any adverse occurrence, including among others, industry slowdown, recession, political instability, costly or constraining regulations, increased tariffs, reduced government budgets and spending, armed hostilities, terrorism, excessive inflation, prolonged disruptions in one or more of our customers' production schedules or labor disturbances, that results in a decline in the volume of sales in these industries, or in an overall downturn in the business and operations of our customers in these industries, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. These industries are generally unionized and some of our customers have experienced labor disruptions in the past. Furthermore, these industries are highly cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, consumer preferences and interest rates. The failure of manufacturers that we serve may result in the failure to receive payment in full for products sold in the past and an abrupt cancellation in demand for certain products. Weakness in demand, the insolvency of manufacturers that we serve or their suppliers, and constriction of credit markets may negatively and materially affect our facility utilization, cost structure, financial condition, and operating results.8 CTS CORPORATIONTable of ContentsProducts we manufacture may contain design or manufacturing defects that could result in reduced demand for our products or services and liability claims against us.Despite our quality control and quality assurance efforts, defects may occur in the products we manufacture due to design or manufacturing errors or component failure. Product defects could result in delayed shipments and reduced demand for our products. We may be subject to increased costs due to warranty claims on defective products. Product defects could result in product liability claims against us where defects cause, or are alleged to cause, property damage, bodily injury or death. As we grow our business in the transportation and medical device markets, the risk of exposure to product liability litigation increases. We may be required to participate in a recall involving products which are, or are alleged to be, defective. We carry insurance for certain legal matters involving product liability; however, we do not have coverage for all costs related to product defects and the costs of such claims, including costs of defense and settlement, may exceed our available coverage. Accordingly, our results of operations, cash flow and financial position could be adversely affected.We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.We transact business in various foreign countries. We present our consolidated financial statements in U.S. dollars, but a portion of our revenues and expenditures are transacted in other currencies. As a result, we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies.  Additionally, we have currency exposure arising from funds held in local currencies in foreign countries. Volatility in the exchange rates between the foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Furthermore, to the extent we sell our products in foreign markets, currency fluctuations may result in our products becoming too expensive for foreign customers.Our operating results vary significantly from period to period.We experience fluctuations in our operating results. Some of the principal factors that contribute to these fluctuations are: changes in demand for our products; our effectiveness in managing manufacturing processes, costs and timing of our component purchases so that components are available when needed for production, while mitigating the risks of purchasing inventory in excess of immediate production needs; the degree to which we are able to utilize our available manufacturing capacity; changes in the cost and availability of components, which often occur in the electronics manufacturing industry and which affect our margins and our ability to meet delivery schedules; general economic and served industry conditions; and local conditions and events that may affect our production volumes, such as labor conditions or political instability.We face risks relating to our international operations.Because we have significant international operations, our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by economic, political, health, regulatory and other factors existing in foreign countries in which we operate. Our international operations are subject to inherent risks, which may materially adversely affect us, including: political and economic instability in countries in which our products are manufactured; expropriation or the imposition of government controls; changes in government regulations; export license requirements; trade restrictions; earnings repatriation and expatriation restrictions; exposure to different legal standards, including related to intellectual property; health conditions and standards; currency controls; fluctuations in exchange rates; increases in the duties and taxes we pay; inflation or deflation; greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer payment cycles; changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing our international operations; limitations on insurance coverage against geopolitical risks, natural disasters, and business operations; and communication among and management of international operations. In addition, these same factors may also place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to some of our foreign competitors.We may face risks associated with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (""FCPA"") and similar anti-bribery laws. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our Code of Ethics mandates compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world where strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We cannot assure you that our internal controls and procedures always will protect us from the detrimental actions by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for FCPA violations (either due to our own acts or inadvertence or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.Public health or safety concerns, conditions, or restrictions that impact the availability of labor or the movement of goods in some of the countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.CTS CORPORATION 9Table of ContentsWe may restructure our operations or fail to execute capital projects as planned, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.We have announced and initiated restructuring plans or capital projects at various times in the recent past designed to revise and consolidate certain aspects of our operations for the purpose of improving our cost structure or manufacturing efficiency. We may incur restructuring and impairment charges in the future if circumstances warrant.  Additionally, if we are unsuccessful in implementing restructuring plans or in executing capital projects, we may experience disruptions in our operations and higher ongoing costs, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.Losses in the stock market could negatively impact pension asset returns and cash flow due to possible required contributions in the future.We make a number of assumptions relating to our pension plans in order to measure the financial position of the plans and the net periodic benefit cost. The most significant assumptions relate to the discount rate and the expected long-term return on plan assets. If these assumptions prove to be significantly different from actual rates, then we may need to record additional expense relating to the pension plans, which could require cash contributions to fund future pension obligation payments and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.We may pursue acquisition opportunities that complement or expand our business as well as divestitures that could impact our business operations. We may not be able to complete these transactions, and these transactions, if executed, may pose significant risks that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.On an ongoing basis we explore opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that could complement, enhance or expand our current business or product lines or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities. We may have difficulty finding suitable opportunities or, if we do identify these opportunities, we may not be able to complete the transactions for any number of reasons including a failure to secure financing. In addition, we may not be able to successfully or profitably integrate, operate, maintain and manage our newly acquired operations or employees. Any transactions that we are able to identify and complete may involve a number of risks, including: the diversion of management's attention from our existing business to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired or combined business; possible adverse effects on our operating results during the integration process; difficulties managing and integrating operations in geographically dispersed locations; increases in our expenses and working capital requirements, which could reduce our return on invested capital; exposure to unanticipated liabilities of acquired companies; and our possible inability to achieve the intended objectives of the transaction. Even if we are initially successful in integrating a new operation, we may not be able to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, and this may lead to operational inefficiencies. In addition, future acquisitions may result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of additional debt. These and other factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability from acquired operations or realize other anticipated benefits of an acquisition, and could adversely affect our business and operating results.We have in the past, and may in the future, consider divesting certain business operations. Divestitures may involve a number of risks, including the diversion of management's attention, significant costs and expenses, the loss of customer relationships and cash flow, and the disruption of operations in the affected business. Failure to timely complete or consummate a divestiture may negatively affect valuation of the affected business or result in restructuring charges.If we are unable to protect our intellectual property or we infringe, or are alleged to infringe, on others' intellectual property rights, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.The success of our business depends, in part, upon our ability to protect trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights and patents, obtain or license patents and operate without infringing on the intellectual property rights of others. We rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, patents, nondisclosure agreements and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights in our products and technology. The steps we have taken to prevent misappropriation of our technology may be inadequate. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which we operate do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Although we continue to evaluate and implement protective measures, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful. Our inability to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish or eliminate the competitive advantages that we derive from our technology, cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business.We believe that patents will continue to play an important role in our business. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in securing patents for claims in any pending patent application or that any issued patent will provide us with any 10 CTS CORPORATIONTable of Contentscompetitive advantage. We also cannot provide assurance that the patents will not be challenged by third parties or that the patents of others will not materially adversely affect our ability to do business.We may become involved in litigation in the future to protect our intellectual property or because others may allege that we infringed on their intellectual property. These claims and any resulting lawsuit could subject us to liability for damages and invalidate our intellectual property rights. If an infringement claim is successfully asserted by a holder of intellectual property rights, we may be required to cease marketing or selling certain products, pay penalties and spend significant time and money to develop a non-infringing product or process or to obtain licenses for the technology, process or information from the holder. We may not be successful in the development of a non-infringing alternative, or licenses may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, in which case we may lose sales and profits. In addition, any litigation could be lengthy and costly and could materially adversely affect us even if we are successful in the litigation.We may experience shortages and increased costs of raw material and required electronic components.Unanticipated raw material or electronic component shortages may prevent us from making scheduled shipments to customers. Our inability to make scheduled shipments could cause us to experience a shortfall in revenue, increase our costs and adversely affect our relationship with affected customers and our reputation as a reliable supplier. We may be required to pay higher prices for raw materials or electronic components in short supply and order these raw materials or electronic components in greater quantities to compensate for variable delivery times. We may also be required to pay higher prices for raw materials or electronic components due to inflationary trends regardless of supply.  We are also dependent on our suppliers' ability to supply and deliver raw materials on a timely basis at negotiated prices.  Any delay or inability to deliver raw materials by our suppliers may require that we attempt to mitigate such failure or fail to make deliveries to our customers on a timely basis. As a result, raw material or electronic component shortages, price increases, or failure to perform by our suppliers could adversely affect our operating results for a particular period due to the resulting revenue shortfall and/or increased costs.Loss of our key management and other personnel, or an inability to attract key management and other personnel, could materially affect our business.We depend on our senior executive officers and other key personnel to run our business. We do not have long-term employment contracts with our key personnel. The loss of any of these officers or other key personnel could adversely affect our operations. Competition for qualified employees among companies that rely heavily on engineering and technology is at times intense, and the loss of qualified employees or an inability to attract, retain and motivate additional highly skilled employees required for the operation and expansion of our business could hinder our ability to conduct research activities and develop marketable products successfully.We are subject to a variety of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations that expose us to potential financial liability.Our operations are regulated by a number of federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health, and safety (“EHS”) laws and regulations that govern, among other things, air and water emissions, worker protection, and the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials. Compliance with EHS laws and regulations is a major consideration for us because we use hazardous materials in our manufacturing processes. If we violate EHS laws and regulations, we could be liable for substantial fines, penalties, and costs of mandated remedial actions. Our environmental permits could also be revoked or modified, which could require us to cease or limit production at one or more of our facilities, thereby materially adversely affecting our business, financial condition and operating results. EHS laws and regulations have generally become more stringent over time and could continue to do so, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with any violation, which also could materially affect our business, financial condition and operating results.We have been notified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, state environmental agencies and, in some cases, groups of potentially responsible parties, that we are potentially liable for environmental contamination at several sites currently and formerly owned or operated by us, including sites designated as National Priorities List sites under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Superfund program. Superfund liability is joint and several and we may be held responsible for more than our share of contamination at a site.  Although we estimate our potential environmental liability and reserve for such matters, we cannot assure you that our reserves will be sufficient to cover the actual costs that we incur as a result of these matters.Future events, such as the notification of potential liability at new sites, the discovery of additional contamination or changes to an approved remedy at existing sites, changes to existing EHS environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation, and more CTS CORPORATION 11Table of Contentsrigorous regulatory action by government authorities, may require additional expenditures by us, which could have a negative impact on our operations.In addition, we could be affected by future laws or regulations imposed in response to climate change concerns. Such laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our indebtedness may adversely affect our financial health.Our debt consists of borrowings under our revolving credit facility.  Our indebtedness could, among other things: increase our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions, including recessions; require us to use cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and other expenses; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness; or limit our ability to borrow additional funds that may be needed to operate and expand our business. Moreover, an increase in interest rates could increase our interest expense.Our credit facility contains provisions that could materially restrict our business.Our revolving credit facility contains restrictions limiting our ability to: dispose of assets; incur certain additional debt; repay other debt or amend subordinated debt instruments; create liens on assets; make investments, loans or advances; make acquisitions or engage in mergers or consolidations; engage in certain transactions with our subsidiaries and affiliates; repurchase stock; or make dividend payments above a certain amount.The restrictions contained in our credit facility could limit our ability to plan for or react to changes in market conditions or meet capital needs or could otherwise restrict our activities or business plans. These restrictions could adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, make strategic acquisitions, fund investments or other capital needs or engage in other business activities that could be in our interest.Further, our ability to comply with our loan covenants may be affected by events beyond our control that could result in an event of default under our credit facility, or documents governing any other existing or future indebtedness. A default, if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of our indebtedness. In addition, our lenders could terminate their commitments to make further extensions of credit under our credit facility. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds to pay the accelerated indebtedness or that we will have the ability to refinance accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us, or at all.Regulations related to conflict minerals could adversely impact our business.The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo (""DRC"") and adjoining countries. As a result, the SEC adopted annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who may use conflict minerals mined from the DRC and adjoining countries in their products. There have been and will continue to be costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including diligence costs to determine the sources of minerals used in our products and other potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply to the extent necessary as a consequence of such verification activities. These rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products. As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering conflict-free minerals, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary conflict-free minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain conflict minerals or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all minerals used in our products through the procedures we may implement.Ineffective internal control over our financial reporting may harm our business.We are subject to the ongoing internal control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (""Sarbanes-Oxley""). Our controls necessary for continued compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley may not operate effectively or at all times and may result in a material weakness. The identification of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting could indicate a lack of proper controls to generate accurate financial statements. Further, the effectiveness of our internal controls may be impacted if we are unable to retain sufficient skilled finance and accounting personnel, especially in light of the increased demand for such personnel among publicly traded companies.12 CTS CORPORATIONTable of ContentsNatural disasters may adversely impact our capability to supply product to our customers.Natural disasters, such as storms, flooding and associated power outages, occurring at any of our locations or supplier locations may lead to disruption of our manufacturing operations and supply chain, adversely impacting our capability to supply product to our customers. In the event of a natural disaster, it may not be possible for us to find an alternate manufacturing location for certain product lines, further impacting our capability to recover from such a disruption.We could face risks to our systems, networks and production including increased IT security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime.Increased global information technology security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and communications. While we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures - including employee training, comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems, and maintenance of backup and protective systems - our systems, networks and products remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats. Depending on their nature and scope, such threats could potentially lead to the compromising of confidential information and communications, improper use of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations.  Additionally, any updates to or implementation of systems, including the selection and implementation of an ERP system, may cause delays or disruptions in our processes or production which could adversely affect our results.CTS CORPORATION 13Table of Contents"
7,CTS,CTS CORP,2018-02-23,">Item 1A.  Risk Factors
The following are certain risk factors that could affect our business, financial condition and operating results. These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other reports filed or furnished by us, because these factors could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those projected in any such forward-looking statements. Before you invest in us, you should know that making such an investment involves risks, including the risks described below. The risks that are highlighted below are not the only ones that we face. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be negatively affected.Because we currently derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers, any decrease in orders from these customers could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.We depend on a small number of customers for a large portion of our business, and changes in the level of our customers' orders have, in the past, had a significant impact on our results of operations. If a major customer significantly delays, reduces, or cancels the level of business it does with us, there could be an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Significant pricing and margin pressures exerted by a major customer could also materially adversely affect our operating results. In addition, we generate significant accounts receivable from sales to our major customers. If one or more of our major customers were to become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay or were to delay payment for our products, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.Negative or unexpected tax consequences could adversely affect our results of operations.We operate globally and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results.  The international tax environment continues to change as a result of both coordinated actions by governments and unilateral measures enacted by individual countries, such as the comprehensive tax reform enacted in the U.S. at the end of 2017.  Although the Company continues to evaluate the impact of the recent U.S. tax reform, it could significantly impact our effective tax rate, tax liabilities and our ability to utilize deferred tax assets.Adverse changes in the underlying profitability and financial outlook of our operations in several jurisdictions could lead to changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and other tax accruals that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.  In addition, acquisitions or divestitures may cause our effective tax rate to change.We base our tax accounting positions upon the anticipated nature and conduct of our business and upon our understanding of the tax laws of the various countries in which we have assets or conduct activities. However, our tax accounting positions are subject to review and possible challenge by taxing authorities and to possible changes in law, which may have a retroactive effect. We may be unable to compete effectively against competitors.The industries in which we operate are highly competitive and characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change. We compete against many domestic and foreign companies, some of which have substantially greater manufacturing, financial, research and development and marketing resources than we do. If any customer becomes dissatisfied with our prices, quality or timeliness of delivery, among other things, it could award business to our competitors. Moreover, some of our customers could choose to manufacture and develop particular products themselves rather than purchase them from us. Increased competition could result in price reductions, reduced profit margins and loss of market share, each of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. These developments also may materially adversely affect our ability to compete successfully going forward. We cannot assure you that our products will continue to compete successfully with our competitors' products, including OEMs.We may be unable to keep pace with rapid technological changes that could make some of our products or processes obsolete before we realize a return on our investment.The technologies relating to some of our products have undergone, and are continuing to undergo, rapid and significant changes.  End markets for our products are characterized by technological change, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, changes in customer requirements, and emerging industry standards. The introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable before we can recover any or all of our research, development and commercialization expenses, or our capital investments. Furthermore, the life cycles of our products and the products we manufacture for others vary, may change, and are difficult to estimate.CTS CORPORATION 7Table of ContentsWe may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of new products or product enhancements and our new products or product enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance. If we are unable, for technological or other reasons, to develop and market new products or product enhancements in a timely and cost-effective manner, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.Our customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities or locations or delay production.We generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers, and regularly experience reduced or extended lead times in customer orders. Customers cancel orders, change production quantities and delay production for a number of reasons. Uncertain economic and geopolitical conditions may result in some of our customers delaying the delivery of some of the products we manufacture for them and placing purchase orders for lower volumes of products than previously anticipated. Cancellations, reductions or delays by a significant customer or by a number of customers may harm our results of operations by reducing the volumes of products we manufacture and sell, as well as by causing a delay in the recovery of our expenditures for inventory in preparation for customer orders, or by reducing our asset utilization, resulting in lower profitability.In addition, customers may require that manufacturing of their products be transitioned from one of our facilities to another to achieve cost reductions and other objectives. Such transfers may result in inefficiencies and costs due to resulting excess capacity and overhead at one facility and capacity constraints and the inability to fulfill all orders at another. In addition, we make key decisions based on our estimates of customer requirements, including determining the levels of orders that we will seek and accept, production schedules, component procurement commitments, personnel needs and other resource requirements. The short-term nature of our customers' commitments and the changes in demand for their products may reduce our ability to estimate future customer requirements accurately. This may make it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of our manufacturing capacity. Anticipated orders may not materialize and delivery schedules may be deferred as a result of changes in demand for our products or our customers' products. We often increase staffing and capacity, and incur other expenses to meet the anticipated demand of our customers, which causes reductions in our gross margins if customer orders are delayed or canceled. On occasion, customers require rapid increases in production, which may stress our resources and reduce margins. We may not have sufficient capacity at any given time to meet our customers' demands. In addition, because many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed over the short-term, a reduction in customer demand could harm our gross margin and operating income until such time as adjustments can be made to activity and operating levels or to structural costs.We sell products to customers in cyclical industries that are subject to significant downturns that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.We sell products to customers in cyclical industries that have experienced economic and industry downturns. The markets for our products have softened in the past and may again soften in the future. We may face reduced end-customer demand, underutilization of our manufacturing capacity, changes in our revenue mix and other factors that could adversely affect our results of operations in the near-term. We cannot predict whether we will achieve profitability in future periods.We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from customers in the transportation, information technology and communications industries and are susceptible to trends and factors affecting those industries.Sales to the transportation, information technology and communications industries represent a substantial portion of our revenues. Factors negatively affecting these industries and the demand for their products also negatively affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Any adverse occurrence, including among others, industry slowdown, recession, political instability, costly or constraining regulations, reduced government budgets and spending, armed hostilities, terrorism, excessive inflation, prolonged disruptions in one or more of our customers' production schedules or labor disturbances, that results in a decline in the volume of sales in these industries, or in an overall downturn in the business and operations of our customers in these industries, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. These industries are generally unionized and some of our customers have experienced labor disruptions in the past. Furthermore, these industries are highly cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, consumer preferences and interest rates. The failure of manufacturers that we serve may result in the failure to receive payment in full for products sold in the past and an abrupt cancellation in demand for certain products. Weakness in demand, the insolvency of manufacturers that we serve or their suppliers, and constriction of credit markets may negatively and materially affect our facility utilization, cost structure, financial condition, and operating results.8 CTS CORPORATIONTable of ContentsProducts we manufacture may contain design or manufacturing defects that could result in reduced demand for our products or services and liability claims against us.Despite our quality control and quality assurance efforts, defects may occur in the products we manufacture due to design or manufacturing errors or component failure. Product defects could result in delayed shipments and reduced demand for our products. We may be subject to increased costs due to warranty claims on defective products. Product defects could result in product liability claims against us where defects cause, or are alleged to cause, property damage, bodily injury or death. As we grow our business in the transportation and medical device markets, the risk of exposure to product liability litigation increases. We may be required to participate in a recall involving products which are, or are alleged to be, defective. We carry insurance for certain legal matters involving product liability; however, we do not have coverage for all costs related to product defects and the costs of such claims, including costs of defense and settlement, may exceed our available coverage. Accordingly, our results of operations, cash flow and financial position could be adversely affected.We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.We transact business in various foreign countries. We present our consolidated financial statements in U.S. dollars, but a portion of our revenues and expenditures are transacted in other currencies. As a result, we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies.  Additionally, we have currency exposure arising from funds held in local currencies in foreign countries. Volatility in the exchange rates between the foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Furthermore, to the extent we sell our products in foreign markets, currency fluctuations may result in our products becoming too expensive for foreign customers.Our operating results vary significantly from period to period.We experience fluctuations in our operating results. Some of the principal factors that contribute to these fluctuations are: changes in demand for our products; our effectiveness in managing manufacturing processes, costs and timing of our component purchases so that components are available when needed for production, while mitigating the risks of purchasing inventory in excess of immediate production needs; the degree to which we are able to utilize our available manufacturing capacity; changes in the cost and availability of components, which often occur in the electronics manufacturing industry and which affect our margins and our ability to meet delivery schedules; general economic and served industry conditions; and local conditions and events that may affect our production volumes, such as labor conditions or political instability.We face risks relating to our international operations.Because we have significant international operations, our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by economic, political, health, regulatory and other factors existing in foreign countries in which we operate. Our international operations are subject to inherent risks, which may materially adversely affect us, including: political and economic instability in countries in which our products are manufactured; expropriation or the imposition of government controls; changes in government regulations; export license requirements; trade restrictions; earnings repatriation and expatriation restrictions; exposure to different legal standards, including related to intellectual property; health conditions and standards; currency controls; fluctuations in exchange rates; increases in the duties and taxes we pay; inflation or deflation; greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer payment cycles; changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing our international operations; limitations on insurance coverage against geopolitical risks, natural disasters and business operations; and communication among and management of international operations. In addition, these same factors may also place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to some of our foreign competitors.We may face risks associated with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (""FCPA"") and similar  anti-bribery laws. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our Code of Ethics mandates compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world where strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We cannot assure you that our internal controls and procedures always will protect us from the detrimental actions by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for FCPA violations (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.Public health or safety concerns, conditions, or restrictions that impact the availability of labor or the movement of goods  in some of the countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.CTS CORPORATION 9Table of ContentsWe may restructure our operations, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.We have announced and initiated restructuring plans at various times in the recent past designed to revise and consolidate certain aspects of our operations for the purpose of improving our cost structure. We may incur restructuring and impairment charges in the future if circumstances warrant.  Additionally, if we are unsuccessful in implementing restructuring plans, we may experience disruptions in our operations and higher ongoing costs, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.Losses in the stock market could negatively impact pension asset returns and cash flow due to possible required contributions in the future.We make a number of assumptions relating to our pension plans in order to measure the financial position of the plans and the net periodic benefit cost. The most significant assumptions relate to the discount rate and the expected long-term return on plan assets. If these assumptions prove to be significantly different from actual rates, then we may need to record additional expense relating to the pension plans, which could require cash contributions to fund future pension obligation payments and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.We may pursue acquisition opportunities that complement or expand our business as well as divestitures that could impact our business operations. We may not be able to complete these transactions, and these transactions, if executed, may pose significant risks that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.On an ongoing basis we explore opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that could complement, enhance or expand our current business or product lines or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities. We may have difficulty finding suitable opportunities or, if we do identify these opportunities, we may not be able to complete the transactions for any number of reasons including a failure to secure financing. In addition, we may not be able to successfully or profitably integrate, operate, maintain and manage our newly acquired operations or employees. Any transactions that we are able to identify and complete may involve a number of risks, including: the diversion of management's attention from our existing business to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired or combined business; possible adverse effects on our operating results during the integration process; difficulties managing and integrating operations in geographically dispersed locations; increases in our expenses and working capital requirements, which could reduce our return on invested capital; exposure to unanticipated liabilities of acquired companies; and our possible inability to achieve the intended objectives of the transaction. Even if we are initially successful in integrating a new operation, we may not be able to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, and this may lead to operational inefficiencies. In addition, future acquisitions may result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of additional debt. These and other factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability from acquired operations or realize other anticipated benefits of an acquisition, and could adversely affect our business and operating results.We have in the past, and may in the future, consider divesting certain business operations. Divestitures may involve a number of risks, including the diversion of management's attention, significant costs and expenses, the loss of customer relationships and cash flow, and the disruption of operations in the affected business. Failure to timely complete or consummate a divestiture may negatively affect valuation of the affected business or result in restructuring charges.If we are unable to protect our intellectual property or we infringe, or are alleged to infringe, on others' intellectual property rights, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.The success of our business depends, in part, upon our ability to protect trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights and patents, obtain or license patents and operate without infringing on the intellectual property rights of others. We rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, patents, nondisclosure agreements and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights in our products and technology. The steps we have taken to prevent misappropriation of our technology may be inadequate. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which we operate do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Although we continue to evaluate and implement protective measures, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful. Our inability to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish or eliminate the competitive advantages that we derive from our technology, cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business.We believe that patents will continue to play an important role in our business. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in securing patents for claims in any pending patent application or that any issued patent will provide us with any 10 CTS CORPORATIONTable of Contentscompetitive advantage. We also cannot provide assurance that the patents will not be challenged by third parties or that the patents of others will not materially adversely affect our ability to do business.We may become involved in litigation in the future to protect our intellectual property or because others may allege that we infringed on their intellectual property. These claims and any resulting lawsuit could subject us to liability for damages and invalidate our intellectual property rights. If an infringement claim is successfully asserted by a holder of intellectual property rights, we may be required to cease marketing or selling certain products, pay penalties and spend significant time and money to develop a non-infringing product or process or to obtain licenses for the technology, process or information from the holder. We may not be successful in the development of a non-infringing alternative, or licenses may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, in which case we may lose sales and profits. In addition, any litigation could be lengthy and costly and could materially adversely affect us even if we are successful in the litigation.We may experience shortages and increased costs of raw material and required electronic components.Unanticipated raw material or electronic component shortages may prevent us from making scheduled shipments to customers. Our inability to make scheduled shipments could cause us to experience a shortfall in revenue, increase our costs and adversely affect our relationship with affected customers and our reputation as a reliable supplier. We may be required to pay higher prices for raw materials or electronic components in short supply and order these raw materials or electronic components in greater quantities to compensate for variable delivery times. We may also be required to pay higher prices for raw materials or electronic components due to inflationary trends regardless of supply.  We are also dependent on our suppliers' ability to supply and deliver raw materials on a timely basis at negotiated prices.  Any delay or inability to deliver raw materials by our suppliers may require that we attempt to mitigate such failure or fail to make deliveries to our customers on a timely basis. As a result, raw material or electronic component shortages, price increases, or failure to perform by our suppliers could adversely affect our operating results for a particular period due to the resulting revenue shortfall and/or increased costs.Loss of our key management and other personnel, or an inability to attract key management and other personnel, could materially affect our business.We depend on our senior executive officers and other key personnel to run our business. We do not have long-term employment contracts with our key personnel. The loss of any of these officers or other key personnel could adversely affect our operations. Competition for qualified employees among companies that rely heavily on engineering and technology is at times intense, and the loss of qualified employees or an inability to attract, retain and motivate additional highly skilled employees required for the operation and expansion of our business could hinder our ability to conduct research activities and develop marketable products successfully.We are subject to a variety of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations that expose us to potential financial liability.Our operations are regulated by a number of federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health, and safety (“EHS”) laws and regulations that govern, among other things, air and water emissions, worker protection, and the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials. Compliance with EHS laws and regulations is a major consideration for us because we use hazardous materials in our manufacturing processes.

EHS laws and regulations have generally become more stringent over time and could continue to do so, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with any violation, which also could materially affect our business, financial condition and operating results.We have been notified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, state environmental agencies and, in some cases, groups of potentially responsible parties, that we are potentially liable for environmental contamination at several sites currently and formerly owned or operated by us, including sites designated as National Priorities List sites under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Superfund program. Superfund liability is joint and several and we may be held responsible for more than our share of contamination at a site.  Although we estimate our potential environmental liability and reserve for such matters, we cannot assure you that our reserves will be sufficient to cover the actual costs that we incur as a result of these matters.Future events, such as the notification of potential liability at new sites, the discovery of additional contamination or changes to an approved remedy at existing sites, changes to existing EHS environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation, and more CTS CORPORATION 11Table of Contentsrigorous regulatory action by government authorities, may require additional expenditures by us, which could have a negative impact on our operations.In addition, we could be affected by future laws or regulations imposed in response to climate change concerns. Such laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our indebtedness may adversely affect our financial health.Our debt consists of borrowings under our revolving credit facility.  Our indebtedness could, among other things: increase our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions, including recessions; require us to use cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and other expenses; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness; or limit our ability to borrow additional funds that may be needed to operate and expand our business. Moreover, an increase in interest rates could increase our interest expense.Our credit facility contains provisions that could materially restrict our business.Our revolving credit facility contains restrictions limiting our ability to: dispose of assets; incur certain additional debt; repay other debt or amend subordinated debt instruments; create liens on assets; make investments, loans or advances; make acquisitions or engage in mergers or consolidations; engage in certain transactions with our subsidiaries and affiliates; and repurchases stock or make dividend payments above a certain amount.The restrictions contained in our credit facility could limit our ability to plan for or react to changes in market conditions or meet capital needs or could otherwise restrict our activities or business plans. These restrictions could adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, make strategic acquisitions, fund investments or other capital needs or engage in other business activities that could be in our interest.Further, our ability to comply with our loan covenants may be affected by events beyond our control that could result in an event of default under our credit facility, or documents governing any other existing or future indebtedness. A default, if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of our indebtedness. In addition, our lenders could terminate their commitments to make further extensions of credit under our credit facility. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds to pay the accelerated indebtedness or that we will have the ability to refinance accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all.Regulations related to conflict minerals could adversely impact our business.The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo (""DRC"") and adjoining countries. As a result, the SEC adopted annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who may use conflict minerals mined from the DRC and adjoining countries in their products. There have been and will continue to be costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including diligence costs to determine the sources of minerals used in our products and other potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply to the extent necessary as a consequence of such verification activities. These rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products. As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering conflict-free minerals, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary conflict-free minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain conflict minerals or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all minerals used in our products through the procedures we may implement.Ineffective internal control over our financial reporting may harm our business.We are subject to the ongoing internal control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (""Sarbanes-Oxley""). Our controls necessary for continued compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley may not operate effectively or at all times and may result in a material weakness. The identification of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting could indicate a lack of proper controls to generate accurate financial statements.

2,CTS,CTS CORP,2017-02-24,">Item 1A.  Risk Factors
The following are certain risk factors that could affect our business, financial condition and operating results. These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other reports filed or furnished by us, because these factors could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those projected in any such forward-looking statements. Before you invest in us, you should know that making such an investment involves risks, including the risks described below. The risks that are highlighted below are not the only ones that we face. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be negatively affected.Because we currently derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers, any decrease in orders from these customers could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.We depend on a small number of customers for a large portion of our business, and changes in the level of our customers' orders have, in the past, had a significant impact on our results of operations. If a major customer significantly delays, reduces, or cancels the level of business it does with us, there could be an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results, this effect would likely be material. Significant pricing and margin pressures exerted by a major customer could also materially adversely affect our operating results. In addition, we generate significant accounts receivable from sales to our major customers. If one or more of our major customers were to become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay or were to delay payment for services, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.Negative or unexpected tax consequences could adversely affect our results of operations.We operate globally and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our results.  The international tax environment continues to change as a result of both coordinated actions by governments and unilateral measures enacted by individual countries.  Additionally, comprehensive tax reform may occur in the U.S.  Both could significantly impact our effective tax rate, tax liabilities and our ability to utilize deferred tax assets.Adverse changes in the underlying profitability and financial outlook of our operations in several jurisdictions could lead to changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and other tax accruals that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.  In addition, acquisitions or divestitures may cause our effective tax rate to increase.We base our tax accounting positions upon the anticipated nature and conduct of our business and upon our understanding of the tax laws of the various countries in which we have assets or conduct activities. However, our tax accounting positions are subject to review and possible challenge by taxing authorities and to possible changes in law, which may have a retroactive effect. We may be unable to compete effectively against competitors.Our industry is highly competitive and characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change. We compete against many domestic and foreign companies, some of which have substantially greater manufacturing, financial, research and development and marketing resources than we do. If any customer becomes dissatisfied with our prices, quality or timeliness of delivery, among other things, it could award business to our competitors. Moreover, some of our customers could choose to manufacture and develop particular products themselves rather than purchase them from us. Increased competition could result in price reductions, reduced profit margins and loss of market share, each of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. These developments also may materially adversely affect our ability to compete successfully going forward. We cannot assure you that our products will continue to compete successfully with our competitors' products, including OEMs.We may be unable to keep pace with rapid technological changes that could make some of our products or processes obsolete before we realize a return on our investment.The technologies relating to some of our products have undergone, and are continuing to undergo, rapid and significant changes.  End markets for our products are characterized by technological change, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, changes in customer requirements, and emerging industry standards. The introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable before we can recover any or all of our research, development and commercialization expenses, or our capital investments. Furthermore, the life cycles of our products and the products we manufacture for others vary, may change, and are difficult to estimate.We may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of new products or product enhancements and our new products or product enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance. If we are unable, for technological or other reasons, to develop and market new products CTS CORPORATION 7Table of Contentsor product enhancements in a timely and cost-effective manner, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.Our customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities or locations or delay production.We generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers, and regularly experience reduced or extended lead times in customer orders. Customers cancel orders, change production quantities and delay production for a number of reasons. Uncertain economic and geopolitical conditions may result in some of our customers delaying the delivery of some of the products we manufacture for them and placing purchase orders for lower volumes of products than previously anticipated. Cancellations, reductions or delays by a significant customer or by a number of customers may harm our results of operations by reducing the volumes of products we manufacture, as well as by causing a delay in the recovery of our expenditures for inventory in preparation for customer orders, or by reducing our asset utilization, resulting in lower profitability.In addition, customers may require that manufacturing of their products be transitioned from one of our facilities to another to achieve cost reductions and other objectives. Such transfers may result in inefficiencies and costs due to resulting excess capacity and overhead at one facility and capacity constraints and the inability to fulfill all orders at another. In addition, we make significant decisions, including determining the levels of orders that we will seek and accept, production schedules, component procurement commitments, personnel needs and other resource requirements, based on our estimates of customer requirements. The short-term nature of our customers' commitments and the changes in demand for their products may reduce our ability to estimate future customer requirements accurately. This may make it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of our manufacturing capacity. Anticipated orders may not materialize and delivery schedules may be deferred as a result of changes in demand for our products or our customers' products. We often increase staffing and capacity, and incur other expenses to meet the anticipated demand of our customers, which causes reductions in our gross margins if customer orders are delayed or canceled. On occasion, customers require rapid increases in production, which may stress our resources and reduce margins. We may not have sufficient capacity at any given time to meet our customers' demands. In addition, because many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed over the short-term, a reduction in customer demand could harm our gross margin and operating income until such time as adjustments can be made to activity and operating levels or to structural costs.We sell products to customers in cyclical industries that are subject to significant downturns that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.We sell products to customers in cyclical industries that have experienced economic and industry downturns. The markets for our products have softened in the past and may again soften in the future. We may face reduced end-customer demand, underutilization of our manufacturing capacity, changes in our revenue mix and other factors that could adversely affect our results of operations in the near-term. We cannot predict whether we will achieve profitability in future periods.We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from customers in the automotive, computer and communications industries and are susceptible to trends and factors affecting those industries.Sales to the automotive, computer and communications industries represent a substantial portion of our revenues. Factors negatively affecting these industries and the demand for their products also negatively affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Any adverse occurrence, including among others, industry slowdown, recession, political instability, costly or constraining regulations, reduced government budgets and spending, armed hostilities, terrorism, excessive inflation, prolonged disruptions in one or more of our customers' production schedules or labor disturbances, that results in a decline in the volume of sales in these industries, or in an overall downturn in the business and operations of our customers in these industries, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. These industries are generally unionized and some of our customers have experienced labor disruptions in the past. Furthermore, these industries are highly cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, consumer preferences and interest rates. The failure of manufacturers that we serve may result in the failure to receive payment in full for products sold in the past and an abrupt cancellation in demand for certain products. Weakness in demand, the insolvency of manufacturers that we serve or their suppliers, and constriction of credit markets may negatively and materially affect our facility utilization, cost structure, financial condition, and operating results.Products we manufacture may contain design or manufacturing defects that could result in reduced demand for our products or services and liability claims against us.Despite our quality control and quality assurance efforts, defects may occur in the products we manufacture due to design or manufacturing errors or component failure. Product defects could result in delayed shipments and reduced demand for our products. We may be subject to increased costs due to warranty claims on defective products. Product defects could result in product liability 8 CTS CORPORATIONTable of Contentsclaims against us where defects cause, or are alleged to cause, property damage, bodily injury or death. As we grow our business in the automotive and medical device manufacturing markets, the risk of exposure to product liability litigation increases. We may be required to participate in a recall involving products which are, or are alleged to be, defective. We carry insurance for certain legal matters involving product liability; however, we do not have coverage for all costs related to product defects and the costs of such claims, including costs of defense and settlement, may exceed our available coverage. Accordingly, our results of operations, cash flow and financial position could be adversely affected.We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.We transact business in various foreign countries. We present our consolidated financial statements in U.S. dollars, but a portion of our revenues and expenditures are transacted in other currencies. As a result, we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies.  Additionally, we have currency exposure arising from funds held in local currencies in foreign countries. Volatility in the exchange rates between the foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Furthermore, to the extent we sell our products in foreign markets, currency fluctuations may result in our products becoming too expensive for foreign customers.Our operating results vary significantly from period to period.We experience fluctuations in our operating results. Some of the principal factors that contribute to these fluctuations are: changes in demand for our products; our effectiveness in managing manufacturing processes, costs and timing of our component purchases so that components are available when needed for production, while mitigating the risks of purchasing inventory in excess of immediate production needs; the degree to which we are able to utilize our available manufacturing capacity; changes in the cost and availability of components, which often occur in the electronics manufacturing industry and which affect our margins and our ability to meet delivery schedules; general economic and served industry conditions; and local conditions and events that may affect our production volumes, such as labor conditions or political instability.We face risks relating to our international operations.Because we have significant international operations, our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by economic, political, health, regulatory and other factors existing in foreign countries in which we operate. Our international operations are subject to inherent risks, which may materially adversely affect us, including: political and economic instability in countries in which our products are manufactured; expropriation or the imposition of government controls; changes in government regulations; export license requirements; trade restrictions; earnings repatriation and expatriation restrictions; exposure to different legal standards, including related to intellectual property; health conditions and standards; currency controls; fluctuations in exchange rates; increases in the duties and taxes we pay; inflation or deflation; greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer payment cycles; changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing our international operations; limitations on insurance coverage against geopolitical risks, natural disasters and business operations; and communication among and management of international operations. In addition, these same factors may also place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to some of our foreign competitors.We may face risks associated with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (""FCPA"") and similar  anti-bribery laws. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our Code of Ethics mandates compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world where strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We cannot assure you that our internal controls and procedures always will protect us from the detrimental actions by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for FCPA violations (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.Public health or safety concerns, conditions, or restrictions that impact the availability of labor or the movement of goods  in some of the countries in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.We may restructure our operations, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.We have announced and initiated restructuring plans designed to revise and consolidate certain operations for the purpose of improving our cost structure at various times in the recent past. We may incur restructuring and impairment charges in the future CTS CORPORATION 9Table of Contentsif circumstances warrant.  Additionally, if we are unsuccessful in implementing restructuring plans, we may experience disruptions in our operations and higher ongoing costs, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.Losses in the stock market could negatively impact pension asset returns and ultimately cash flow due to possible required contributions in the future.We make a number of assumptions relating to our pension plans in order to measure the financial position of the plans and the net periodic benefit cost. The most significant assumptions relate to the discount rate and the expected long-term return on plan assets. If these assumptions prove to be significantly different from actual rates, then we may need to record additional expense relating to the pension plans, which could require cash contributions to fund future pension obligation payments and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.We may explore acquisitions that complement or expand our business as well as divestitures of various business operations. We may not be able to complete these transactions, and these transactions, if executed, may pose significant risks and may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.We intend to explore opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that could complement, enhance or expand our current business or product lines or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities. We may have difficulty finding these opportunities or, if we do identify these opportunities, we may not be able to complete the transactions for any number of reasons including a failure to secure financing. In addition, we may not be able to successfully or profitably integrate, operate, maintain and manage our newly acquired operations or employees. Any transactions that we are able to identify and complete may involve a number of risks, including: the diversion of management's attention from our existing business to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired or combined business; possible adverse effects on our operating results during the integration process; difficulties managing and integrating operations in geographically dispersed locations; increases in our expenses and working capital requirements, which reduce our return on invested capital; exposure to unanticipated liabilities of acquired companies; and our possible inability to achieve the intended objectives of the transaction. Even if we are initially successful in integrating a new operation, we may not be able to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, and this may lead to operational inefficiencies. In addition, future acquisitions may result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of additional debt. These and other factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability from acquired operations or realize other anticipated benefits of an acquisition, and could adversely affect our business and operating results.We have in the past, and may in the future, consider divesting certain business operations. Divestitures may involve a number of risks, including the diversion of management's attention, significant costs and expenses, the loss of customer relationships and cash flow, and the disruption of operations in the affected business. Failure to timely complete or consummate a divestiture may negatively affect valuation of the affected business or result in restructuring charges.If we are unable to protect our intellectual property or we infringe, or are alleged to infringe, on another person's intellectual property, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.The success of our business depends, in part, upon our ability to protect trade secrets, copyrights and patents, obtain or license patents and operate without infringing on the intellectual property rights of others. We rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, patents, nondisclosure agreements and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights in our products and technology. The steps we have taken to prevent misappropriation of our technology may be inadequate. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which we operate do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Although we continue to evaluate and implement protective measures, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful. Our inability to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish or eliminate the competitive advantages that we derive from our technology, cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business.We believe that patents will continue to play an important role in our business. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in securing patents for claims in any pending patent application or that any issued patent will provide us with any competitive advantage. We also cannot provide assurance that the patents will not be challenged by third parties or that the patents of others will not materially adversely affect our ability to do business.We may become involved in litigation in the future to protect our intellectual property or because others may allege that we infringed on their intellectual property. These claims and any resulting lawsuit could subject us to liability for damages and invalidate our intellectual property rights. If an infringement claim is successfully asserted by a holder of intellectual property rights, we may be required to cease marketing or selling certain products, pay penalties and spend significant time and money to develop a non-10 CTS CORPORATIONTable of Contentsinfringing product or process or to obtain licenses for the technology, process or information from the holder. We may not be successful in the development of a non-infringing alternative, or licenses may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, in which case we may lose sales and profits. In addition, any litigation could be lengthy and costly and could materially adversely affect us even if we are successful in the litigation.We may experience shortages and increased costs of raw material and required electronic components.Unanticipated raw material or electronic component shortages may prevent us from making scheduled shipments to customers. Our inability to make scheduled shipments could cause us to experience a shortfall in revenue, increase our costs and adversely affect our relationship with affected customers and our reputation as a reliable supplier. We may be required to pay higher prices for raw materials or electronic components in short supply and order these raw materials or electronic components in greater quantities to compensate for variable delivery times. We may also be required to pay higher prices for raw materials or electronic components due to inflationary trends regardless of supply.  We are also dependent on our suppliers' ability to supply and deliver raw materials on a timely basis at negotiated prices.  Any delay or inability to deliver raw materials by our suppliers may require that we attempt to mitigate such failure or fail to make deliveries to our customers on a timely basis. As a result, raw material or electronic component shortages, price increases, or failure to perform by our suppliers could adversely affect our operating results for a particular period due to the resulting revenue shortfall and/or increased costs.Loss of our key management and other personnel, or an inability to attract key management and other personnel, could materially affect our business.We depend on our senior executive officers and other key personnel to run our business. We do not have long-term employment contracts with our key personnel. The loss of any of these officers or other key personnel could adversely affect our operations. Competition for qualified employees among companies that rely heavily on engineering and technology is at times intense, and the loss of qualified employees or an inability to attract, retain and motivate additional highly skilled employees required for the operation and expansion of our business could hinder our ability to conduct research activities and develop marketable products successfully.We are subject to a variety of environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations that expose us to potential financial liability.Our operations are regulated by a number of federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health, and safety (“EHS”) laws and regulations that govern, among other things, air and water emissions, worker protection, and the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials. Compliance with EHS laws and regulations is a major consideration for us because we use hazardous materials in our manufacturing processes. If we violate EHS laws and regulations, we could be liable for substantial fines, penalties, and costs of mandated remedial actions. Our environmental permits could also be revoked or modified, which could require us to cease or limit production at one or more of our facilities, thereby materially adversely affecting our business, financial condition and operating results. EHS laws and regulations have generally become more stringent over time and could continue to do so, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with any violation, which also could materially affect our business, financial condition and operating results.We have been notified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, state environmental agencies and, in some cases, groups of potentially responsible parties, that we are potentially liable for environmental contamination at several sites currently and formerly owned or operated by us, including sites designated as National Priorities List sites under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Superfund program. Superfund liability is joint and several and we may be held responsible for more than our share of contamination at a site.  Although we estimate our potential environmental liability and reserve for such matters, we cannot assure you that our reserves will be sufficient to cover the actual costs that we incur as a result of these matters.Future events, such as the notification of potential liability at new sites, the discovery of additional contamination or changes to an approved remedy at existing sites, changes to existing EHS environmental laws and regulations or their interpretation, and more rigorous regulatory action by government authorities, may require additional expenditures by us, which could have a negative impact on our operations.In addition, we could be affected by future laws or regulations imposed in response to climate change concerns. Such laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.CTS CORPORATION 11Table of ContentsOur indebtedness may adversely affect our financial health.Our debt consists of borrowings under our revolving credit facility.  Our indebtedness could, among other things: increase our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions, including recessions; require us to use cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and other expenses; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness; or limit our ability to borrow additional funds that may be needed to operate and expand our business. Moreover, an increase in interest rates could increase our interest expense.Our credit facility contains provisions that could materially restrict our business.Our revolving credit facility requires us to deliver quarterly financial statements, annual financial statements, auditors certifications and compliance certificates.  Additionally, the revolving credit facility contains restrictions limiting our ability to: dispose of assets; incur certain additional debt; repay other debt or amend subordinated debt instruments; create liens on assets; make investments, loans or advances; make acquisitions or engage in mergers or consolidations; engage in certain transactions with our subsidiaries and affiliates; and repurchases stock or make dividend payments above a certain amount.The restrictions contained in our credit facility could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet capital needs or could otherwise restrict our activities or business plans. These restrictions could adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, make strategic acquisitions, fund investments or other capital needs or engage in other business activities that could be in our interest.Further, our ability to comply with our loan covenants may be affected by events beyond our control that could result in an event of default under our credit facility, or documents governing any other existing or future indebtedness. A default, if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of our indebtedness. In addition, our lenders could terminate their commitments to make further extensions of credit under our credit facility. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds to pay the accelerated indebtedness or that we will have the ability to refinance accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all.Regulations related to conflict minerals could adversely impact our business.The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo (""DRC"") and adjoining countries. As a result, the SEC adopted annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who may use conflict minerals mined from the DRC and adjoining countries in their products. There have been and will continue to be costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including diligence costs to determine the sources of minerals used in our products and other potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply to the extent necessary as a consequence of such verification activities. These rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products. As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering conflict-free minerals, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary conflict-free minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain conflict minerals or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all minerals used in our products through the procedures we may implement.Ineffective internal control over our financial reporting may harm our business.We are subject to the ongoing internal control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (""Sarbanes-Oxley""). Our controls necessary for continued compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley may not operate effectively or at all times and may result in a material weakness. The identification of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting could indicate a lack of proper controls to generate accurate financial statements. Further, the effectiveness of our internal controls may be impacted if we are unable to retain sufficient skilled finance and accounting personnel, especially in light of the increased demand for such personnel among publicly traded companies.12 CTS CORPORATIONTable of ContentsNatural disasters may adversely impact our capability to supply product to our customers.Natural disasters occurring at any of our locations may lead to disruption in our capability to supply product to our customers. In some cases, it may not be possible for us to find an alternate manufacturing location for certain product lines, further impacting our capability to recover from such a disruption.We could face risks to our systems, networks and production including increased IT security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime.Increased global information technology security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and communications. While we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures - including employee training, comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems, and maintenan]ce of backup and protective systems - our systems, networks and products remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats. Depending on their nature and scope, such threats could potentially lead to the compromising of confidential information and communications, improper use of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations.  Additionally, any updates to or implementation of systems may cause delays or disruptions in our processes or production which could adversely affect our results.CTS CORPORATION 13Table of Contents"
6,CTS,CTS CORP,2016-02-24,">Item 1A.  Risk Factors
The following are certain risk factors that could affect our business, financial condition and operating results. These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because these factors could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Before you invest in us, you should know that making such an investment involves some risks, including the risks described below. The risks that are highlighted below are not the only ones that we face. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be negatively affected.Because we currently derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers, any decrease in orders from these customers could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.We depend on a small number of customers for a large portion of our business, and changes in the level of our customers' orders have, in the past, had a significant impact on our results of operations. Our 15 largest customers represent a substantial portion of our sales from continuing operations.  If a major customer significantly delays, reduces, or cancels the level of business it does with us, there could be an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Such an adverse effect would likely be material if one of our largest customers significantly reduces its level of business. Significant pricing and margin pressures exerted by a key customer could also materially adversely affect our operating results. In addition, we generate significant accounts receivable from sales to our major customers. If one or more of our largest customers were to become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay or were to CTS CORPORATION 7Table of Contentsdelay payment for services, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.Negative or unexpected tax consequences could adversely affect our results of operations.Adverse changes in the underlying profitability and financial outlook of our operations in several jurisdictions could lead to changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and other tax accruals that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.Several countries in which we operate provide tax incentives to attract and retain business. These tax incentives expire over various periods and are subject to certain conditions with which we expect to comply. Our taxes could increase if certain tax incentives are not renewed upon expiration, or tax rates applicable to us in such jurisdictions are otherwise increased. In addition, acquisitions or divestitures may cause our effective tax rate to increase.We base our tax accounting positions upon the anticipated nature and conduct of our business and upon our understanding of the tax laws of the various countries in which we have assets or conduct activities. However, our tax accounting positions are subject to review and possible challenge by taxing authorities and to possible changes in law, which may have retroactive effect. We cannot determine in advance the extent to which some jurisdictions may require us to pay taxes or make payments in lieu of taxes.We may be unable to compete effectively against competitors.Our industry is highly competitive and characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change. We compete against many domestic and foreign companies, some of which have substantially greater manufacturing, financial, research and development and marketing resources than we do. If any customer becomes dissatisfied with our prices, quality or timeliness of delivery, among other things, it could award business to our competitors. Moreover, some of our customers could choose to manufacture and develop particular products themselves rather than purchase them from us. Increased competition could result in price reductions, reduced profit margins and loss of market share, each of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. These developments also may materially adversely affect our ability to compete against these manufacturers going forward. We cannot assure you that our products will continue to compete successfully with our competitors' products, including OEMs.We may be unable to keep pace with rapid technological changes that could make some of our products or processes obsolete before we realize a return on our investment.The technologies relating to some of our products have undergone, and are continuing to undergo, rapid and significant changes.  End markets for our products are characterized by technological change, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, changes in customer requirements and emerging industry standards. The introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable before we can recover any or all of our research, development and commercialization expenses or capital investments. Furthermore, the life cycles of our products and the products we manufacture for others vary, may change and are difficult to estimate.We may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of new products or product enhancements and our new products or product enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance. If we are unable, for technological or other reasons, to develop and market new products or product enhancements in a timely and cost-effective manner, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.Our customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities or locations or delay production.We generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers, and have often experienced reduced lead times in customer orders. Customers cancel orders, change production quantities and delay production for a number of reasons. Uncertain economic and geopolitical conditions may result in some of our customers delaying the delivery of some of the products we manufacture for them and placing purchase orders for lower volumes of products than previously anticipated. Cancellations, reductions or delays by a significant customer or by a number of customers may harm our results of operations by reducing the volumes of products we manufacture, as well as by causing a delay in the recovery of our expenditures for inventory in preparation for customer orders and lower asset utilization resulting in lower profitability.In addition, customers may require that manufacturing of their products be transitioned from one of our facilities to another to achieve cost reductions and other objectives. Such transfers may result in inefficiencies and costs due to 8 CTS CORPORATIONTable of Contentsresulting excess capacity and overhead at one facility and capacity constraints and the inability to fulfill all orders at another. In addition, we make significant decisions, including determining the levels of orders that we will seek and accept, production schedules, component procurement commitments, personnel needs and other resource requirements, based on our estimates of customer requirements. The short-term nature of our customers' commitments and the changes in demand for their products may reduce our ability to estimate future customer requirements accurately. This may make it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of our manufacturing capacity. Anticipated orders may not materialize and delivery schedules may be deferred as a result of changes in demand for our products or our customers' products. We often increase staffing and capacity, and incur other expenses to meet the anticipated demand of our customers, which causes reductions in our gross margins if customer orders are delayed or canceled. On occasion, customers require rapid increases in production, which may stress our resources and reduce margins. We may not have sufficient capacity at any given time to meet our customers' demands. In addition, because many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed over the short-term, a reduction in customer demand could harm our gross margin and operating income until such time as adjustments can be made to activity or operating levels and structural costs.We sell products to customers in cyclical industries that are subject to significant downturns that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.We sell products to customers in cyclical industries that have experienced economic and industry downturns. The markets for our products have softened in the past and may again soften in the future. We may face reduced end-customer demand, underutilization of our manufacturing capacity, changes in our revenue mix and other factors that could adversely affect our results of operations in the near-term. We cannot predict whether we will achieve profitability in future periods.Because we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from customers in the automotive, computer and communications industries, we are susceptible to trends and factors affecting those industries.Net sales to the automotive, computer and communications industries represent a substantial portion of our revenues. Factors negatively affecting these industries and the demand for their products also negatively affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Any adverse occurrence, including among others, industry slowdown, recession, political instability, costly or constraining regulations, budget cuts or reduced government spending, armed hostilities, terrorism, excessive inflation, prolonged disruptions in one or more of our customers' production schedules or labor disturbances, that results in significant decline in the volume of sales in these industries, or in an overall downturn in the business and operations of our customers in these industries, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Also, the automotive industry is generally unionized and some of our customers have experienced labor disruptions in the past. Furthermore, the automotive industry is highly cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, consumer preferences and interest rates. Some of our automotive customers have experienced financial distress. The failure of one or more automotive manufacturers that we serve may result in the failure to receive payment in full for products sold in the past and an abrupt cancellation in demand for certain products. Weakness in auto demand, the insolvency of automobile manufacturers that we serve or their suppliers, and constriction of credit markets may negatively and materially affect our facility utilization, cost structure, financial condition, and operating results.Products we manufacture may contain design or manufacturing defects that could result in reduced demand for our products or services and liability claims against us.Despite our quality control and quality assurance efforts, defects may occur in the products we manufacture due to design or manufacturing errors or component failure. Product defects could result in delayed shipments and reduced demand for our products. We may be subject to increased costs due to warranty claims on defective products. Product defects could result in product liability claims against us where defects cause, or are alleged to cause, property damage, bodily injury or death. As we grow our business in the automotive and medical device manufacturing markets, the risk of exposure to product liability litigation increases. We may be required to participate in a recall involving products which are, or are alleged to be, defective. We carry insurance for certain legal matters involving product liability; however, we do not have coverage for all costs related to product defects and the costs of such claims, including costs of defense and settlement, may exceed our available coverage. Accordingly, our results of operations, cash flow and financial position could be adversely affected.CTS CORPORATION 9Table of ContentsWe are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.We transact business in various foreign countries. We present our consolidated financial statements in U.S. dollars, but a portion of our revenues and expenditures are transacted in other currencies. As a result, we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies.  Additionally, we have currency exposure arising from funds held in local currencies in foreign markets. Volatility in the exchange rates between the foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Furthermore, to the extent we sell our products in foreign markets, currency fluctuations may result in our products becoming too expensive for foreign customers.Our operating results vary significantly from period to period.We experience fluctuations in our operating results. Some of the principal factors that contribute to these fluctuations are: changes in demand for our products; our effectiveness in managing manufacturing processes, costs and timing of our component purchases so that components are available when needed for production, while mitigating the risks of purchasing inventory in excess of immediate production needs; the degree to which we are able to utilize our available manufacturing capacity; changes in the cost and availability of components, which often occur in the electronics manufacturing industry and which affect our margins and our ability to meet delivery schedules; general economic and served industry conditions; and local conditions and events that may affect our production volumes, such as labor conditions and political instability.We face risks relating to our international operations.Because we have significant international operations, our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by economic, political, health, regulatory and other factors existing in foreign countries in which we operate. Our international operations are subject to inherent risks, which may materially adversely affect us, including: political and economic instability in countries in which our products are manufactured; expropriation or the imposition of government controls; changes in government regulations; export license requirements; trade restrictions; earnings repatriation and expatriation restrictions; exposure to different legal standards, including related to intellectual property; health conditions and standards; currency controls; fluctuations in exchange rates; increases in the duties and taxes we pay; inflation or deflation; greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer payment cycles; changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing our international operations; limitations on insurance coverage against geopolitical risks, natural disasters and business operations; and communication among and management of international operations. In addition, these same factors may also place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to some of our foreign competitors.In addition, we may face risks associated with violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (""FCPA"") and similar  anti-bribery laws. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our Code of Ethics mandates compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world where strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We cannot assure you that our internal controls and procedures always will protect us from the detrimental actions by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for FCPA violations (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.Furthermore, we may face public health or safety concerns in some of the countries in which we operate that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.We may restructure our operations, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.In 2013, we initiated the June 2013 Plan which is to designed to revise and consolidate certain operations for the purpose of improving our cost structure. The implementation of this plan resulted in the elimination of approximately 350 positions within our global operations. During the fourth quarter of 2014, CTS management amended the June 2013 Plan. The amendment added the elimination of approximately 130 additional positions and additional cost to settle CTS' U.K. pension plan. The positions eliminated will be spread globally throughout CTS businesses. The above actions were substantially complete in 2015.10 CTS CORPORATIONTable of ContentsIn 2014, we initiated a restructuring plan to consolidate our Canadian operations into other existing CTS facilities. These restructuring actions resulted in the elimination of approximately 120 positions in 2015.We may incur restructuring and impairment charges in the future if circumstances warrant. If we are unsuccessful in implementing restructuring plans, we may experience disruptions in our operations and higher ongoing costs, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.Losses in the stock market could negatively impact pension asset returns and ultimately cash flow due to possible required contributions in the future.We make a number of assumptions relating to our pension plans in order to measure the financial position of the plans and the net periodic benefit cost. The most significant assumptions relate to the discount rate and the expected long-term return on plan assets. If these assumptions prove to be significantly different from actual rates, then we may need to record additional expense relating to the pension plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could require cash contributions to fund future pension obligation payments.We may explore acquisitions that complement or expand our business as well as divestitures of various business operations. We may not be able to complete these transactions, and these transactions, if executed, may pose significant risks and may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.We intend to explore opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that could complement, enhance or expand our current business or product lines or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities. We may have difficulty finding these opportunities or, if we do identify these opportunities, we may not be able to complete the transactions for any number of reasons including a failure to secure financing. In addition, we may not be able to successfully or profitably integrate, operate, maintain and manage our newly acquired operations or employees. Any transactions that we are able to identify and complete may involve a number of risks, including: the diversion of management's attention from our existing business to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired or combined business or joint venture; possible adverse effects on our operating results during the integration process; difficulties managing and integrating operations in geographically dispersed locations; increases in our expenses and working capital requirements, which reduce our return on invested capital; exposure to unanticipated liabilities of acquired companies; and our possible inability to achieve the intended objectives of the transaction. Even if we are initially successful in integrating a new operation, we may not be able to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, and this may lead to operational inefficiencies. In addition, future acquisitions may result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of additional debt. These and other factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability at acquired operations or realize other anticipated benefits of an acquisition, and could adversely affect our business and operating results.We have in the past, and may in the future, consider divesting certain business operations. Divestitures may involve a number of risks, including the diversion of management's attention, significant costs and expenses, the loss of customer relationships and cash flow, and the disruption of operations in the affected business. Failure to timely complete or consummate a divestiture may negatively affect valuation of the affected business or result in restructuring charges.If we are unable to protect our intellectual property or we infringe, or are alleged to infringe, on another person's intellectual property, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.The success of our business depends, in part, upon our ability to protect trade secrets, copyrights and patents, obtain or license patents and operate without infringing on the intellectual property rights of others. We rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, patents, nondisclosure agreements and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights in our products and technology. The steps we have taken to prevent misappropriation of our technology may be inadequate. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which we operate do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Although we continue to evaluate and implement protective measures, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful. Our inability to protect our intellectual property rights could diminish or eliminate the competitive advantages that we derive from our technology, cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business.We believe that patents will continue to play an important role in our business. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in securing patents for claims in any pending patent application or that any issued patent CTS CORPORATION 11Table of Contentswill provide us with any competitive advantage. We also cannot provide assurance that the patents will not be challenged by third parties or that the patents of others will not materially adversely affect our ability to do business.We may become involved in litigation in the future to protect our intellectual property or because others may allege that we infringed on their intellectual property. These claims and any resulting lawsuit could subject us to liability for damages and invalidate our intellectual property rights. If an infringement claim is successfully asserted by a holder of intellectual property rights, we may be required to cease marketing or selling certain products, pay penalties and spend significant time and money to develop a non-infringing product or process or to obtain licenses for the technology, process or information from the holder. We may not be successful in the development of a non-infringing alternative, or licenses may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, in which case we may lose sales and profits. In addition, any litigation could be lengthy and costly and could materially adversely affect us even if we are successful in the litigation.We may experience shortages and increased costs of raw material and required electronic components.Unanticipated raw material or electronic component shortages may prevent us from making scheduled shipments to customers. Our inability to make scheduled shipments could cause us to experience a shortfall in revenue, increase our costs and adversely affect our relationship with affected customers and our reputation as a reliable supplier. We may be required to pay higher prices for raw materials or electronic components in short supply and order these raw materials or electronic components in greater quantities to compensate for variable delivery times. We may also be required to pay higher prices for raw materials or electronic components due to inflationary trends regardless of supply. As a result, raw material or electronic component shortages and price increases could adversely affect our operating results for a particular period due to the resulting revenue shortfall and increased costs.Loss of our key management and other personnel, or an inability to attract key management and other personnel, could materially affect our business.We depend on our senior executive officers and other key personnel to run our business. We do not have long-term employment contracts with our key personnel. The loss of any of these officers or other key personnel could adversely affect our operations. Competition for qualified employees among companies that rely heavily on engineering and technology is at times intense, and the loss of qualified employees or an inability to attract, retain and motivate additional highly skilled employees required for the operation and expansion of our business could hinder our ability to conduct research activities successfully and develop marketable products.We are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations that expose us to potential financial liability.Our operations are regulated by a number of federal, state, local and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations that govern, among other things, the discharge of hazardous materials into the air and water as well as the handling, storage and disposal of these materials. Compliance with environmental laws is a major consideration for us because we use hazardous materials in our manufacturing processes. If we violate environmental laws or regulations, we could be held liable for substantial fines, damages, and costs of remedial actions. Our environmental permits could also be revoked or modified, which could require us to cease or limit production at one or more of our facilities, thereby materially adversely affecting our business, financial condition and operating results. Environmental laws and requirements have generally become more stringent over time and could continue to do so, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with any violation, which also could materially affect our business, financial condition and operating results.In addition, because we are a generator of hazardous wastes we may be subject to financial exposure for costs, including costs of investigation and any remediation, associated with contaminated sites at which hazardous substances from our operations have been stored, treated or disposed of. We may also be subject to exposure for such costs at sites that we currently own or operate or formerly owned or operated. Such exposure may be joint and several, so that we may be held responsible for more than our share of the contamination or even for the entire contamination.We have been notified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, state environmental agencies and, in some cases, generator groups that we are or may be a potentially responsible party regarding hazardous substances at several sites either owned, formerly owned, or operated by CTS currently or in the past, including sites designated as Superfund sites. Although we estimate our potential liability with respect to environmental violations or alleged violations and other environmental liabilities and reserves for such matters, we cannot assure you that our reserves will be sufficient to cover the actual costs that we incur as a result of these matters.Future events, such as the discovery of additional contamination or other information concerning past releases of hazardous substances at our manufacturing sites (or at sites to which we have sent wastes for disposal), changes in 12 CTS CORPORATIONTable of Contentsexisting environmental laws or their interpretation, and more rigorous efforts by regulatory authorities, may require additional expenditures by us to modify operations, install pollution control equipment, clean contaminated sites or curtail our operations. These expenditures could have a negative impact on our operations.In addition, we could be affected by future laws or regulations imposed in response to climate change concerns. Such laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operation.Our indebtedness may adversely affect our financial health.Our debt consists of borrowings under our revolving credit facility.  Our indebtedness could, among other things: increase our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions, including recessions; require us to use cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and other expenses; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness; or limit our ability to borrow additional funds that may be needed to operate and expand our business. Moreover, an increase in interest rates could increase our interest expense.Our credit facility contains provisions that could materially restrict our business.Our revolving credit facility requires us to deliver quarterly financial statements, annual financial statements, auditors certifications and compliance certificates.  Additionally, the revolving credit facility contains restrictions limiting our ability to: dispose of assets; incur certain additional debt; repay other debt or amend subordinated debt instruments; create liens on assets; make investments, loans or advances; make acquisitions or engage in mergers or consolidations; engage in certain transactions with our subsidiaries and affiliates; and repurchases stock or make dividend payments above a certain amount.The restrictions contained in our credit facility could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet capital needs or could otherwise restrict our activities or business plans. These restrictions could adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, make strategic acquisitions, fund investments or other capital needs or engage in other business activities that could be in our interest.Further, our ability to comply with our loan covenants may be affected by events beyond our control that could result in an event of default under our credit facility, or documents governing any other existing or future indebtedness. A default, if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of our indebtedness. In addition, our lenders could terminate their commitments to make further extensions of credit under our credit facility. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds to pay the accelerated indebtedness or that we will have the ability to refinance accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all.New regulations related to conflict minerals could adversely impact our business.The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo (""DRC"") and adjoining countries. As a result, in August 2012, the SEC adopted annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who may use conflict minerals mined from the DRC and adjoining countries in their products. The act requires due diligence efforts be initiated in fiscal 2013, with initial disclosure requirements beginning in May 2014. There have been and will continue to be costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including diligence costs to determine the sources of minerals used in our products and other potential changes to products, processes or sources of supply to the extent necessary as a consequence of such verification activities. The implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products. As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering conflict-free minerals, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary conflict-free minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, we may face reputational challenges if we determine that certain of our products contain conflict minerals or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all minerals used in our products through the procedures we may implement.Ineffective internal control over our financial reporting may harm our business.We are subject to the ongoing internal control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (""Sarbanes-Oxley""). Our controls necessary for continued compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley may not operate effectively or at all times and may result in a material weakness. The identification of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting could indicate a lack of proper controls to generate accurate financial statements. Further, the effectiveness CTS CORPORATION 13Table of Contentsof our internal controls may be impacted if we are unable to retain sufficient skilled finance and accounting personnel, especially in light of the increased demand for such personnel among publicly traded companies.Natural disasters may adversely impact our capability to supply product to our customers.Natural disasters occurring at any of our locations may lead to disruption in our capability to supply product to our customers. In some cases, it may not be possible for us to find an alternate manufacturing location for certain product lines, further impacting our capability to recover from such a disruption.Increased IT security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems, networks and products.Increased global information technology security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and communications. While we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures — including employee training, comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems, and maintenance of backup and protective systems — our systems, networks and products remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats. Depending on their nature and scope, such threats could potentially lead to the compromising of confidential information and communications, improper use of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations.14 CTS CORPORATIONTable of Contents"
0,CTS,CTS CORP,2014-03-03,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
   The following are certain risk factorsthat could affect our business, financial condition and operating results. These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because these factors couldcause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Before you invest in us, you should know that making such an investment involves some risks, including the risks describedbelow. The risks that are highlighted below are not the only ones that we face. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be negatively affected. Because we currently derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers, any decrease in orders from these customers could have anadverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.  We depend on a small number of customers for a large portion of ourbusiness, and changes in the level of our customers orders have, in the past, had a significant impact on our results of operations. Our 15 largest customers represent a substantial portion of our sales from continuing operations:approximately 59.8% of net sales in 2013 and 59.5% of net sales in 2012 and 55.5% of net sales in 2011. Our largest customer represented less than 10% of our net sales from continuing operations in 2013, 2012 and 2011. If a major customersignificantly cancels, delays or reduces the amount of business it does with us, there could be an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Such an adverse effect would likely be material if one of our largestcustomers significantly reduces its amount of business. Significant pricing and margin pressures exerted by a key customer could also materially adversely affect our operating results. In addition, we generate significant accounts receivable fromsales to our major customers. If one or more of our largest customers were to become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay or were to delay payment for services, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adverselyaffected.  Negative or unexpected tax consequences could adversely affect our results of operations. Adverse changes in the underlying profitability and financial outlook of our operations in several jurisdictions could lead to changes in our valuation allowancesagainst deferred tax assets and other tax accruals that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.   CTS CORPORATION    7 Table of ContentsSeveral countries in which we are located allow for tax incentives to attract and retain business. These taxincentives expire over various periods and are subject to certain conditions with which we expect to comply. Our taxes could increase if certain tax incentives are not renewed upon expiration, or tax rates applicable to us in such jurisdictions areotherwise increased. In addition, further acquisitions or divestitures may cause our effective tax rate to increase.  We base our tax accountingpositions upon the anticipated nature and conduct of our business and upon our understanding of the tax laws of the various countries in which we have assets or conduct activities. However, our tax accounting positions are subject to review andpossible challenge by taxing authorities and to possible changes in law, which may have retroactive effect. We cannot determine in advance the extent to which some jurisdictions may require us to pay taxes or make payments in lieu of taxes. We may be unable to compete effectively against competitors.  Our industry is highly competitive and characterized by price erosion and rapid technological change. We compete against many domestic and foreign companies, some of which have substantially greater manufacturing,financial, research and development and marketing resources than we do. If any customer becomes dissatisfied with our prices, quality or timeliness of delivery, among other things, it could award future business or even move existing business to ourcompetitors. Moreover, some of our customers could choose to manufacture and develop particular products themselves rather than purchase them from us. Increased competition could result in price reductions, reduced profit margins and loss of marketshare, each of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. These developments also may materially adversely affect our ability to compete against these manufacturers going forward. We cannotassure you that our products will continue to compete successfully with our competitors products, including OEMs, many of which are significantly larger than us and have greater financial and other resources. We may be unable to keep pace with rapid technological changes that could make some of our products or processes obsolete before we realize a return on ourinvestment.  The technologies relating to some of our products have undergone, and are continuing to undergo, rapid and significant changes.Specifically, end markets for electronic components and assemblies are characterized by technological change, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, changes in customer requirements and emerging industry standards. The introduction ofproducts embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable before we can recover any or all of our research, development and commercialization expenses or capitalinvestments. Furthermore, the life cycles of our products and the products we manufacture for others vary, may change and are difficult to estimate.  Wemay experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of new products or product enhancements and our new products or product enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of themarketplace or achieve market acceptance. If we are unable, for technological or other reasons, to develop and market new products or product enhancements in a timely and cost-effective manner, our business, financial condition and operating resultscould be materially adversely affected.  Our customers may cancel their orders, change production quantities or locations or delay production. We generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments from our customers, and have often experienced reduced lead times in customerorders. Customers cancel their orders, change production quantities and delay production for a number of reasons. Uncertain economic and geopolitical conditions may result in some of our customers delaying the delivery of some of the products wemanufacture for them and placing purchase orders for lower volumes of products than previously anticipated. Cancellations, reductions or delays by a significant customer or by a group of customers may harm our results of operations by reducing thevolumes of products we manufacture, as well as by causing a delay in the recovery of our expenditures for inventory in preparation for customer orders and lower asset utilization resulting in lower gross margins.   8    CTS CORPORATION Table of ContentsIn addition, customers may require that manufacturing of their products be transitioned from one facility to anotherto achieve cost and other objectives. Such transfers may result in inefficiencies and costs due to resulting excess capacity and overhead at one facility and capacity constraints and the inability to fulfill all orders at another. In addition, wemake significant decisions, including determining the levels of orders that we will seek and accept, production schedules, component procurement commitments, personnel needs and other resource requirements, based on our estimates of customerrequirements. The short-term nature of our customers commitments and the changes in demand for their products reduce our ability to estimate accurately future customer requirements. This makes it difficult to schedule production and maximizeutilization of our manufacturing capacity. Anticipated orders may not materialize and delivery schedules may be deferred as a result of changes in demand for our products or our customers products. We often increase staffing and capacity, andincur other expenses to meet the anticipated demand of our customers, which causes reductions in our gross margins if customer orders are delayed or canceled. On occasion, customers require rapid increases in production, which may stress ourresources and reduce margins. We may not have sufficient capacity at any given time to meet our customers demands. In addition, because many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed over the short-term, a reduction in customerdemand harms our gross margin and operating income until such time as adjustments can be made to activity or operating levels and structural costs. We sell products to customers in cyclical industries that are subject to significant downturns that could materially adversely affect our business, financialcondition and operating results.  We sell products to customers in cyclical industries that have experienced economic and industry downturns. Themarkets for our products have softened in the past and may again soften in the future. We may face reduced end-customer demand, underutilization of our manufacturing capacity, changes in our revenue mix and other factors that could adversely affectour results of operations in the near-term. We cannot predict whether we will achieve profitability in future periods.  Because we derive asubstantial portion of our revenues from customers in the automotive, computer and communications industries, we are susceptible to trends and factors affecting those industries.  Net sales to the automotive, computer and communications industries represent a substantial portion of our revenues. Factors negatively affecting these industries and the demand for their products also negativelyaffect our business, financial condition and operating results. Any adverse occurrence, including among others, industry slowdown, recession, political instability, costly or constraining regulations, budget cuts or reduced government spending,armed hostilities, terrorism, excessive inflation, prolonged disruptions in one or more of our customers production schedules or labor disturbances, that results in significant decline in the volume of sales in these industries, or in anoverall downturn in the business and operations of our customers in these industries, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Also, the automotive industry is generally highly unionized and some ofour customers have experienced labor disruptions in the past. Furthermore, the automotive industry is highly cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions, consumer preferences and interest rates. Some of our automotivecustomers have required government bailouts and/or have filed for bankruptcy reorganization. The failure of one or more automotive manufacturers that we serve may result in the failure to receive payment in full for products sold and an abruptcancellation in demand for certain products. Weakness in auto demand, the insolvency of automobile manufacturers that we serve or their suppliers, and constriction of credit markets may negatively and materially affect our facility utilization, coststructure, financial condition, and operating results.  Products we manufacture may contain design or manufacturing defects that could result inreduced demand for our products or services and liability claims against us.  Despite our quality control and quality assurance efforts, defects mayoccur in the products we manufacture due to design or manufacturing errors or component failure. Product defects may result in delayed shipments and reduced demand for our products. We may be subject to increased costs due to warranty claims ondefective products. Product defects may result in product liability claims against us where defects cause, or are alleged to cause, property damage, bodily injury or death. As   CTS CORPORATION    9 Table of Contentswe more deeply penetrate the automotive and medical device manufacturing markets, the risk of exposure to product liability litigation increases. We may be required to participate in a recallinvolving products which are, or are alleged to be, defective. We carry insurance for certain legal matters involving product liability; however, we do not have coverage for all costs related to product defects and the costs of such claims,including costs of defense and settlement, may exceed our available coverage. Accordingly, our results of operations, cash flow and financial position could be adversely affected.  Toyotas voluntary recall of CTS-manufactured accelerator pedals and associated events has led to claims against CTS and loss of business.  We manufacture accelerator pedal assemblies for a number of automobile manufacturers, including subsidiaries of Toyota Motor Corporation (Toyota). We have supplied accelerator pedal assemblies to Toyotasince the 2005 model year. Sales to Toyota have accounted for approximately 6.3%, 7.5% and 6.2% of our annual revenue from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. We manufacture all pedalassemblies to specifications approved by the customer, including Toyota.  In January 2010, Toyota issued a voluntary recall for approximately2.3 million vehicles in North America containing CTS-manufactured accelerator pedal assemblies. In addition, Toyota temporarily halted production and sale of eight vehicle models using these pedal assembly designs. The recall was issued due towhat Toyota described as a rare set of conditions which may cause the accelerator pedal to become harder to depress, slower to return or, in the worst case, stuck in a partially depressed position. No accidents, injuries, or deaths have been proven directly or proximately to result from slow returning or sticking CTS-manufactured pedals. We are aware that wehave been named as a defendant in lawsuits filed in the United States and Canada stemming from allegations of problems with Toyota vehicles, and additional lawsuits may follow.  While Toyota has repeatedly acknowledged that CTS designs products to Toyotas specifications and the recall is Toyotas responsibility, and Toyota has agreed to indemnify us in connection with certainthird-party claims and actions, we cannot assure you that Toyota will not seek to recover a portion of their recall-related costs from us, and the insurance we carry may not be sufficient to cover all such costs. Accordingly, our results ofoperations, cash flow and financial position could be adversely affected.  We are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that mayadversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.  We transact business in various foreign countries. We present ourconsolidated financial statements in U.S. dollars, but a portion of our revenues and expenditures are transacted in other currencies. As a result, we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies. We have currency exposure arising from bothsales and purchases denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Volatility in the exchange rates between the foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Furthermore, to theextent we sell our products in foreign markets, currency fluctuations may result in our products becoming too expensive for foreign customers.  Ouroperating results vary significantly from period to period.  We experience fluctuations in our operating results. Some of the principal factors thatcontribute to these fluctuations are: changes in demand for our products; our effectiveness in managing manufacturing processes, costs and timing of our component purchases so that components are available when needed for production, whilemitigating the risks of purchasing inventory in excess of immediate production needs; the degree to which we are able to utilize our available manufacturing capacity; changes in the cost and availability of components, which often occur in theelectronics manufacturing industry and which affect our margins and our ability to meet delivery schedules; general economic and served industry conditions; and local conditions and events that may affect our production volumes, such as laborconditions and political instability.   10    CTS CORPORATION Table of ContentsWe face risks relating to our international operations. Because we have significant international operations, our operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by economic, political,health, regulatory and other factors existing in foreign countries in which we operate. Our international operations are subject to inherent risks, which may materially adversely affect us, including: political and economic instability in countriesin which our products are manufactured; expropriation or the imposition of government controls; changes in government regulations; export license requirements; trade restrictions; earnings repatriation and expatriation restrictions; exposure todifferent legal standards; less favorable intellectual property laws; health conditions and standards; currency controls; fluctuations in exchange rates; increases in the duties and taxes we pay; high levels of inflation or deflation; greaterdifficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer payment cycles; changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing our international operations; limitations on insurance coverage against geopolitical risks, naturaldisasters and business operations; and communication among and management of international operations. In addition, these same factors may also place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to some of our foreign competitors. In addition, we could be adversely affected by violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. The FCPAand similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our Code of Ethics mandates compliancewith these anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices.We cannot assure you that our internal controls and procedures always will protect us from the reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for FCPA violations (either due to our own acts or ourinadvertence or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Furthermore, because a significant portion of our products are manufactured in Asia, including China, Singapore and Taiwan, any conflict or uncertainty in these countries, including public health or safetyconcerns, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.  We may restructure our operations, whichmay materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.  In 2013, we initiated a restructuring plan to realign andconsolidate certain operations for the purpose of improving our cost structure. The implementation of this plan will result in the elimination of approximately 350 positions within our global operations. The implementation is expected to becompleted by the end of 2014.  We may incur restructuring and impairment charges in the future if circumstances warrant. If we are unsuccessful inimplementing restructuring plans, we may experience disruptions in our operations and higher ongoing costs, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Losses in the stock market could negatively impact pension asset returns and ultimately cash flow due to possible required contributions in the future. We make a number of assumptions relating to our pension plans in order to measure the financial position of the plans and the net periodic benefitcost. The most significant assumptions relate to the discount rate and the expected long-term return on plan assets. If these assumptions prove to be significantly different from actual rates, then we may need to record additional expense relatingto the pension plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could require cash contributions to fund future pension obligation payments.  We may explore acquisitions that complement or expand our business as well as divestitures of various business operations. We may not be able to complete these transactions, and these transactions, if executed,  CTS CORPORATION    11 Table of Contentsmay pose significant risks and may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.  We intend to explore opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that could complement, enhance or expand our current business or product lines or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities. Wemay have difficulty finding these opportunities or, if we do identify these opportunities, we may not be able to complete the transactions for reasons including a failure to secure financing. In addition, we may not be able to successfully orprofitably integrate, operate, maintain and manage our newly acquired operations or employees. Any transactions that we are able to identify and complete may involve a number of risks, including: the diversion of managements attention from ourexisting business to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired or combined business or joint venture; possible adverse effects on our operating results during the integration process; difficulties managing and integrating operations ingeographically dispersed locations; increases in our expenses and working capital requirements, which reduce our return on invested capital; exposure to unanticipated liabilities of acquired companies; and our possible inability to achieve theintended objectives of the transaction. Even if we are initially successful in integrating a new operation, we may not be able to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, and this may lead to operational inefficiencies. Inaddition, future acquisitions may result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of additional debt. These and other factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability at acquired operations or realizeother anticipated benefits of an acquisition, and could adversely affect our business and operating results.  We have in the past, and may in thefuture, consider divesting certain business operations. Divestitures may involve a number of risks, including the diversion of managements attention, significant costs and expenses, the loss of customer relationships and cash flow, and thedisruption of operations in the affected business. Failure to timely complete or consummate a divestiture may negatively affect valuation of the affected business or result in restructuring charges. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property or we infringe, or are alleged to infringe, on another persons intellectual property, our business,financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.  The success of our business depends, in part, upon our ability toprotect trade secrets, copyrights and patents, obtain or license patents and operate without infringing on the intellectual property rights of others. We rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, patents, nondisclosure agreements andtechnical measures to protect our proprietary rights in our products and technology. The steps we have taken to prevent misappropriation of our technology may be inadequate. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which we operate do notprotect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Although we continue to evaluate and implement protective measures, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful. Our inability to protect ourintellectual property rights could diminish or eliminate the competitive advantages that we derive from our technology, cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business.  We believe that patents will continue to play an important role in our business. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in securing patents for claims in any pending patent application orthat any issued patent will provide us with any competitive advantage. We also cannot provide assurance that the patents will not be challenged by third parties or that the patents of others will not materially adversely affect our ability to dobusiness.  We may become involved in litigation in the future to protect our intellectual property or because others may allege that we infringed ontheir intellectual property. These claims and any resulting lawsuit could subject us to liability for damages and invalidate our intellectual property rights. If an infringement claim is successfully asserted by a holder of intellectual propertyrights, we may be required to cease marketing or selling certain products, pay a penalty for past infringement and spend significant time and money to develop a non-infringing product or process or to obtain licenses for the technology, process orinformation from the holder. We may not be successful in the development of a non-infringing alternative, or licenses may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, in which case we may lose sales and profits. In addition, anylitigation could be lengthy and costly and could materially adversely affect us even if we are successful in the litigation.   12    CTS CORPORATION Table of ContentsWe may experience shortages and increased costs of raw material and required electronic components. In the past, from time to time, there have been shortages in certain raw materials used in the manufacture of our components and sensors and certain electroniccomponents purchased by us and incorporated into assemblies and subassemblies. Unanticipated raw material or electronic component shortages may prevent us from making scheduled shipments to customers. Our inability to make scheduled shipments couldcause us to experience a shortfall in revenue, increase our costs and adversely affect our relationship with affected customers and our reputation as a reliable supplier. We may be required to pay higher prices for raw materials or electroniccomponents in short supply and order these raw materials or electronic components in greater quantities to compensate for variable delivery times. We may also be required to pay higher prices for raw materials or electronic components due toinflationary trends regardless of supply. As a result, raw material or electronic component shortages and price increases could adversely affect our operating results for a particular period due to the resulting revenue shortfall and increasedcosts.  Loss of our key management and other personnel, or an inability to attract key management and other personnel, could materially affect ourbusiness.  We depend on our senior executive officers and other key personnel to run our business. We do not have long-term retention contracts withour key personnel. The loss of any of these officers or other key personnel could adversely affect our operations. Competition for qualified employees among companies that rely heavily on engineering and technology is at times intense, and the lossof qualified employees or an inability to attract, retain and motivate additional highly skilled employees required for the operation and expansion of our business could hinder our ability to conduct research activities successfully and developmarketable products.  We are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations that expose us to potential financial liability. Our operations are regulated by a number of federal, state, local and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations that govern, amongother things, the discharge of hazardous materials into the air and water as well as the handling, storage and disposal of these materials. Compliance with environmental laws is a major consideration for us because we use hazardous materials in ourmanufacturing processes. If we violate environmental laws or regulations, we could be held liable for substantial fines, damages, and costs of remedial actions. Our environmental permits could also be revoked or modified, which could require us tocease or limit production at one or more of our facilities, thereby materially adversely affecting our business, financial condition and operating results. Environmental laws and requirements have generally become more stringent over time and couldcontinue to do so, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with any violation, which also could materially affect our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, because we are a generator of hazardous wastes, even if we fully comply with applicable environmental laws and requirements, we may be subject tofinancial exposure for costs, including costs of investigation and any remediation, associated with contaminated sites at which hazardous substances from our operations have been stored, treated or disposed of. We may also be subject to exposure forsuch costs at sites that we currently own or operate or formerly owned or operated. Such exposure may be joint and several, so that we may be held responsible for more than our share of the contamination or even for the entire contamination. We have been notified by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, state environmental agencies and, in some cases, generator groups that we are or maybe a potentially responsible party regarding hazardous substances at several sites not owned or operated by us, as well as several sites that we own. Although we estimate our potential liability with respect to environmental violations or allegedviolations and other environmental liabilities and reserves for such matters, we cannot assure you that our reserves will be sufficient to cover the actual costs that we incur as a result of these matters. Future events, such as the discovery of additional contamination or other information concerning past releases of hazardous substances at our manufacturing sites(or at sites we have sent wastes for disposal), changes in existing environmental laws or their interpretation, and more rigorous efforts by regulatory authorities, may require additional expenditures by us to  CTS CORPORATION    13 Table of Contentsmodify operations, install pollution control equipment, clean contaminated sites or curtail our operations. These expenditures could have a negative impact on our operations. In addition, we could be affected by future laws or regulations imposed in response to climate change concerns. Such laws or regulations could have a materialadverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operation.  Our indebtedness may adversely affect our financial health. As of December 31, 2013, our debt balance was $75.0 million, consisting of borrowings under our revolving credit facility. The level of ourindebtedness could, among other things: increase our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions, including recessions; require us to use cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to fundworking capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and other expenses; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate; place us at a competitive disadvantagecompared to competitors that have less indebtedness; or limit our ability to borrow additional funds that may be needed to operate and expand our business. Moreover, an increase in interest rates could increase our interest expense. Our credit facility contains provisions that could materially restrict our business.  Our revolving credit facility requires us to deliver quarterly financial statements, annual financial statements, auditors certifications and compliance certificates within a specified number of days after the endof a quarter and year. Additionally, the revolving credit facility contains restrictions limiting our ability to: dispose of assets; incur certain additional debt; repay other debt or amend subordinated debt instruments; create liens on assets; makeinvestments, loans or advances; make acquisitions or engage in mergers or consolidations; engage in certain transactions with our subsidiaries and affiliates; and the amounts allowed for stock repurchases and dividend payments. The restrictions contained in our credit facility could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet capital needs or could otherwiserestrict our activities or business plans. These restrictions could adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, strategic acquisitions, investments or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that could be in ourinterests.  Further, our ability to comply with our loan covenants may be affected by events beyond our control and if we breach any of these covenantsor restrictions, it could result in an event of default under our credit facility, or documents governing any other existing or future indebtedness. A default, if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of our indebtedness. In addition, ourlenders could terminate their commitments to make further extensions of credit under our credit facility. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds to pay the accelerated indebtedness or that we willhave the ability to refinance accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all.  New regulations related to conflict minerals couldadversely impact our business.  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency andaccountability concerning the supply of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries. As a result, in August 2012, the SEC adopted annual disclosure and reportingrequirements for those companies who use conflict minerals mined from the DRC and adjoining countries in their products. This act required due diligence efforts to be initiated in fiscal 2013, with initial disclosure requirements beginning in May2014. There have been and will continue be costs associated with complying with these disclosure requirements, including for diligence to determine the sources of conflict minerals used in our products and other potential changes to products,processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. The implementation of these rules could adversely affect the sourcing, supply and pricing of materials used in our products. As there may be only a limited number ofsuppliers offering conflict-free minerals, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain necessary conflict minerals from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, we may face reputational challenges if we determinethat certain of our products contain minerals not determined to be conflict free or if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for all conflict minerals used in our products through the procedures we may implement.   14    CTS CORPORATION Table of ContentsIneffective internal control over our financial reporting may harm our business in the future. We are subject to the ongoing internal control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (Sarbanes-Oxley). Our controlsnecessary for continued compliance with Sarbanes-Oxley may not operate effectively at all times and may result in a material weakness. The identification of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, if any, could indicate alack of proper controls to generate accurate financial statements. Further, the effectiveness of our internal controls may be impacted if we are unable to retain sufficient skilled finance and accounting personnel, especially in light of theincreased demand for such personnel among publicly traded companies"
9,CTS,CTS CORP,2012-02-24,">Item 1A.Risk Factors
  The following are certain risk factorsthat could affect our business, financial condition and operating results. These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because these factors couldcause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements. Before you invest in CTS, you should know that making such an investment involves some risks, including the risks describedbelow. The risks that are highlighted below are not the only ones that we face. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or operating results could be negatively affected. Because we currently derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers, any decrease in orders from these customers could have anadverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.  We depend on a small number of customers for a large portion of ourbusiness, and changes in the level of our customers orders have, in the past, had a significant impact on our results of operations. Our 15 largest customers represent a substantial portion of our sales: approximately 48% of net sales in 2011;48% of net sales in 2010; and 51% of net sales in 2009. Our largest customer represented less than 10% of our net sales in 2011, 2010 and 2009. If a major customer significantly cancels, delays or reduces the amount of business it does with us,there could be an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Such an adverse effect would likely be material if one of our largest customers significantly reduces its amount of business. Significant pricing and marginpressures exerted by a key customer could also materially adversely affect our operating results. In addition, we generate significant accounts receivable from sales to our major customers. If one or more of our largest customers were to becomeinsolvent or otherwise unable to pay or were to delay payment for services, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.  Negative or unexpected tax consequences could adversely affect our results of operations.  Adverse changes inthe underlying profitability and financial outlook of our operations in several jurisdictions could lead to changes in our valuation allowances against deferred tax assets and other tax accruals that could materially and adversely affect our resultsof operations.   CTS CORPORATION    7 Table of ContentsSeveral countries in which we are located allow for tax incentives to attract and retain business. These taxincentives expire over various periods and are subject to certain conditions with which we expect to comply. Our taxes could increase if certain tax incentives are not renewed upon expiration, or tax rates applicable to us in such jurisdictions areotherwise increased. In addition, further acquisitions or divestitures may cause our effective tax rate to increase.  We base our tax position upon theanticipated nature and conduct of our business and upon our understanding of the tax laws of the various countries in which we have assets or conduct activities. However, our tax position is subject to review and possible challenge by taxingauthorities and to possible changes in law, which may have retroactive effect. We cannot determine in advance the extent to which some jurisdictions may require us to pay taxes or make payments in lieu of taxes. We are subject to intense competition in the EMS industry. We compete against many providers of electronics manufacturing services. Some of our competitors have substantially greater manufacturing and financial resources,and in some cases have more geographically diversified international operations, than we do. Our competitors, such as Benchmark Electronics, Inc., and Sanmina-SCI Corporation, include both large global EMS providers and smaller EMS companies thatoften have a regional, product, service or industry specific focus. We also face competition from the manufacturing operations of our current and future OEM customers, which may elect to manufacture their own products internally rather thanoutsource the manufacturing to EMS providers. In addition, we could face competition in the future from other large global EMS providers, such as Celestica, Inc., Flextronics International Ltd. and Jabil Circuit, Inc., which currently provideservices to some of our largest customers for different products, as well as competition from smaller EMS companies such as Plexus Corp. and Ducommun, Inc. We may be at a competitive disadvantage with respect to price when compared to manufacturerswith lower cost structures, particularly those with significant offshore facilities located where labor and other costs are lower. Competition may intensify further if more companies enter the markets in which we operate. Our failure to competeeffectively could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.  We may be unable to compete effectivelyagainst competitors in our Components and Sensors segment.  The components and sensors industry is highly competitive and characterized by priceerosion and rapid technological change. Through our Components and Sensors segment, we compete against many domestic and foreign companies, some of which have substantially greater manufacturing, financial, research and development and marketingresources than we do. If any customer becomes dissatisfied with our prices, quality or timeliness of delivery, among other things, it could award future business or even move existing business to our competitors. Moreover, some of our customerscould choose to manufacture and develop particular products themselves rather than purchase them from us. Increased competition could result in price reductions, reduced profit margins and loss of market share, each of which could materiallyadversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. These developments also may materially adversely affect our ability to compete against these manufacturers going forward. We cannot assure you that our products will continueto compete successfully with our competitors products, including OEMs, many of which are significantly larger than we are and have greater financial and other resources.  We may be unable to keep pace with rapid technological changes that could make some of our products or processes obsolete before we realize a return on our investment. The technologies relating to some of our products have undergone, and are continuing to undergo, rapid and significant changes. Specifically, end markets forelectronic components and assemblies are characterized by technological change, frequent new product introductions and enhancements, changes in customer requirements and emerging industry standards. The introduction of products embodying newtechnologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable before we can recover any or all of our research, development and commercialization expenses or capital investments. Furthermore,the life cycles of our products and the products we manufacture for others vary, may change and are difficult to estimate.  We may experiencedifficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, introduction and marketing of new products or product enhancements and our new products or product enhancements may not adequately meet the  8    CTS CORPORATION Table of Contentsrequirements of the marketplace or achieve market acceptance. If we are unable, for technological or other reasons, to develop and market new products or product enhancements in a timely andcost-effective manner, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.  Our customers may canceltheir orders, change production quantities or locations or delay production.  We generally do not obtain firm, long-term purchase commitments fromour customers, and have often experienced reduced lead times in customer orders. Customers cancel their orders, change production quantities and delay production for a number of reasons. Uncertain economic and geopolitical conditions may result insome of our customers delaying the delivery of some of the products we manufacture for them and placing purchase orders for lower volumes of products than previously anticipated. Cancellations, reductions or delays by a significant customer or by agroup of customers may harm our results of operations by reducing the volumes of products we manufacture, as well as by causing a delay in the recovery of our expenditures for inventory in preparation for customer orders and lower asset utilizationresulting in lower gross margins.  In addition, customers may require that manufacturing of their products be transitioned from one facility to anotherto achieve cost and other objectives. Such transfers may result in inefficiencies and costs due to resulting excess capacity and overhead at one facility and capacity constraints and the inability to fulfill all orders at another. In addition, wemake significant decisions, including determining the levels of orders that we will seek and accept, production schedules, component procurement commitments, personnel needs and other resource requirements, based on our estimates of customerrequirements. The short-term nature of our customers commitments and the changes in demand for their products reduce our ability to estimate accurately future customer requirements. This makes it difficult to schedule production and maximizeutilization of our manufacturing capacity. Anticipated orders may not materialize and delivery schedules may be deferred as a result of changes in demand for our products or our customers products. We often increase staffing and capacity, andincur other expenses to meet the anticipated demand of our customers, which causes reductions in our gross margins if customer orders are delayed or canceled. On occasion, customers require rapid increases in production, which may stress ourresources and reduce margins. We may not have sufficient capacity at any given time to meet our customers demands. In addition, because many of our costs and operating expenses are relatively fixed over the short term, a reduction in customerdemand harms our gross margin and operating income until such time as adjustments can be made to activity or operating levels and structural costs. We sell products to customers in cyclical industries that are subject to significant downturns that could materially adversely affect our business, financialcondition and operating results.  We sell products to customers in cyclical industries that have experienced economic and industry downturns. Thesemarkets for our automotive products, electronic components and sensors and EMS products have softened in the past and may again soften in the future. We may face reduced end-customer demand, underutilization of our manufacturing capacity, changes inour revenue mix and other factors that could adversely affect our results of operations in the near term. We cannot predict whether we will achieve profitability in future periods.  Because we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from customers in the automotive, defense and aerospace, computer and communications industries, we are susceptible to trends and factors affecting thoseindustries.  Net sales to the automotive, defense and aerospace, computer and communications industries represent a substantial portion of ourrevenues. Factors negatively affecting these industries and the demand for their products also negatively affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Any adverse occurrence, including among others, industry slowdown, recession,political instability, costly or constraining regulations, armed hostilities, terrorism, excessive inflation, prolonged disruptions in one or more of our customers production schedules or labor disturbances, that results in significant declinein the volume of sales in these industries, or in an overall downturn in the business and operations of our customers in these industries, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Also, theautomotive industry is generally highly unionized and some of our customers have, in the past, experienced labor disruptions. Furthermore, the automotive industry is highly cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions,  CTS CORPORATION    9 Table of Contentsconsumer preferences and interest rates. Some of our automotive customers have required government bailouts and/or have filed for bankruptcy reorganization. The failure of one or more automotivemanufacturers may result in the failure to receive payment in full for products sold and an abrupt cancellation in demand for certain products. Weakness in auto demand, the insolvency of automobile manufacturers or their suppliers, and constrictionof credit markets may negatively and materially affect our facility utilization, cost structure, financial condition, and operating results. Products we manufacture may contain design or manufacturing defects that could result in reduced demand for our products or services and liability claimsagainst us.  Despite our quality control and quality assurance efforts, defects may occur in the products we manufacture due to design ormanufacturing errors or component failure. Product defects may result in delayed shipments and reduced demand for our products. We may be subject to increased costs due to warranty claims on defective products. Product defects may result in productliability claims against us where defects cause, or are alleged to cause, property damage, bodily injury or death. As we more deeply penetrate the automotive and medical device manufacturing markets, the risk of exposure to products liabilitylitigation increases. We may be required to participate in a recall involving products which are, or are alleged to be, defective. We carry insurance for certain legal matters involving product liability; however, we do not have coverage for allcosts related to product defects and the costs of such claims, including costs of defense and settlement, may exceed our available coverage. Toyotas voluntary recall of CTS-manufactured accelerator pedals and associated events has led to claims against CTS and loss of business. We manufacture accelerator pedal assemblies for a number of automobile manufacturers, including subsidiaries of Toyota Motor Corporation (Toyota). Wehave supplied accelerator pedal assemblies to Toyota since the 2005 model year. Sales to Toyota have accounted for approximately 2.9%, 4.0% and 3.2% of our annual revenue for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Wemanufacture all pedal assemblies to specifications approved by the customer, including Toyota.  In January 2010, Toyota issued a voluntary recall forapproximately 2.3 million vehicles in North America containing CTS-manufactured accelerator pedal assemblies. In addition, Toyota temporarily halted production and sale of eight vehicle models using these pedal assembly designs. The recall wasissued due to what Toyota described as a rare set of conditions which may cause the accelerator pedal to become harder to depress, slower to return or, in the worst case, stuck in a partially depressed position. No accidents, injuries, or deaths have been proven directly or proximately to result from slow returning or sticking CTS-manufactured pedals. We are aware that wehave been named as a defendant in lawsuits filed in the United States and Canada stemming from allegations of problems with Toyota vehicles, and additional lawsuits may follow.  While Toyota has repeatedly acknowledged that CTS designs products to Toyotas specifications and the recall is Toyotas responsibility, and Toyota has agreed to indemnify us in connection with certainthird-party claims and actions, we cannot assure you that Toyota will not seek to recover a portion of their recall-related costs from us, and the insurance we carry may not be sufficient to cover all such costs. We also cannot assure you that theNational Highway Transportation Safety Administration or other governmental authorities will not attempt to impose fines and penalties upon us and Toyota or other automobile manufactures will not reduce their purchase of CTS pedals and otherautomotive products. Accordingly, our results of operations, cash flow and financial position could be adversely affected.  We are exposed tofluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates that may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.  We transactbusiness in various foreign countries. We present our consolidated financial statements in U.S. dollars, but a portion of our revenues and expenditures are transacted in other currencies. As a result, we are exposed to fluctuations in foreigncurrencies. We have currency exposure arising from both sales and purchases denominated in currencies other than   10    CTS CORPORATION Table of Contentsthe U.S. dollar. Volatility in the exchange rates between the foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Furthermore, to the extentwe sell our products in foreign markets, currency fluctuations may result in our products becoming too expensive for foreign customers.  Ouroperating results vary significantly from period to period.  We experience fluctuations in our operating results. Some of the principal factors thatcontribute to these fluctuations are: changes in demand for our products; our effectiveness in managing manufacturing processes, costs and timing of our component purchases so that components are available when needed for production, whilemitigating the risks of purchasing inventory in excess of immediate production needs; the degree to which we are able to utilize our available manufacturing capacity; changes in the cost and availability of components, which often occur in theelectronics manufacturing industry and which affect our margins and our ability to meet delivery schedules; general economic and served industry conditions; and local conditions and events that may affect our production volumes, such as laborconditions and political instability.  In addition, due to the significant differences in the operating earnings margins in our two reporting segments,the mix of sales between our Components and Sensors segment and our EMS segment affects our operating results from period to period.  We face risksrelating to our international operations.  Because we have significant international operations, our operating results and financial condition couldbe materially adversely affected by economic, political, health, regulatory and other factors existing in foreign countries in which we operate. Our international operations are subject to inherent risks, which may materially adversely affect us,including: political and economic instability in countries in which our products are manufactured; expropriation or the imposition of government controls; changes in government regulations; export license requirements; trade restrictions; earningsrepatriation and expatriation restrictions; exposure to different legal standards; less favorable intellectual property laws; health conditions and standards; currency controls; fluctuations in exchange rates; increases in the duties and taxes wepay; high levels of inflation or deflation; greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer payment cycles; changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing our international operations; limitations on insurancecoverage against geopolitical risks, natural disasters and business operations; and communication among and management of international operations. In addition, these same factors may also place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to some ofour foreign competitors.  In addition, we could be adversely affected by violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and similarworldwide anti-bribery laws. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business.Our Code of Ethics mandates compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws mayconflict with local customs and practices. We cannot assure you that our internal controls and procedures always will protect us from the reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for FCPAviolations (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, because a significant portion of our products are manufactured in Asia, including China, Singapore, Thailand and Taiwan, any conflict or uncertaintyin these countries, including public health or safety concerns, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.  We may restructure our operations, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.  In 2011, we implemented two restructuring plans to realign and consolidate certain operations for the purpose of improving their cost structures. The implementation of this plan resulted in the elimination ofapproximately 130 positions within our global operations. The implementation was substantially completed by the end of December 2011.   CTS CORPORATION    11 Table of ContentsWe may incur restructuring and impairment charges in the future if circumstances warrant. If we restructure ouroperations in the future and are unsuccessful in implementing restructuring plans, we may experience disruptions in our operations and higher ongoing costs, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operatingresults.  Losses in the stock market could negatively impact pension asset returns and ultimately cash flow due to possible required contributions inthe future.  We make a number of assumptions relating to our pension plans in order to measure the financial position of the plans and the netperiodic benefit cost. The most significant assumptions relate to the discount rate, the expected long term return on plan assets and the rate of future compensation increases. If these assumptions prove to be significantly different from actualrates, then we may need to record additional expense relating to the pension plans, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and could require cash contributions to fund future pension obligation payments. We may explore acquisitions that complement or expand our business as well as divestitures of various business operations. We may not be able to complete thesetransactions, and these transactions, if executed, may pose significant risks and may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.  We intend to explore opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that could complement, enhance or expand our current business or product lines or that might otherwise offer us growth opportunities. Wemay have difficulty finding these opportunities or, if we do identify these opportunities, we may not be able to complete the transactions for reasons including a failure to secure financing. In addition, we may not be able to successfully orprofitably integrate, operate, maintain and manage our newly acquired operations or employees. Any transactions that we are able to identify and complete may involve a number of risks, including: the diversion of managements attention from ourexisting business to integrate the operations and personnel of the acquired or combined business or joint venture; possible adverse affects on our operating results during the integration process; difficulties managing and integrating operations ingeographically dispersed locations; increases in our expenses and working capital requirements, which reduce our return on invested capital; exposure to unanticipated liabilities of acquired companies; and our possible inability to achieve theintended objectives of the transaction. Even if we are initially successful in integrating a new operation, we may not be able to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies, and this may lead to operational inefficiencies. Inaddition, future acquisitions may result in dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of additional debt. These and other factors could harm our ability to achieve anticipated levels of profitability at acquired operations or realizeother anticipated benefits of an acquisition, and could adversely affect our business and operating results.  We have in the past, and may in thefuture, consider divesting certain business operations. Divestitures may involve a number of risks, including the diversion of managements attention, significant costs and expenses, the loss of customer relationships and cash flow, and thedisruption of operations in the affected business. Failure to timely complete or consummate a divestiture may negatively affect valuation of the affected business or result in restructuring charges. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property or we infringe, or are alleged to infringe, on another persons intellectual property, our business,financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.  The success of our business depends, in part, upon our ability toprotect trade secrets, copyrights and patents, obtain or license patents and operate without infringing on the intellectual property rights of others. We rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, patents, nondisclosure agreements andtechnical measures to protect our proprietary rights in our products and technology. The steps we have taken to prevent misappropriation of our technology may be inadequate. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries in which we operate do notprotect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. Although we continue to evaluate and implement protective measures, there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful. Our inability to protect ourintellectual property rights could diminish or eliminate the competitive advantages that we derive from our technology, cause us to lose sales or otherwise harm our business.   12    CTS CORPORATION Table of ContentsWe believe that patents will continue to play an important role in our business. However, there can be no assurancethat we will be successful in securing patents for claims in any pending patent application or that any issued patent will provide us with any competitive advantage. We also cannot provide assurance that the patents will not be challenged by thirdparties or that the patents of others will not materially adversely affect our ability to do business.  We may become involved in litigation in thefuture to protect our intellectual property or because others may allege that we infringed on their intellectual property. These claims and any resulting lawsuit could subject us to liability for damages and invalidate our intellectual propertyrights. If an infringement claim is successfully asserted by a holder of intellectual property rights, we may be required to cease marketing or selling certain products, pay a penalty for past infringement and spend significant time and money todevelop a non-infringing product or process or to obtain licenses for the technology, process or information from the holder. We may not be successful in the development of a non-infringing alternative, or licenses may not be available oncommercially acceptable terms, if at all, in which case we may lose sales and profits. In addition, any litigation could be lengthy and costly and could materially adversely affect us even if we are successful in the litigation. We may experience shortages and increased costs of raw material and required electronic components. In the past, from time to time, there have been shortages in certain raw materials used in the manufacture of our components and sensors and certain electroniccomponents purchased by us and incorporated into assemblies and subassemblies. Unanticipated raw material or electronic component shortages may prevent us from making scheduled shipments to customers. Our inability to make scheduled shipments couldcause us to experience a shortfall in revenue, increase our costs and adversely affect our relationship with affected customers and our reputation as a reliable service provider. We may be required to pay higher prices for raw materials orelectronic components in short supply and order these raw materials or electronic components in greater quantities to compensate for variable delivery times. We may also be required to pay higher prices for raw materials or electronic components dueto inflationary trends regardless of supply. As a result, raw material or electronic component shortages and price increases could adversely affect our operating results for a particular period due to the resulting revenue shortfall and increasedcosts.  Loss of our key management and other personnel, or an inability to attract key management and other personnel, could materially affect ourbusiness.  We depend on our senior executive officers and other key personnel to run our business. We do not have long-term retention contracts withour key personnel. The loss of any of these officers or other key personnel could adversely affect our operations. Competition for qualified employees among companies that rely heavily on engineering and technology is at times intense, and the lossof qualified employees or an inability to attract, retain and motivate additional highly skilled employees required for the operation and expansion of our business could hinder our ability to conduct research activities successfully and developmarketable products.  We are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations that expose us to potential financial liability. Our operations are regulated by a number of federal, state, local and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations that govern, amongother things, the discharge of hazardous materials into the air and water as well as the handling, storage and disposal of these materials. Compliance with environmental laws is a major consideration for us because we use hazardous materials in ourmanufacturing processes. If we violate environmental laws or regulations, we could be held liable for substantial fines, damages, and costs of remedial actions. Our environmental permits could also be revoked or modified, which could require us tocease or limit production at one or more of our facilities, thereby materially adversely affecting our business, financial condition and operating results. Environmental laws and requirements have generally become more stringent over time and couldcontinue to do so, imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with any violation, which also could materially affect our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, because we are a generator of hazardous wastes, even if we fully comply with applicable environmental laws and requirements, we may be subject tofinancial exposure for costs, including costs of investigation and any remediation, associated with contaminated sites at which hazardous substances from our operations have been stored, treated or disposed  CTS CORPORATION    13 Table of Contentsof. We may also be subject to exposure for such costs at sites that we currently own or operate or formerly owned or operated. Such exposure may be joint and several, so that we may be heldresponsible for more than our share of the contamination or even for the entire contamination.  We have been notified by the U.S. EnvironmentalProtection Agency, state environmental agencies and, in some cases, generator groups that we are or may be a potentially responsible party regarding hazardous substances at several sites not owned or operated by us, as well as several sites that weown. Although we estimate our potential liability with respect to environmental violations or alleged violations and other environmental liabilities and reserves for such matters, we cannot assure you that our reserves will be sufficient to coverthe actual costs that we incur as a result of these matters. We also cannot assure you that additional contamination will not be found in the future, either at sites currently known to us or at other sites. Any liability we may have for such matterscould materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.  Our indebtedness may adversely affect our financialhealth.  As of December 31, 2011, our debt balance was $74.4 million, consisting of borrowings under our revolving credit facility. The levelof our indebtedness could, among other things: increase our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions, including recessions; require us to use cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability tofund working capital, capital expenditures, research and development efforts and other expenses; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate; place us at a competitivedisadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness; or limit our ability to borrow additional funds that may be needed to operate and expand our business.  Our credit agreement contains provisions that could materially restrict our business.  Our revolving creditagreement requires us to deliver quarterly financial statements, annual financial statements, auditors certifications and compliance certificates within a specified number of days after the end of a quarter and year. Additionally, the revolvingcredit agreement contains restrictions limiting our ability to: dispose of assets; incur certain additional debt; repay other debt or amend subordinated debt instruments; create liens on assets; make investments, loans or advances; make acquisitionsor engage in mergers or consolidations; engage in certain transactions with our subsidiaries and affiliates; and the amounts allowed for stock repurchases and dividend payments.  The restrictions contained in our credit agreement could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet capital needs or could otherwise restrict our activities or business plans. Theserestrictions could adversely affect our ability to finance our operations, strategic acquisitions, investments or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that could be in our interests. Further, our ability to comply with our loan covenants may be affected by events beyond our control and if we breach any of these covenants or restrictions, itcould result in an event of default under our credit facility, or documents governing any other existing or future indebtedness. A default, if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of our indebtedness. In addition, our lenders could terminatetheir commitments to make further extensions of credit under our credit agreement. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds to pay the accelerated indebtedness or that we will have the ability torefinance accelerated indebtedness on terms favorable to us or at all.  We may not be able to recover all costs and losses incurred as a result ofthe flood impact on our manufacturing operation in Thailand. In addition, we may see an increase in our cost to obtain property and business interruption insurance, or have difficulty in obtaining adequate coverage at some of our locations. We operate various manufacturing operations globally. In 2011, various parts of our business were impacted by two significant natural disasters the earthquake and subsequent tsunami in Japan, and then later in the year, the flood in Thailand. Although none of our manufacturing operations were directly impacted by the earthquake, demand for our automotive products decreased as aresult of this natural disaster. In Thailand, our factory was impacted, and we have an ongoing insurance claim for this loss. Our ability to recover costs and losses from the insurance carrier may have an impact on financial performance in 2012.  14    CTS CORPORATION Table of ContentsIn addition, all insurance carriers are evaluating high risk areas for coverage and premium considerations. It ispossible that we may have difficulty in obtaining adequate insurance coverage for our manufacturing locations that get classified as high risk zones for potential natural disasters. It is also possible that we may see an increase in costto obtain insurance coverage for these locations.  Ineffective internal control over financial reporting may harm our business in the future. We are subject to the ongoing internal control provisions of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the Act). Our controlsnecessary for continued compliance with the Act may not operate effectively at all times and may result in a material weakness. The identification of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, if any, could indicate a lack ofproper controls to generate accurate financial statements. Further, our internal control effectiveness may be impacted if we are unable to retain sufficient skilled finance and accounting personnel, especially in light of the increased demand forsuch personnel among publicly traded companies"
10,CTS,CTS CORP,2007-05-15,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
The following are certain risk factors that could affect ourbusiness, financial condition and operating results. These riskfactors should be considered in connection with evaluating theforward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report onForm 10-K becausethese factors could cause CTS actual results and conditionto differ materially from those projected in forward-lookingstatements. Before you invest in CTS, you should know thatmaking such an investment involves some risks, including therisks described below. The risks that are highlighted below arenot the only ones that CTS faces. If any of the following risksactually occur, CTS business, financial condition oroperating results could be negatively affected.Because CTS currently derives a significant portion of itsrevenues from a small number of customers, any decrease inorders from these customers could have an adverse effect onCTS business, financial condition and operatingresults.CTS depends on a small number of customers for a large portionof its business, and changes in the level of its customersorders have, in the past, had a significant impact on itsresults of operations. CTS 15 largest customers representa substantial portion of its sales, approximately 61% of netsales in both 2006 and 2005 and 69% of net sales in 2004.CTS two largest customers are Hewlett-Packard Company andMotorola, Inc., which represented approximately 22% and lessthan 10%, respectively, of its net sales in 2006. If a majorcustomer significantly cancels, delays or reduces the amount ofbusiness it does with CTS, there could be an adverse effect onCTS business, financial condition and operating results.Such adverse effect likely would be material if one of CTSlargest customers significantly reduced its amount of business.Significant pricing and margin pressures exerted by a keycustomer could also materially adversely affect CTSoperating results. In addition, CTS generates significantaccounts receivable from sales to its major customers. If one ormore of CTS largest customers were to become insolvent orotherwise unable to pay or were to delay payment for services,CTS business, financial condition and operating resultscould be materially adversely affected.CTS is subject to intense competition in the EMS industry.CTS competes with many providers of electronics manufacturingservices. Some of its competitors have substantially greatermanufacturing and financial resources and in some cases havemore geographically diversified international operations thanCTS. CTS large, global competitors, such as FlextronicsInternational Ltd., Solectron Corporation, Sanmina SCI Corporation, Jabil Circuit Inc., and Celestica Inc., arecompanies that often have a regional, product, service, orindustry specific focus. CTS also faces competition from themanufacturing operations of its current and future OEMcustomers, which may elect to manufacture their own productsinternally rather that outsource the manufacturing to EMSproviders. In addition, CTS also faces competition frommid-sized and smaller EMS companies such as BenchmarkElectronics Inc., Plexus Corp., Sypris Solutions Inc., LabargeInc., and Reptron Electronics Inc. Competition may intensifyfurther if more companies enter the markets in which CTSoperates. CTS failure to compete effectively couldmaterially adversely affect its business, financial conditionand operating results.CTS may be unable to compete effectively against competitorsin its Components and Sensors segment.CTS Components and Sensors segment operates in highlycompetitive industries that are characterized by price erosionand rapid technological change. CTS competes with many domesticand foreign companies, some of which have substantially greatermanufacturing, financial, research and development, andmarketing resources than CTS. Additionally, many of CTScustomers are seeking to consolidate their business among one ormore preferred or qualified suppliers. If any customer becomesdissatisfied with CTS prices, quality, or timeliness ofdelivery, among other things, it could award future business oreven move existing business to CTS competitors. Moreover,some of CTS customers could choose to manufacture anddevelop particular products themselves rather than purchase themfrom CTS. Increased competition could result in pricereductions, reduced profit margins, and loss of market share,each of which could materially adversely affect CTSbusiness, financial condition, cts corporation 9and operating results. In addition, some of CTScompetitors have engaged, and may in the future engage, inmerger and acquisition transactions. Consolidations bycompetitors are likely to create entities with increased marketshare, customer bases, proprietary technology, marketingexpertise and sales force size. These developments maymaterially adversely affect CTS ability to compete againstthese competitors. CTS cannot assure you that its products willcontinue to compete successfully with its competitorsproducts, including OEMs, many of which are significantly largerthan CTS and have greater financial and other resources than CTS.CTS may be unable to keep pace with rapid technologicalchanges that could make some of its products or processesobsolete before it realizes a return on its investment.The technologies relating to some of CTS products haveundergone, and are continuing to undergo, rapid and significantchanges. Specifically, end markets for electronic components andassemblies are characterized by technological change, frequentnew product introductions and enhancements, changes in customerrequirements and emerging industry standards. The introductionof products embodying new technologies and the emergence of newindustry standards could render CTS existing productsobsolete and unmarketable before CTS can recover any or all ofits research, development, and commercialization expenses oncapital investments. Furthermore, the life cycles of CTSproducts and the products CTS manufactures for others vary, maychange, and are difficult to estimate.CTS future success will depend upon its ability to developand introduce new products and product enhancements on a timelybasis that keep pace with technological developments andemerging industry standards and address increasinglysophisticated requirements of CTS customers. CTS hasincurred, and expects to continue to incur, expenses typical ofthe electronics industry associated with research anddevelopment activities and the introduction and promotion of newproducts. There can be no assurance that the expenses incurredwill not exceed research and development cost estimates or thatnew products will achieve market acceptance and generate salessufficient to offset development costs. CTS also cannot provideassurance that it will not experience difficulties that coulddelay or prevent the successful development, introduction andmarketing of these new products or product enhancements or thatCTS new products or product enhancements will adequatelymeet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve marketacceptance. There can be no assurance that products ortechnologies developed by others will not render CTSproducts non-competitive or obsolete. If CTS is unable, fortechnological or other reasons, to develop and market newproducts or product enhancements in a timely and cost-effectivemanner, CTS business, financial condition, and operatingresults could be materially adversely affected.CTS customers have canceled, and may in the future,cancel their orders, change production quantities, or locationsor delay production.CTS generally does not obtain firm, long-term purchasecommitments from its customers, and has often experiencedreduced lead times in customer orders. Customers cancel theirorders, change production quantities, and delay production for anumber of reasons. Uncertain economic and geopoliticalconditions have resulted, and may continue to result, in some ofCTS customers delaying the delivery of some of theproducts CTS manufactures for them and placing purchase ordersfor lower volumes of products than previously anticipated.Cancellations, reductions, or delays by a significant customeror by a group of customers have harmed, and may continue toharm, CTS results of operations by reducing the volumes ofproducts manufactured by CTS, as well as by causing a delay inthe recovery of its expenditures for inventory in preparationfor customer orders and lower asset utilization resulting inlower gross margins.In addition, customers may require that manufacturing of theirproducts be transitioned from one facility to another to achievecost and other objectives. Such transfers may result ininefficiencies and costs due to resulting excess capacity andoverhead at one facility and capacity constraints and theinability to fulfill all orders at another. In addition, CTSmakes significant decisions, including determining the levels oforders that it will seek and accept, production schedules,component procurement commitments, personnel needs and otherresource requirements, based on its estimates of customerrequirements. The short-term nature of CTS customerscommitments and the changes in demand for their products reduceCTS ability to estimate accurately future customerrequirements. This makes it difficult to schedule production andmaximize utilization of CTS manufacturing capacity.Anticipated orders may not materialize and delivery schedulesmay be deferred as a result of changes in demand for CTSproducts or its customers products. CTS often increasesstaffing and capacity, and incurs other expenses to meet theanticipated demand of its customers, which cause reductions inits gross margins if customer orders are delayed or canceled. Onoccasion, customers require rapid increases in production, whichmay stress CTS resources and reduce margins. CTS may nothave sufficient capacity at any given time to meet itscustomers demands. In addition, because many of CTScosts and operating expenses are relatively fixed over the shortterm, a reduction in customer demand harms its gross profit andoperating income until such time as adjustments can be made toactivity or operating levels and structural costs. 10  cts corporationCTS sells products to customers in cyclical industries, whichare subject to significant downturns that could materiallyadversely affect CTS business, financial condition, andoperating results.CTS sells products to customers in cyclical industries, whichhave experienced economic and industry downturns. These marketsfor CTS electronic components and sensors and electronicsmanufacturing services products have softened in the past andmay again soften in the future. CTS may face reducedend-customer demand, underutilization of CTS manufacturingcapacity, changes in CTS revenue mix, and other factorsthat could adversely affect CTS results of operations inthe near term. CTS cannot predict whether it will achieveprofitability in future periods.A deterioration of revenues and earnings could have a negativeeffect on CTS business, financial condition and operatingresults. This could also have a negative effect on the price ofCTS common stock and could also make it difficult for CTS toservice its debt. Violation of the covenants in CTS creditfacility could require substantial fees to CTS banks untilthe violation is corrected. In the event the violation cannot becorrected, all of the indebtedness under CTS creditfacility, its convertible subordinated notes, as well as certainother indebtedness, may be accelerated. If CTSindebtedness is accelerated, CTS cannot be certain that it willhave sufficient funds to pay the accelerated indebtedness orthat it will have the ability to refinance the acceleratedindebtedness on terms favorable to CTS or at all.Because CTS derives a substantial portion of its revenuesfrom customers in the automotive, computer, and communicationsindustries, it is susceptible to trends and factors affectingthose industries as well as the success of its customersproducts.Net sales to the automotive, computer, and communicationsindustries represent a substantial portion of CTSrevenues. Factors negatively affecting these industries and thedemand for products also negatively affect CTS business,financial condition, and operating results. Any adverseoccurrence, including industry slowdown, recession, politicalinstability, costly or constraining regulations, armedhostilities, terrorism, excessive inflation, prolongeddisruptions in one or more of CTS customersproduction schedules or labor disturbances, that results insignificant decline in the volume of sales in these industries,or in an overall downturn in the business and operations ofCTS customers in these industries, could materiallyadversely affect CTS business, financial condition, andoperating results. For example, the trend toward consolidationin the computer and communications industries could result in alower level of acceptance of CTS products, reduced productrequirements, purchasing delays by combined entities, or theloss of one or more customers. Also, the automotive industry isgenerally highly unionized and some of CTS customers have,in the past, experienced labor disruptions. Furthermore, theautomotive industry is highly cyclical in nature and sensitiveto changes in general economic conditions, consumer preferencesand interest rates.CTS customers are primarily OEMs in the automotive,computer, and communications industries. CTS future salesare dependent on the success of its customers. CTScustomers may discontinue or modify their products containingproducts that CTS manufactures or develop products requiring newmanufacturing processes. Some of CTS U.S. automotivecustomers face financial difficulties due to weak sales and highlabor costs, including retirement plans. In addition, thecomputer and communications industries are subject to rapidtechnological change and changes in demand for CTSproducts. If CTS customers are unable to develop productsthat keep pace with the changing technological environment, itscustomers products could lose market acceptance, and thedemand for CTS products could decline significantly. IfCTS is unable to offer technologically advanced, easilyadaptable and cost-effective products in response to changingcustomer requirements, demand for its products will decline.Products CTS manufactures may contain design or manufacturingdefects that could result in reduced demand for CTSproducts or services and liability claims against us.Despite CTS quality control and quality assurance efforts,defects may occur in the products CTS manufactures due to designor manufacturing errors or component failure. Product defectsmay result in delayed shipments and reduced demand for CTSproducts. CTS may be subject to increased costs due to warrantyclaims on defective products. Product defects may result inproduct liability claims against CTS where defects cause, or arealleged to cause, property damage, bodily injury or death. CTSmay be required to participate in a recall involving productswhich are, or are alleged to be, defective. CTS carriesinsurance for certain legal matters involving product liability,however, CTS does not have coverage for all costs related toproduct defects and the costs of such claims, including costs ofdefense and settlement, may exceed CTS available coverage.CTS is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchangerates that have adversely affected, and may continue toadversely affect, CTS business, financial condition andoperating results.CTS transacts business in various foreign countries. CTSpresents its consolidated financial statements inU.S. dollars, but a portion of CTS revenues andexpenditures are transacted in other currencies. As a result,CTS is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currencies. CTS hascurrency exposure arising from both sales and purchasesdenominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.Volatility in the exchange rates between cts corporation 11the foreign currencies and the U.S. dollar could harmCTS business, financial condition and operating results.Furthermore, to the extent CTS sells its products in foreignmarkets, currency fluctuations may result in CTS productsbecoming too expensive for foreign customers. For example,CTS EMS business located in the United Kingdom sellsprimarily in U.S. dollars while most of the operatingexpenses and some material purchases are made in UK poundsterling. Accordingly, when the U.S. dollar weakens againstthe UK pound sterling, CTS EMS segment operating resultsgenerally worsen. CTS also manufactures products in China, mostof which CTS sells in U.S. dollars. An appreciation of theChinese RMB against the U.S. dollar would increaseCTS expenses when translated into U.S. dollars.CTS operating results vary significantly from period toperiod.CTS experiences fluctuations in its operating results. Some ofthe principal factors that contribute to these fluctuations are:changes in demand for CTS products; CTSeffectiveness in managing manufacturing processes, costs, andtiming of CTS component purchases so that components areavailable when needed for production, while mitigating the risksof purchasing inventory in excess of immediate production needs;the degree to which CTS is able to utilize its availablemanufacturing capacity; changes in the cost and availability ofcomponents, which often occur in the electronics manufacturingindustry and which affect CTS margins and its ability tomeet delivery schedules; general economic and served industryconditions; local conditions and events that may affectCTS production volumes, such as labor conditions andpolitical instability.In addition, due to the significant differences in the operatingincome margins in CTS two reporting segments, the mix ofsales between CTS Components and Sensors segment andCTS EMS segment affects CTS operating results fromperiod to period. Although CTS restructuring activitiesand relocation of some of its manufacturing operations to Asiahave resulted in improved operating income margins in CTSComponents and Sensors segment, CTS can provide no assurancesthat this will continue to occur.CTS faces risks relating to its international operations.Because CTS has significant international operations, itsoperating results and financial condition could be materiallyadversely affected by economic, political, health, regulatoryand other factors existing in foreign countries in which CTSoperates. CTS international operations are subject toinherent risks, which may materially adversely affect CTS,including: political and economic instability in countries inwhich CTS products are manufactured; expropriation or theimposition of government controls; changes in governmentregulations; export license requirements; trade restrictions;earnings expatriation restrictions; exposure to different legalstandards; less favorable intellectual property laws; healthconditions and standards; currency controls; fluctuations inexchange rates; increases in the duties and taxes CTS pays; highlevels of inflation or deflation; greater difficulty incollecting CTS accounts receivable and longer paymentcycles; changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffingand managing CTS international operations; limitations oninsurance coverage against geopolitical risks, natural disastersand business operations; communication among and management ofinternational operations. In addition, these same factors mayalso place CTS at a competitive disadvantage to some ofCTS foreign competitors.To respond to competitive pressures and customer requirements,CTS may further expand internationally at low cost locations,particularly in Asia. If CTS continues to expand in theselocations, CTS may incur additional capital expenditures. CTScannot assure you that it will realize the anticipated strategicbenefits of CTS international operations or that itsinternational operations will contribute positively to, and notadversely affect, CTS business, financial condition andoperating results.Furthermore, because a significant portion of CTS productsare manufactured in Asia, including China, Singapore, Taiwan andThailand, any conflict or uncertainty in these countries,including public health or safety concerns, such as Severe AcuteRespiratory Syndrome, or natural disasters, such as earthquakes,could have a material adverse effect on CTS business,financial condition and operating results. In addition, if thegovernment of any country in which CTS products aremanufactured or sold sets technical standards for products madein or imported into their country that are not widely shared,some of CTS customers may suspend imports of theirproducts into that country, require manufacturers in thatcountry to manufacture products with different technicalstandards or disrupt cross-border manufacturing partnerships,which, in each case, could materially adversely affect CTSbusiness, financial condition and operating results.CTS may further restructure its operations, which maymaterially adversely affect CTS business, financialcondition and operating results.In 2006, CTS consolidated its Berne, Indiana manufacturingoperations into three of its other existing facilities. Theconsolidation resulted in pre-tax restructuring charge andrestructuring-related costs of approximately $4.0 million.CTS may incur additional restructuring and impairment charges inthe future if circumstances warrant. If CTS restructures itsoperations in the future and is unsuccessful in implementingrestructuring plans, CTS may experience disruptions in itsoperations and higher ongoing costs, which may materiallyadversely affect CTS business, financial condition andoperating results. 12  cts corporationCTS may explore acquisitions that complement or expandCTS business as well as divestitures of various businessoperations. CTS may not be able to complete these transactionsand these transactions, if executed, could pose significantrisks and may materially adversely affect CTS business,financial condition and operating results.CTS intends to explore opportunities to buy other businesses ortechnologies that could complement, enhance, or expand CTScurrent business or product lines or that might otherwise offerCTS growth opportunities. CTS may have difficulty finding theseopportunities or, if CTS does identify these opportunities, CTSmay not be able to complete the transactions for reasonsincluding a failure to secure financing. Any transactions thatCTS is able to identify and complete may involve a number ofrisks, including: the diversion of CTS managementsattention from CTS existing business to integrate theoperations and personnel of the acquired or combined business orjoint venture; possible adverse effects on CTS operatingresults during the integration process; and CTS possibleinability to achieve the intended objectives of the transaction.In addition, CTS may not be able to successfully or profitablyintegrate, operate, maintain, and manage CTS newlyacquired operations or employees. CTS may not be able tomaintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies,and this may lead to operational inefficiencies. In addition,future acquisitions may result in dilutive issuances of equitysecurities or the incurrence of additional debt.CTS has in the past, and may in the future, consider divestingcertain business operations. Divestitures may involve a numberof risks, including the diversion of managementsattention, significant costs and expenses, the loss of customerrelationships and cash flow, and the disruption of operations inthe affected business. Failure to timely complete a divestitureor to consummate a divestiture may negatively affect valuationof the affected business or result in restructuring charges.If CTS is unable to protect its intellectual property or itinfringes, or is alleged to infringe, on another personsintellectual property, CTS business, financial conditionand operating results could be materially adversely affected.The success of CTS business depends, in part, uponCTS ability to protect trade secrets, copyrights andpatents, obtain or license patents and operate withoutinfringing on the intellectual property rights of others. CTSrelies on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, patents,nondisclosure agreements, and technical measures to protectCTS proprietary rights in its products and technology. Thesteps taken by CTS in this regard may not be adequate to preventmisappropriation of CTS technology. In addition, the lawsof some foreign countries in which CTS operates do not protectCTS proprietary rights to the same extent as do the lawsof the United States. Although CTS continues to evaluate andimplement protective measures, there can be no assurance thatthese efforts will be successful. CTS inability to protectits intellectual property rights could diminish or eliminate thecompetitive advantages that CTS derives from its technology,cause CTS to lose sales or otherwise harm CTS business.CTS believes that patents will continue to play a role in itsbusiness. However, there can be no assurance that it will besuccessful in securing patents for claims in any pending patentapplication or that any issued patent will provide CTS with anycompetitive advantage. CTS also cannot provide assurance thatthe patents will not be challenged by third parties or that thepatents of others will not materially adversely affect CTSability to do business.CTS may become involved in litigation in the future to protectits intellectual property or because others may allege that CTSinfringes on their intellectual property. These claims and anyresulting lawsuit could subject CTS to liability for damages andinvalidate CTS intellectual property rights. If aninfringement claim is successfully asserted by a holder ofintellectual property rights, CTS may be required to ceasemarketing or selling certain products, pay a penalty for pastinfringement, and spend significant time and money to develop anon-infringing product or process or to obtain licenses for thetechnology, process or information from the holder. CTS may notbe successful in the development of a non-infringingalternative, or licenses may not be available on commerciallyacceptable terms, if at all, in which case CTS may lose salesand profits. In addition, any litigation could be lengthy andcostly and could materially adversely affect CTS even if CTS issuccessful in the litigation.CTS may experience shortages and increased costs of rawmaterial and required electronic components.In the past, from time to time, there have been shortages incertain raw materials used in the manufacture of CTScomponents and sensors and certain electronic componentspurchased by CTS and incorporated into assemblies andsubassemblies. Unanticipated raw material or electroniccomponent shortages may prevent CTS from making scheduledshipments to customers. CTS inability to make scheduledshipments could cause CTS to experience a shortfall in revenue,increase CTS costs, and adversely affect CTSrelationship with affected customers and CTS reputation asa reliable service provider. CTS may be required to pay higherprices for raw materials or electronic components in shortsupply and order these raw materials or electronic components ingreater quantities to compensate for variable delivery times.CTS may also be required to pay higher prices for raw materialsor electronic components due to inflationary trends regardlessof supply. As a result, raw material or electronic componentshortages and price increases could adversely affect CTSoperating results for a particular period due to the resultingrevenue shortfall and increased costs. cts corporation 13Loss of CTS key management and other personnel, or aninability to attract key management and other personnel, couldmaterially affect CTS business.CTS depends on its senior executive officers and other keypersonnel to run its business. CTS does not have long-termretention contracts with many of its key personnel. The loss ofany of these officers or other key personnel could adverselyaffect CTS operations. Competition for qualified employeesamong companies that rely heavily on engineering and technologyis at times intense, and the loss of qualified employees or aninability to attract, retain and motivate additional highlyskilled employees required for the operation and expansion ofCTS business could hinder CTS ability to conductresearch activities successfully and develop marketable products.CTS is subject to a variety of environmental laws andregulations that expose CTS to potential financial liability.CTS operations are regulated by a number of federal,state, local, and foreign environmental and safety laws andregulations that govern, among other things, the discharge ofhazardous materials into the air and water as well as thehandling, storage and disposal of these materials. These lawsand regulations include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act,the Resource, Conservation and Recovery Act and theComprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and LiabilityAct, as well as analogous state and foreign laws. Compliancewith these environmental laws is a major consideration for CTSbecause it uses hazardous materials in its manufacturingprocesses. If CTS violates environmental laws or regulations,CTS could be held liable for substantial fines, damages, andcosts of remedial actions. CTS environmental permits couldalso be revoked or modified, which could require CTS to cease orlimit production at one or more of its facilities, therebymaterially adversely affecting CTS business, financialcondition and operating results. Environmental laws andrequirements, including environmental laws in the European Unionand other foreign jurisdictions, have generally become morestringent over time and could continue to do so, imposinggreater compliance costs and increasing risks and penaltiesassociated with any violation, which also could materiallyaffect CTS business, financial condition and operatingresults.In addition, because CTS is a generator of hazardous wastes,even if CTS fully complies with applicable environmental lawsand requirements, CTS may be subject to financial exposure forcosts, including costs of investigation and any remediation,associated with contaminated sites at which hazardous substancesfrom CTS operations have been stored, treated or disposedof. CTS may also be subject to exposure for such costs at sitesthat CTS currently owns or operates or formerly owned oroperated. Such exposure may be joint and several, so that CTSmay be held responsible for more than its share of thecontamination or even for the entire contamination.CTS has been notified by the Environmental Protection Agency,state environmental agencies and, in some cases, generatorgroups that CTS is or may be a potentially responsible partyregarding hazardous substances at several sites not owned oroperated by CTS, as well as several sites that CTS owns.Although CTS estimates its potential liability with respect toenvironmental violations or alleged violations and otherenvironmental liabilities and reserves for such matters, CTScannot assure you that its reserves will be sufficient to coverthe actual costs that it incurs as a result of these matters.CTS also cannot assure you that additional contamination willnot be found in the future, either at sites currently known toCTS or at other sites. Any liability CTS may have for suchmatters could materially adversely affect CTS business,financial condition and operating results.CTS indebtedness may adversely affect its financialhealth.As of December 31, 2006, CTS long-term debt balancewas $60.8 million, consisting of $60.0 million of2.125% convertible senior subordinated notes, and$0.8 million of borrowings under a foreign credit facility.The level of CTS indebtedness could, among other things:increase CTS vulnerability to general economic andindustry conditions, including recessions; require CTS to usecash flows from operations to service its indebtedness, therebyreducing its ability to fund working capital, capitalexpenditures, research and development efforts and otherexpenses; limit CTS flexibility in planning for, orreacting to, changes in its business and the industries in whichit operates; place CTS at a competitive disadvantage compared tocompetitors that have less indebtedness; limit CTS abilityto borrow additional funds that may be needed to operate andexpand its business.CTS credit facility and the indenture governingCTS convertible senior subordinated notes containprovisions that could materially restrict CTS business.CTS credit facility contains a number of significantcovenants that, among other things, limit CTS ability to:dispose of assets; incur certain additional debt; repay otherdebt or amend subordinated debt instruments; create liens onassets; make investments, loans or advances; make acquisitionsor engage in mergers or consolidations; and engage in certaintransactions with CTS subsidiaries and affiliates. UnderCTS credit facility, CTS is required to meet certainfinancial ratios. In addition, the indenture governing CTS2.125% convertible senior subordinated notes provides foran adjustment of the conversion rate if CTS pays dividends overa certain amount or makes other distributions on capital stockand limits CTS ability to engage in mergers orconsolidations. 14  cts corporationThe restrictions contained in CTS credit facility and inthe indenture governing CTS convertible seniorsubordinated notes could limit CTS ability to plan for orreact to market conditions or meet capital needs or couldotherwise restrict CTS activities or business plans. Theserestrictions could adversely affect CTS ability to financeits operations, strategic acquisitions, investments or othercapital needs or to engage in other business activities thatcould be in CTS interests.CTS ability to comply with these covenants may be affectedby events beyond its control. If CTS breaches any of thesecovenants or restrictions, it could result in an event ofdefault under CTS credit facility, the indenture governingCTS convertible senior subordinated notes, or documentsgoverning any other existing or future indebtedness. A default,if not cured or waived, may permit acceleration of CTSindebtedness. In addition, CTS lenders could terminatetheir commitments to make further extensions of credit underCTS credit facility. If CTS indebtedness isaccelerated, CTS cannot be certain that it will have sufficientfunds to pay the accelerated indebtedness or that it will havethe ability to refinance accelerated indebtedness on termsfavorable to CTS or at all.Anti-takeover provisions could delay, deter or prevent achange in control of CTS even if the change in control would bebeneficial to CTS shareholders.CTS is an Indiana corporation subject to Indiana state law. Someprovisions of Indiana law could interfere with or restricttakeover bids or other change in control events affecting CTS.One statutory provision prohibits, except under specifiedcircumstances, CTS from engaging in any mergers, sale of assets,recapitalizations and reverse stock splits with any shareholderwho owns 10% or more of CTS common stock or any affiliate of theshareholder. Also, provisions in CTS articles ofincorporation, bylaws, and other agreements to which CTS is aparty could delay, deter or prevent a change in control of CTS,even if a change in control would be beneficial to shareholders.CTS has opted out of Indianas control shareacquisition provisions, which restrict the voting rightsof shares acquired in transactions which cause the beneficialowner of the shares to exceed specified ownership thresholds.CTS could, however, by action of its board of directors, electto have those provisions apply.In addition, CTS has a shareholder rights agreement that undercertain circumstances would significantly impair the ability ofthird parties to acquire control of CTS without prior approvalof CTS board of directors. In addition, CTS articlesof incorporation allow it to issue up to an additional21.4 million shares of common stock and 25.0 millionshares of preferred stock without shareholder approval.CTS board of directors has the authority to determine theprice and terms under which the additional common or preferredstock may be issued. Issuance of this common and preferred stockcould make it more difficult for a third party to acquirecontrol of CTS.The Moorpark and Santa Clara accounting investigation andrestatements may harm CTS business in the future.In February 2007, CTS management commenced aninvestigation of accounting entries at its Moorpark and SantaClara, California manufacturing locations which was acquired inthe SMTEK acquisition in January 2005. The investigationdetermined that the Moorpark controller made numerous incorrectaccounting entries beginning in 2005 and continuing through2006. These entries transferred significant costs from incomestatement accounts, primarily cost of goods sold, to balancesheet accounts, primarily accounts payable.As a result of the errors, CTS restated its condensedconsolidated financial statements for each of the first threequarters of 2006, reducing its net income by $1.9 million,or $0.05 per diluted share for the nine months endedOctober 1, 2006, and its consolidated financial statementsfor 2005, reducing its full year net income by$1.5 million, or $0.04 per diluted share.CTS has incurred substantial expenses for legal and accountingservices due to the investigation of these misstatements and therestatement of its financial statements. In addition, theseactivities have diverted CTS managements attention fromthe conduct of its business. The diversion of resources toaddress issues arising out of the investigation and financialrestatement may harm CTS business, operating results andfinancial condition in the future.CTS failure to maintain effective internal control overfinancial reporting may be insufficient to allow it toaccurately report its financial results or prevent fraud, whichcould cause its financial statements to become materiallymisleading and adversely affect the trading price of its commonstock.CTS requires effective internal control over financial reportingin order to provide reasonable assurance with respect to itsfinancial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. Internalcontrol over financial reporting may not prevent or detectmisstatements because of its inherent limitations, including thepossibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding ofcontrols, or fraud. Therefore, even effective internal controlscan provide only reasonable assurance with respect to thepreparation and fair presentation of financial statements. IfCTS cannot provide reasonable assurance with respect to itsfinancial statements and effectively prevent fraud, itsfinancial statements could become materially misleading, whichcould adversely affect the trading price of CTS commonstock. cts corporation 15CTS management determined that the misstatements in theMoorpark and Santa Clara accounts reflected a material weaknessin its internal control over financial reporting. CTS isenhancing its internal controls in order to remediate thematerial weakness. Implementing new internal controls andtesting the internal control framework will require thededication of additional resources, management time and expense.If CTS fails to maintain the adequacy of its internal controlover financial reporting, including any failure to implementrequired new or improved controls, or if CTS experiencesdifficulties in their implementation, its business, financialcondition and operating results could be harmed.Delays in filing periodic reports and financial restatementsmay adversely affect CTS stock price.In 2007, CTS stock price varied from a high of $16.18 onJanuary 17, 2007 prior to CTS announcement that itwould delay the release of fiscal year 2006 earnings to a low of$13.00 on April 11, 2007, following CTS announcementon February 9, 2007, that its 2006 consolidated financialstatements could no longer be relied upon. CTS failed to fileits Annual Report onForm 10-K withinthe time required by Securities and Exchange Commissionregulations. In addition, CTS will not be able to timely fileits Quarterly Report onForm 10-Q for thequarter ended April 1, 2007. CTS financialrestatements and related disclosures in this and other filingsmay harm investor confidence and negatively affect CTSstock price. In addition, CTS failure to timely fileperiodic reports may adversely affect its stock price"
