  We operate globally in a rapidly changing economic, political and technological environment that present numerous risks. Our operations and financial results are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, our ability to successfully execute our strategy and the trading price of our common stock or debt. The following discussion identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect the Company. This information should be read in conjunction with Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this report. The following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider, as these factors could cause our future results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements and from historical trends. Risks Related to Our Business Inflationary price pressures and uncertain availability of commodities, raw materials, utilities, labor or other inputs used by us and our suppliers, or instability in logistics and related costs, among other factors, could negatively impact our profitability  Increases in the price of commodities, raw materials, utilities, labor or other inputs that we or our suppliers use in manufacturing and supplying products, components and parts, along with logistics and other related costs, may lead to higher production and shipping costs for our products, parts and components. Further, increasing global demand for, and uncertain supply of, such materials could disrupt our or our suppliers’ ability to obtain such materials in a timely manner to meet our supply needs and/or could lead to increased costs. Any increase in the cost of inputs to our production could lead to higher costs for our products and could negatively impact our operating results, future profitability and ability to successfully deliver on our strategy. Increasing our prices to our customers may cause certain of our customers to push out, cancel or refrain from purchasing our products, which could materially adversely impact demand for our products, and thereby also negatively impact our operating results, future profitability and ability to successfully deliver on our strategy. Factors such as supply chain disruptions, manufacturing interruptions or delays, or the failure to accurately forecast customer demand, could affect our ability to meet customer demand, lead to higher costs, or result in excess or obsolete inventory; if we are unable to obtain the necessary equipment, raw and batch materials, natural resources, utilities and other essentials required in our products or processes, our business will be negatively impacted Corning’s business relies on the timely supply of raw materials, precious metals, natural resources or utilities including energy and industrial water, equipment, parts and components, services and related products to meet the changing technical and volume requirements of its customers, which depends in part on the timely delivery of materials, equipment and services, from suppliers and contract manufacturers. Significant or sudden increases in demand for such materials, equipment and services, as well as delays in and unpredictability of shipments due to transportation interruptions, have resulted in, and may continue to result in, a shortage of materials, equipment and services needed to manufacture Corning’s products. Such shortages have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our suppliers’ ability to meet our demand requirements and Corning’s manufacturing operations and its ability to meet customer demand. Some key materials, equipment and services are subject to long lead-times or are available only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers and we may not be able to find alternate sources in a timely manner. Volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment can increase capital, technical, operational and other risks for Corning and for companies throughout our supply chain, and may cause some suppliers to exit businesses, scale back or cease operations, which could impact our ability to meet customer demand and could have a material adverse effect on our business.        13     Table of Contents Corning may also experience significant interruptions of its manufacturing operations, delays in its ability to deliver products or services, increased costs or customer order cancellations as a result of:  •  The failure or inability to accurately forecast demand and obtain sufficient quantities of materials, equipment and services on a cost-effective basis; •Volatility in the availability and cost of materials, equipment and services, including rising prices due to inflation or scarcity of availability;•Difficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export approvals;•Shipment delays due to transportation interruptions or capacity constraints;•A worldwide shortage of semiconductor components or other issues;•Information technology or infrastructure failures, including those of a third-party supplier or service provider; and•Natural disasters, the impacts of climate change, or other events beyond Corning’s control (such as earthquakes, utility interruptions, tsunamis, hurricanes, typhoons, floods, storms or extreme weather conditions, fires, regional economic downturns, regional or global health crisis events, geopolitical turmoil, increased trade restrictions between the U.S. and China and other countries, social unrest, political instability, terrorism, or acts of war) in locations where it or its customers or suppliers have manufacturing, research, engineering or other operations. Health crisis events, such as epidemics or pandemics, have adversely impacted, and may continue to impact, the economy and disrupt our operations and supply chains, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations Health crisis events, including epidemics or pandemics, such as COVID-19, have impacted and may further impact the economy and could have additional impacts on economic growth, supply chains, the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Recently, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in authorities around the world implementing numerous unprecedented measures such as travel restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, vaccine mandates and facility shutdowns. These measures have impacted our workforce, operations and supply chains, and those of our customers, contract manufacturers and suppliers, and may continue to have an impact particularly in the event of another significant global health crisis. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the duration, scope and severity of a health crisis event and the impacts on our business and the economy from the effects of such an event and response measures.   Corning’s Display Technologies segment generates a significant amount of the Company’s profits and cash flow; any significant decrease in display glass pricing, volume or market share could have a material and negative impact on our financial results Corning’s ability to generate profits and operating cash flow depends largely on the profitability of our display glass business, which is subject to pricing pressure, exchange rate movements, industry competition, potential over-capacity, development of new technologies and operational and regulatory risks. If we are not able to achieve proportionate reductions in costs and/or increases in volume or price to offset the aforementioned factors, it could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. Because we have a concentrated customer base, future sales and cash flows could be negatively impacted by the actions or loss of one or more key customers A relatively small number of end customers account for a high percentage of our net sales.  This concentration subjects us to a variety of risks including:  •  The loss or insolvency of one or more of our key customers, could result in a substantial loss of sales and reduction in anticipated cash flows;  •  Customers may possess substantial leverage in negotiating contractual obligations, including liability provisions; and  •Mergers and consolidations between customers could result in further concentration of the customer base.       14     Table of Contents The following table details the number of combined customers of our reportable segments that accounted for a large percentage of segment net sales:   Number of combined end customers   % of total segment net sales in 2023   Optical Communications   2   21% Display Technologies   3   44% Specialty Materials   2   44% Environmental Technologies   3   68% Life Sciences   2   41% Events outside of Corning’s control, or those of our contract manufacturers, could cause a disruption to our manufacturing operations and our ability to serve our customers, resulting in a negative impact to Corning’s net sales, net income, asset values and liquidity Disruption to our manufacturing operations, or those of our contract manufacturers, could significantly impact Corning’s ability to supply its customers and could produce a near-term severe impact on our individual business units and the Company. Given the geographical concentration of certain of the Company’s and our contract manufacturers’ plants in Asia Pacific, the highly engineered nature of the facilities and the globally dispersed talent required to run these facilities, any event that adversely affects or restricts movement into or out of a specific geographic area where we, our contract manufacturers, suppliers, or customers have a presence, could adversely impact our results. Due to the specialized nature of our products and single-site manufacturing locations, in the event such a location experiences disruption, it may not be possible to find replacement capacity or substitute production from other facilities.  We may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights, which could result in loss of market share and decreased sales and profits, and we may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others We rely on patent and trade secret laws, copyright, trademark, confidentiality procedures, controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights. Despite our efforts, these protections may be limited and we may encounter difficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights or obtaining rights to additional intellectual property necessary to permit us to continue or expand our businesses. We cannot provide assurance that the patents we hold or may obtain will provide meaningful protection against our competitors. Changes in or enforcement of laws concerning intellectual property may affect our ability to prevent or address the misappropriation of, or the unauthorized use of, our intellectual property, potentially resulting in loss of market share. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights. Litigation is inherently uncertain and outcomes are unpredictable. If we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use, or other misappropriation, we may not remain competitive. The intellectual property rights of others could inhibit our ability to introduce new products. Other companies hold patents on technologies used in our industries and are aggressively seeking to expand, enforce and license their patent portfolios. We periodically receive notices from, or have lawsuits filed against us, by third parties claiming infringement, misappropriation or other misuse of their intellectual property rights and/or breach of our agreements with them. These third parties often include entities that do not have the capabilities to design, manufacture, or distribute products or entities that acquire intellectual property, including patents, for the sole purpose of monetizing their acquired intellectual property through asserting claims of infringement and misuse. Such claims of infringement or misappropriation may result in loss of revenue, substantial costs, or lead to monetary damages or injunctive relief against us.  Information technology dependency and cybersecurity vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, liability claims, competitive or reputational harm, and result in material adverse effects on our operations and financial results The Company is dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure (“IT systems”) owned and operated by the Company or managed by third-party service providers, suppliers and contract manufacturers. IT systems enable us to conduct, monitor and/or protect our business, operations, systems, data and other assets. In the ordinary course of our business, we and our providers collect, process, transmit and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information.  Intrusion into a supplier or contract manufacturer system not integrated with a Corning IT system could result in service disruption and/or loss of financial control.         15     Table of Contents Our IT systems, and those of our providers, may be vulnerable to compromise or disruption due to human error or malfeasance, outdated applications, computer viruses or malware (e.g., ransomware), natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyber-attacks and other similar incidents and disruptions. Inadequate account security or organizational security practices may also result in unauthorized access. Increased work-from-home, at both the Company and our providers, presents additional operational risk.  Companies that provide utilities, water, transportation, natural gas and other resources and services across our supply chain, are critical to our manufacturing operations and are vulnerable to cyber-attacks. From time to time, both we and certain of our providers, have been subject to cyberattacks and security incidents.  We may be unable to anticipate, detect, prevent or remediate future attacks, particularly as attackers are becoming more sophisticated in their ability to circumvent controls and remove forensic evidence. Any significant disruption, breakdown, intrusion, interruption or corruption, data breach, or compromise to the accessibility, security or integrity of our or our providers’ IT systems, or the misappropriation or disclosure of any confidential, proprietary or personally identifiable information, could result in the loss of data or intellectual property, equipment or systems damage, downtime, safety related issues and could have a material adverse effect on our business, including by harming our competitive position and reputation, disrupting our manufacturing, reducing the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives, impairing our ability to access suppliers, contract manufacturers, customers and cloud-based services, subjecting us to litigation or regulatory investigations or fines, increasing the costs of compliance and remediation, or otherwise adversely affecting our business.  We may be required to invest significant additional resources to comply with evolving cybersecurity regulations and to modify and enhance our IT systems, information security and controls, and to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities. Any losses, costs or liabilities may not be covered by, or may exceed the coverage limits of, any, or all, of our applicable insurance policies.  We may not earn a positive return from our research, development and engineering investments  Developing our products through our innovation model of research and development is costly and often involves a long investment cycle. We make significant investments in research, development and engineering that may not earn an economic return. If our investments do not provide a pipeline of products or technologies that our customers demand or lower our manufacturing costs, or if our products or technologies become obsolete or disrupted by emerging technologies, it could negatively impact our revenue and operating margins for both near- and long-term. Our innovation model depends on our ability to attract and retain specialized expertise Our innovation model requires us to employ highly specialized experts in glass science, ceramic science and optical physics to conduct our research and development and engineer our products and design our manufacturing facilities. The loss of the services of any member of our key research and development or engineering team without adequate replacement, or the inability to attract new qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance. We are subject to strict environmental regulations and regulatory changes that could result in fines or restrictions that interrupt our operations Some of our manufacturing processes generate chemical waste, wastewater, other industrial waste or greenhouse gases, and we are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of such substances. We have installed anti-pollution equipment for the treatment of chemical waste and wastewater at our facilities. We have taken steps to control and reduce the amount of greenhouse gases created by our manufacturing operations. However, we cannot provide assurance that environmental claims will not be brought against us or that government regulators will not take steps to adopt more stringent environmental standards. Any failure on our part to comply with any present or future environmental regulations could result in the assessment of damages or imposition of fines against us, or the suspension/cessation of production or operations. In addition, environmental regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment, incur other significant compliance expenses or limit or restrict production or operations and thus materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. Changes in regulations and the regulatory environment in the U.S. and the many other countries in which we operate, such as those resulting from the regulation and impact of climate change, CO2 abatement and emission reduction targets, may affect our businesses and results in adverse ways by, among other things, substantially increasing manufacturing costs, limiting availability of scarce resources, especially energy, or requiring limitations on production or sales of our products or those of our customers.       16     Table of Contents General Risk Factors
 We may have additional tax liabilities We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions and are commonly audited by various tax authorities. There are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax treatment is uncertain. Judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax, assessments, audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals, or result in the forfeiture of funds deposited with the relevant government authorities. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which such a determination is made.   The U.S., other countries and international organizations, such as Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, may change their laws or issue new international tax standards that may also impact our taxes.  As a global company, we face many risks which could adversely impact our operations and financial results  We are a global company and derive a substantial portion of our revenue from, and have significant operations, outside of the U.S. Our international operations include manufacturing, assembly, sales, research and development, customer support and shared administrative service centers. Additionally, we rely on a global supply chain for key components and capabilities that are central to our ability to invent, make and sell products. Compliance with multiple legal and regulatory requirements increases our costs. We are subject to both U.S. laws and the local laws where we operate which, among other things, include data privacy requirements, employment and labor laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, prohibitions on payments to governmental officials, import and trade restrictions and export requirements. Non-compliance or violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Such violations could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our businesses and operating results. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and manage these risks. Corning is exposed to risks associated with an uncertain, recessionary and inflationary global economy Uncertain or adverse economic and business conditions, including uncertainties and volatility in the financial markets, national debt, fiscal or monetary concerns, availability of government incentives, inflation and rising interest rates in various regions, could materially adversely impact Corning’s operating results. Markets for our products depend largely on business and consumer spending and demand for network capacity, electronics and automotive products. Uncertain or adverse economic and recessionary business conditions, among other factors, that could result in decreases in consumer spending and demand, or cause us to pass on increased costs to our customers, may cause certain of our customers to push out, cancel or refrain from purchasing our products, which could materially adversely impact demand for our products and our operating results. Similarly, changes that result in sudden increases in consumer demand for electronic products have resulted in, and may continue to result in, a shortage of parts and materials needed to manufacture our products or the products in which our products are used. Such shortages, as well as shipment delays due to transportation interruptions, have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our ability to meet our demand requirements. Uncertain economic and industry conditions also make it more challenging for Corning to forecast its operating results, make business decisions and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect its businesses, sources and uses of cash, financial condition and results of operations. If Corning does not appropriately manage its business operations in response to changing economic and industry conditions, it could have a significant negative impact on its business performance and financial condition. Even during periods of economic uncertainty or lower revenues, Corning must continue to invest in research and development and maintain a global business infrastructure to compete effectively and support its customers, which can have a negative impact on its operating margins and earnings.       17     Table of Contents We are also subject to a variety of other risks in managing a global organization, including those related to:  •  The economic and political conditions in each country or region and relationships among countries;  •  Complex regulatory requirements affecting international trade and investment, including anti-dumping laws, export controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local laws prohibiting improper payments. Our operations may be adversely affected by changes in the substance or enforcement of these regulatory requirements, and by actual or alleged violations of them;  •  Fluctuations in currency exchange rates, convertibility of currencies and restrictions involving the movement of funds between jurisdictions and countries;  •  Governmental protectionist policies and sovereign and political risks that may adversely affect Corning’s profitability and assets;  •  Tariffs, trade duties and other trade barriers including anti-dumping and countervailing duties;  •  Geographical concentration of our factories and operations, and regional shifts in our customer base;  •  Health crisis events, including epidemic or pandemic concerns;  •  Political unrest, geopolitical tensions, confiscation or expropriation of assets by foreign governments, terrorism and the potential for other hostilities;  •  Difficulty in protecting intellectual property, sensitive commercial and operations data and information technology systems;  •  Differing legal systems, including protection and treatment of intellectual property and patents;  •  Complex, changing or competing tax regimes;  •  Difficulty in collecting obligations owed to us;  •  Natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, tsunamis and windstorms; and  •  Potential loss of utilities or other disruptions affecting manufacturing.  We have significant exposure to foreign currency movements  A large portion of our sales, profit and cash flows are transacted in non-U.S. dollar currencies, primarily the Japanese yen, South Korean won, New Taiwan dollar, Chinese yuan and euro. The Company expects to continue to experience fluctuations in the U.S. dollar value of these activities if it is not possible, cost-effective or should we not elect to hedge certain currency exposure. Additionally, gains or losses may be experienced if the underlying exposure which has been hedged increases or decreases significantly. The ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency exposure that we have, the changes in exchange rates associated with those exposures, whether we have entered into foreign currency contracts to offset these exposures and other factors.  These factors could materially impact our results of operations, anticipated future results, financial position and cash flows. We may have significant exposure to counterparties of our related derivatives portfolio  We maintain a significant portfolio of over-the-counter derivatives to hedge our projected currency exposure. We are exposed to potential losses in the event of non-performance by our counterparties to these derivative contracts. Any failure of a counterparty to pay on such a contract when due could materially impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Current or future litigation or regulatory investigations may harm our financial condition or results of operations As a global technology and manufacturing company, we are engaged in various litigations and regulatory matters. Litigation and regulatory proceedings may be uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, resulting in significant liabilities, penalties or damages. Any such substantial legal liability or regulatory action could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and reputation.       18     Table of Contents Our business is subject to various governmental regulations, and compliance with these regulations may cause us to incur significant expense. If we fail to maintain compliance with applicable regulations, we may be forced to cease the manufacture and distribution of certain products, and we could be subject to administrative proceedings and civil or criminal penalties Our products and operations are also subject to regulation by U.S. and non‐U.S. regulatory agencies, such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. From time to time, we may also be involved or required to participate in regulatory investigations or inquiries, into certain of our contracting and business practices, which may evolve into legal or other administrative proceedings. Growing public concern over concentration of economic power in corporations is likely to result in increased anti‐competition legislation, regulation, administrative rule making and enforcement activity. Involvement in regulatory investigations or inquiries, can be costly, lengthy, complex and time consuming, diverting the attention and energies of our management and technical personnel.  If any pending or future governmental investigations result in an unfavorable resolution, we could be required to cease the manufacture and sale of the subject products or technology, pay fines or disgorge profits or other payments and/or cease certain conduct and/or modify our contracting or business practices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may be obligated to indemnify our current or former directors or employees, or former directors or employees of companies that we have acquired, in connection with regulatory investigations. These liabilities could be substantial and may include, among other things, the cost of government, law enforcement or regulatory investigations and civil or criminal fines and penalties. Our global operations are subject to extensive trade and anti-corruption laws and regulations Due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of import- and export-related laws and regulations, including U.S. regulations issued by Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and Security, the Office of Anti-boycott Compliance, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and the Office of Foreign Assets Control, as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries. Any alleged or actual violation by an employee or the Company may subject us to government scrutiny, investigation and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the U.S. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject to, based on the way existing laws might be administered or interpreted. In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials to obtain or retain business or obtain an unfair advantage. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Our continued operation and expansion outside the U.S., including in developing countries, could increase the risk of alleged violations. Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition. Moreover, several of our key customers are domiciled in areas of the world with laws, rules and business practices that may notably differ from those in the U.S., and we face the reputational and legal risk that our related partners may violate applicable laws, rules and business practices. International trade policies may negatively impact our ability to sell and manufacture our products outside of the U.S. Government policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas, tariffs and capital controls, whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs, can affect the demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us, our equity affiliates or joint ventures, from being able to sell and manufacture products in certain countries. The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as higher tariffs or new barriers to entry, together with anti-dumping claims, duties, slowed regulatory approvals and other restrictions, in countries in which we import raw materials and components or sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, a country’s adoption of nationalistic policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations.  Further, these actions in conjunction with any trade tensions may restrict us from participating in a specific market or may prevent us from competing effectively.       19     Table of Contents    "

  We operate in rapidly changing economic, political and technological environments that present numerous risks. Our operations and financial results are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, our ability to successfully execute our strategy and the trading price of our common stock or debt. The following discussion identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect the Company. This information should be read in conjunction with Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this report. The following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider, as these factors could cause our future results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements and from historical trends. Risks Related to Our Business The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and may continue to impact, the global economy and disrupt our operations and supply chains, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations COVID-19 has impacted and may further impact the global economy and could have additional impacts on economic growth, the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The pandemic has resulted in authorities around the world implementing numerous unprecedented measures such as travel restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, vaccine mandates and facility shutdowns. These measures have impacted, and may continue to impact our workforce, operations and supply chains, and those of our customers, contract manufacturers and suppliers, particularly in the event of a significant global resurgence of the illness or similar global health crisis. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the duration, scope and severity of the pandemic and the impacts on our business and the global economy from the effects of the ongoing pandemic and response measures.   Inflationary price pressures and uncertain availability of commodities, raw materials, utilities, labor or other inputs used by us and our suppliers, or instability in logistics and related costs, among other factors, could negatively impact our profitability  Increases in the price of commodities, raw materials, utilities, labor or other inputs that we or our suppliers use in manufacturing and supplying products, components and parts, along with logistics and other related costs, may lead to higher production and shipping costs for our products, parts and components. Further, increasing global demand for, and uncertain supply of, such materials could disrupt our or our suppliers’ ability to obtain such materials in a timely manner to meet our supply needs and/or could lead to increased costs. Any increase in the cost of inputs to our production could lead to higher costs for our products and could negatively impact our operating results, future profitability and ability to successfully deliver on our strategy. Increasing our prices to our customers may cause certain of our customers to push out, cancel or refrain from purchasing our products, which could materially adversely impact demand for our products, and thereby also negatively impact our operating results, future profitability and ability to successfully deliver on our strategy. Factors such as supply chain disruptions, manufacturing interruptions or delays, or the failure to accurately forecast customer demand, could affect our ability to meet customer demand, lead to higher costs, or result in excess or obsolete inventory; if we are unable to obtain the necessary equipment, raw and batch materials, natural resources, utilities and other essentials required in our products or processes, our business will be negatively impacted Corning’s business relies on the timely supply of materials, equipment, services and related products to meet the changing technical and volume requirements of its customers, which depends in part on the timely delivery of materials, equipment and services, from suppliers and contract manufacturers. Significant or sudden increases in demand for such materials, equipment and services, as well as delays in and unpredictability of shipments due to transportation interruptions, have resulted in, and may continue to result in, a shortage of materials, equipment and services needed to manufacture Corning’s products. Such shortages have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our suppliers’ ability to meet our demand requirements and Corning’s manufacturing operations and its ability to meet customer demand. Some key materials, equipment and services are subject to long lead-times or are available only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers and we may not be able to find alternate sources in a timely manner. Volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment can increase capital, technical, operational and other risks for Corning and for companies throughout our supply chain, and may cause some suppliers to exit businesses, scale back or cease operations, which could impact our ability to meet customer demand.         13     Table of Contents Our ability to meet customer demand depends, in part, on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of equipment, raw and batch materials, natural resources or utilities, equipment, parts and components from our suppliers. We may experience shortages that could adversely affect our operations. A reduction, interruption or delay of supply, or a significant increase in the price for supplies, such as manufacturing equipment, precious metals, raw materials, utilities including energy and industrial water, could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Corning may also experience significant interruptions of its manufacturing operations, delays in its ability to deliver products or services, increased costs or customer order cancellations as a result of:  •  The failure or inability to accurately forecast demand and obtain sufficient quantities of materials, equipment and services on a cost-effective basis; •Volatility in the availability and cost of materials, equipment and services, including rising prices due to inflation or scarcity of availability;•Difficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export approvals;•Shipment delays due to transportation interruptions or capacity constraints;•A worldwide shortage of semiconductor components or other issues;•Information technology or infrastructure failures, including those of a third-party supplier or service provider; and•Natural disasters, the impacts of climate change, or other events beyond Corning’s control (such as earthquakes, utility interruptions, tsunamis, hurricanes, typhoons, floods, storms or extreme weather conditions, fires, regional economic downturns, regional or global health epidemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical turmoil, increased trade restrictions between the U.S. and China and other countries, social unrest, political instability, terrorism, or acts of war) in locations where it or its customers or suppliers have manufacturing, research, engineering or other operations. Corning’s Display Technologies segment generates a significant amount of the Company’s profits and cash flow; any significant decrease in display glass pricing or market share could have a material and negative impact on our financial results Corning’s ability to generate profits and operating cash flow depends largely on the profitability of our display glass business, which is subject to continuous pricing pressure due to factors such as industry competition, potential over-capacity, and development of new technologies. If we are not able to achieve proportionate reductions in costs and/or increases in volume to offset ongoing pricing pressure, it could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. Because we have a concentrated customer base, future sales and cash flows could be negatively impacted by the actions or loss of one or more key customers A relatively small number of end customers account for a high percentage of our net sales.  This concentration subjects us to a variety of risks including:  •  The loss or insolvency of one or more of our key customers, could result in a substantial loss of sales and reduction in anticipated cash flows;  •  Customers may possess substantial leverage in negotiating contractual obligations, including liability provisions; and  •Mergers and consolidations between customers could result in further concentration of the customer base. The following table details the number of combined customers of our reportable segments that accounted for a large percentage of segment net sales:   Number of combined end customers % of total segment net sales in 2022 Optical Communications   2   26%  Display Technologies   2   37%  Specialty Materials   2   49%  Environmental Technologies   3   74%  Life Sciences   2   37%         14     Table of Contents Events outside of Corning’s control, or those of our contract manufacturers, could cause a disruption to our manufacturing operations and our ability to serve our customers, resulting in a negative impact to Corning’s net sales, net income, asset values and liquidity Disruption to our manufacturing operations, or those of our contract manufacturers, could significantly impact Corning’s ability to supply its customers and could produce a near-term severe impact on our individual business units and the Company.

If we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use, or other misappropriation, we may not remain competitive. The intellectual property rights of others could inhibit our ability to introduce new products. Other companies hold patents on technologies used in our industries and are aggressively seeking to expand, enforce and license their patent portfolios. We periodically receive notices from, or have lawsuits filed against us by third parties claiming infringement, misappropriation or other misuse of their intellectual property rights and/or breach of our agreements with them. These third parties often include entities that do not have the capabilities to design, manufacture, or distribute products or entities that acquire intellectual property, including patents, for the sole purpose of monetizing their acquired intellectual property through asserting claims of infringement and misuse. Such claims of infringement or misappropriation may result in loss of revenue, substantial costs, or lead to monetary damages or injunctive relief against us.         15     Table of Contents Information technology dependency and cybersecurity vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, liability claims, competitive or reputational harm, and result in material adverse effects on our operations and financial results The Company is dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure (“IT systems”) owned and operated by the Company or managed by third-party service providers, suppliers and contract manufacturers. IT systems enable us to conduct, monitor and/or protect our business, operations, systems, data and other assets. In the ordinary course of our business, we and our providers collect, process, transmit and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information.  Intrusion into a supplier or contract manufacturer system not integrated with a Corning IT system could result in service disruption and/or loss of financial control.   Our IT systems, and those of our providers, may be vulnerable to compromise or disruption due to human error or malfeasance, outdated applications, computer viruses or malware (e.g., ransomware), natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyber-attacks and other similar incidents and disruptions. Increased work-from-home, at both the Company and our providers, presents additional operational risk.  Companies that provide utilities, water, transportation, natural gas and other resources and services across our supply chain, are critical to our manufacturing operations and are vulnerable to cyber-attacks. From time to time, both we and certain of our providers, have been subject to cyberattacks and security incidents.  We may be unable to anticipate, detect, prevent or remediate future attacks, particularly as attackers are becoming more sophisticated in their ability to circumvent controls and remove forensic evidence. Any significant disruption, breakdown, intrusion, interruption or corruption, data breach, or compromise to the accessibility, security or integrity of our or our providers’ IT systems, or the misappropriation or disclosure of any confidential, proprietary or personally identifiable information, could result in the loss of data or intellectual property, equipment or systems damage, downtime, safety related issues and could have a material adverse effect on our business, including by harming our competitive position and reputation, disrupting our manufacturing, reducing the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives, impairing our ability to access suppliers, contract manufacturers, customers and cloud-based services, subjecting us to litigation or regulatory investigations or fines, increasing the costs of compliance and remediation, or otherwise adversely affecting our business.  We may be required to invest significant additional resources to comply with evolving cybersecurity regulations and to modify and enhance our IT systems, information security and controls, and to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities. Any losses, costs or liabilities may not be covered by, or may exceed the coverage limits of, any, or all, of our applicable insurance policies.  We may not earn a positive return from our research, development and engineering investments  Developing our products through our innovation model of research and development is costly and often involves a long investment cycle. We make significant investments in research, development and engineering that may not earn an economic return. If our investments do not provide a pipeline of products or technologies that our customers demand or lower our manufacturing costs, or if our products or technologies become obsolete, it could negatively impact our revenue and operating margins for both near- and long-term. Our innovation model depends on our ability to attract and retain specialized expertise Our innovation model requires us to employ highly specialized experts in glass science, ceramic science and optical physics to conduct our research and development and engineer our products and design our manufacturing facilities. The loss of the services of any member of our key research and development or engineering team without adequate replacement, or the inability to attract new qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance. We are subject to strict environmental regulations and regulatory changes that could result in fines or restrictions that interrupt our operations Some of our manufacturing processes generate chemical waste, wastewater, other industrial waste or greenhouse gases, and we are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of such substances. We have installed anti-pollution equipment for the treatment of chemical waste and wastewater at our facilities. We have taken steps to control and reduce the amount of greenhouse gases created by our manufacturing operations. However, we cannot provide assurance that environmental claims will not be brought against us or that government regulators will not take steps to adopt more stringent environmental standards.        16     Table of Contents Any failure on our part to comply with any present or future environmental regulations could result in the assessment of damages or imposition of fines against us, or the suspension/cessation of production or operations. In addition, environmental regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment, incur other significant compliance expenses or limit or restrict production or operations and thus materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. Changes in regulations and the regulatory environment in the U.S. and the many other countries in which we operate, such as those resulting from the regulation and impact of climate change, CO2 abatement and emission reduction targets, may affect our businesses and results in adverse ways by, among other things, substantially increasing manufacturing costs, limiting availability of scarce resources, especially energy, or requiring limitations on production or sales of our products or those of our customers. General Risk Factors
 We may have additional tax liabilities We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions and are commonly audited by various tax authorities.  There are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax treatment is uncertain.  Judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes.  Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax, assessments, audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals, or result in the forfeiture of funds deposited with the relevant government authorities.  The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which such a determination is made.   The U.S., other countries and international organizations, such as Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, may change their laws or issue new international tax standards that may also impact our taxes.  As a global company, we face many risks which could adversely impact our operations and financial results  We are a global company and derive a substantial portion of our revenue from, and have significant operations, outside of the U.S. Our international operations include manufacturing, assembly, sales, research and development, customer support and shared administrative service centers. Additionally, we rely on a global supply chain for key components and capabilities that are central to our ability to invent, make and sell products. Compliance with laws and regulations increases our costs. We are subject to both U.S. laws and the local laws where we operate which, among other things, include data privacy requirements, employment and labor laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, prohibitions on payments to governmental officials, import and trade restrictions and export requirements. Non-compliance or violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business. Such violations could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our businesses and operating results. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and manage these risks. Corning is exposed to risks associated with an uncertain, recessionary and inflationary global economy Uncertain or adverse economic and business conditions, including uncertainties and volatility in the financial markets, national debt, fiscal or monetary concerns, availability of government incentives, inflation and rising interest rates in various regions, could materially adversely impact Corning’s operating results. Markets for our products depend largely on business and consumer spending and demand for network capacity, electronics and automotive products. Uncertain or adverse economic and recessionary business conditions, among other factors, that could result in decreases in consumer spending and demand, or cause us to pass on increased costs to our customers, may cause certain of our customers to push out, cancel or refrain from purchasing our products, which could materially adversely impact demand for our products and our operating results. Similarly, changes that result in sudden increases in consumer demand for electronic products have resulted in, and may continue to result in, a shortage of parts and materials needed to manufacture our products or the products in which our products are used. Such shortages, as well as shipment delays due to transportation interruptions, have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our ability to meet our demand requirements.        17     Table of Contents Uncertain economic and industry conditions also make it more challenging for Corning to forecast its operating results, make business decisions and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect its businesses, sources and uses of cash, financial condition and results of operations. If Corning does not appropriately manage its business operations in response to changing economic and industry conditions, it could have a significant negative impact on its business performance and financial condition. Even during periods of economic uncertainty or lower revenues, Corning must continue to invest in research and development and maintain a global business infrastructure to compete effectively and support its customers, which can have a negative impact on its operating margins and earnings. We are also subject to a variety of other risks in managing a global organization, including those related to:  •  The economic and political conditions in each country or region and relationships among countries;  •  Complex regulatory requirements affecting international trade and investment, including anti-dumping laws, export controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local laws prohibiting improper payments. Our operations may be adversely affected by changes in the substance or enforcement of these regulatory requirements, and by actual or alleged violations of them;  •  Fluctuations in currency exchange rates, convertibility of currencies and restrictions involving the movement of funds between jurisdictions and countries;  •  Governmental protectionist policies and sovereign and political risks that may adversely affect Corning’s profitability and assets;  •  Tariffs, trade duties and other trade barriers including anti-dumping and countervailing duties;  •  Geographical concentration of our factories and operations, and regional shifts in our customer base;  •  Periodic health epidemic or pandemic concerns, such as COVID-19;  •  Political unrest, geopolitical tensions, confiscation or expropriation of assets by foreign governments, terrorism and the potential for other hostilities;  •  Difficulty in protecting intellectual property, sensitive commercial and operations data and information technology systems;  •  Differing legal systems, including protection and treatment of intellectual property and patents;  •  Complex, changing or competing tax regimes;  •  Difficulty in collecting obligations owed to us;  •  Natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, tsunamis and windstorms; and  •  Potential loss of utilities or other disruptions affecting manufacturing.  We have significant exposure to foreign currency movements  A large portion of our sales, profit and cash flows are transacted in non-U.S. dollar currencies. The Company expects to continue to experience fluctuations in the U.S. dollar value of these activities if it is not possible, cost-effective or should we not elect to hedge certain currency exposure.  Additionally, gains or losses may be experienced if the underlying exposure which has been hedged increases or decreases significantly. The ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency exposure that we have, the changes in exchange rates associated with those exposures, whether we have entered into foreign currency contracts to offset these exposures and other factors.  These factors, which are variable and generally outside of our control, could materially impact our results of operations, anticipated future results, financial position and cash flows. We may have significant exposure to counterparties of our related derivatives portfolio  We maintain a significant portfolio of over-the-counter derivatives to hedge our projected currency exposure.  We are exposed to potential losses in the event of non-performance by our counterparties to these derivative contracts. Any failure of a counterparty to pay on such a contract when due could materially impact our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Current or future litigation or regulatory investigations may harm our financial condition or results of operations As a global technology and manufacturing company, we are engaged in various litigations and regulatory matters. Litigation and regulatory proceedings may be uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, resulting in significant liabilities, penalties or damages. Any such substantial legal liability or regulatory action could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and reputation.        18     Table of Contents Our business is subject to various governmental regulations, and compliance with these regulations may cause us to incur significant expense. If we fail to maintain compliance with applicable regulations, we may be forced to cease the manufacture and distribution of certain products, and we could be subject to administrative proceedings and civil or criminal penalties Our products and operations are also subject to regulation by U.S. and non‐U.S. regulatory agencies, such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. From time to time, we may also be involved or required to participate in regulatory investigations or inquiries, into certain of our contracting and business practices, which may evolve into legal or other administrative proceedings. Growing public concern over concentration of economic power in corporations is likely to result in increased anti‐competition legislation, regulation, administrative rule making and enforcement activity. Involvement in regulatory investigations or inquiries, can be costly, lengthy, complex and time consuming, diverting the attention and energies of our management and technical personnel.  If any pending or future governmental investigations result in an unfavorable resolution, we could be required to cease the manufacture and sale of the subject products or technology, pay fines or disgorge profits or other payments and/or cease certain conduct and/or modify our contracting or business practices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may be obligated to indemnify our current or former directors or employees, or former directors or employees of companies that we have acquired, in connection with regulatory investigations. These liabilities could be substantial and may include, among other things, the cost of government, law enforcement or regulatory investigations and civil or criminal fines and penalties. Our global operations are subject to extensive trade and anti-corruption laws and regulations Due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of import- and export-related laws and regulations, including U.S. regulations issued by Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and Security, the Office of Anti-boycott Compliance, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and the Office of Foreign Assets Control, as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries. Any alleged or actual violation by an employee or the Company may subject us to government scrutiny, investigation and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the U.S. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject to, based on the way existing laws might be administered or interpreted. In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials to obtain or retain business or obtain an unfair advantage. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Our continued operation and expansion outside the U.S., including in developing countries, could increase the risk of alleged violations. Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition. Moreover, several of our key customers are domiciled in areas of the world with laws, rules and business practices that may notably differ from those in the U.S., and we face the reputational and legal risk that our related partners may violate applicable laws, rules and business practices. International trade policies may negatively impact our ability to sell and manufacture our products outside of the U.S. Government policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas, tariffs and capital controls, whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs, can affect the demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us, our equity affiliates or joint ventures, from being able to sell and manufacture products in certain countries. The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as higher tariffs or new barriers to entry, together with anti-dumping claims, duties, slowed regulatory approvals and other restrictions, in countries in which we import raw materials and components or sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, a country’s adoption of nationalistic policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations.  Further, these actions in conjunction with any trade tensions may restrict us from participating in a specific market or may prevent us from competing effectively.        19     Table of Contents     "
9,GLW,CORNING INC,2022-02-14,"Risk Factors
  We operate in rapidly changing economic, political, and technological environments that present numerous risks. Our operations and financial results are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, our ability to successfully execute our strategy and the trading price of our common stock or debt. The following discussion identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect the Company. This information should be read in conjunction with Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations (""MD&A"") and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this report. The following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider, as these factors could cause our future results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements and from historical trends. Risks Related to Our BusinessThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has, and may continue to, adversely impact the global economy and disrupt our operations and supply chains, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations COVID-19 has impacted and may further impact the global economy and could have additional impacts on economic growth, the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates. The pandemic has resulted in authorities around the world implementing numerous unprecedented measures such as travel restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, vaccine mandates and facility shutdowns. These measures have impacted, and may continue to impact our workforce, operations and supply chains, and those of our customers, contract manufacturers and suppliers, particularly in the event of a significant global resurgence of the illness. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the duration, scope and severity of the pandemic and the impacts on our business and the global economy from the effects of the ongoing pandemic and response measures.   Inflationary price pressures and uncertain availability of commodities, raw materials, utilities, labor or other inputs used by us and our suppliers, or instability in logistics and related costs, could negatively impact our profitability.  Increases in the price of commodities, raw materials, utilities, labor or other inputs that we or our suppliers use in manufacturing and supplying products, components and parts, along with logistics and other related costs, may lead to higher production and shipping costs for our products, parts, and components. Further, increasing global demand for, and uncertain supply of, such materials could disrupt our or our suppliers’ ability to obtain such materials in a timely manner to meet our supply needs and/or could lead to increased costs. Any increase in the cost of inputs to our production could lead to higher costs for our products and could negatively impact our operating results, future profitability and ability to successfully deliver on our strategy. Increasing prices to our customers to offset the impact of higher costs, may cause certain of our customers to push out, cancel or refrain from purchasing our products, which could materially adversely impact demand for our products, and therefore also negatively impact our operating results, future profitability and ability to successfully deliver on our strategy. Supply chain disruptions, manufacturing interruptions or delays, or the failure to accurately forecast customer demand, could affect our ability to meet customer demand, lead to higher costs, or result in excess or obsolete inventory; if we are unable to obtain the necessary equipment, raw and batch materials, natural resources or utilities required in our products or processes, our business will be negatively impacted Corning’s business relies on its timely supply of materials, equipment, services and related products to meet the changing technical and volume requirements of its customers, which depends in part on the timely delivery of materials, equipment and services, from suppliers and contract manufacturers. Significant and sudden increases in demand for such materials, equipment and services, as well as delays in and unpredictability of shipments due to transportation interruptions, have resulted in, and may continue to result in, a shortage of materials, equipment and services needed to manufacture Corning’s products. Such shortages have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our suppliers’ ability to meet our demand requirements and Corning’s manufacturing operations and its ability to meet customer demand. Some key materials, equipment and services are subject to long lead-times or available only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers. Volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment can increase capital, technical, operational and other risks for Corning and for companies throughout our supply chain, and may cause some suppliers to exit businesses, or scale back or cease operations, which could impact our ability to meet customer demand.         14     Table of Contents Our ability to meet customer demand depends, in part, on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of equipment, raw and batch materials, natural resources or utilities, equipment, parts, components and raw materials from our suppliers. We may experience shortages that could adversely affect our operations. Certain manufacturing equipment, components and raw materials are available only from single or limited sources, and we may not be able to find alternate sources in a timely manner. A reduction, interruption or delay of supply, or a significant increase in the price for supplies, such as manufacturing equipment, precious metals, raw materials, utilities including energy and industrial water, could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Corning may also experience significant interruptions of its manufacturing operations, delays in its ability to deliver products or services, increased costs or customer order cancellations as a result of:  •  The failure or inability to accurately forecast demand and obtain sufficient quantities of materials, equipment and services on a cost-effective basis; •Volatility in the availability and cost of materials, equipment and services, including rising prices due to inflation or scarcity of availability;•Difficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export approvals;•Shipment delays due to transportation interruptions or capacity constraints;•A worldwide shortage of semiconductor components as a result of sharp increases in demand for semiconductor products in general;•Information technology or infrastructure failures, including those of a third-party supplier or service provider; and•Natural disasters, the impacts of climate change, or other events beyond Corning’s control (such as earthquakes, utility interruptions, tsunamis, hurricanes, typhoons, floods, storms or extreme weather conditions, fires, regional economic downturns, regional or global health epidemics, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical turmoil, increased trade restrictions between the U.S. and China and other countries, social unrest, political instability, terrorism, or acts of war) in locations where it or its customers or suppliers have manufacturing, research, engineering or other operations. Corning’s Display Technologies segment generates a significant amount of the Company’s profits and cash flow; any significant decrease in display glass pricing or market share could have a material and negative impact on our financial results Corning’s ability to generate profits and operating cash flow depends largely on the profitability of our display glass business, which is subject to continuous pricing pressure due to industry competition, potential over-capacity, and development of new technologies. If we are not able to achieve proportionate reductions in costs and/or increases in volume to offset ongoing pricing pressure, it could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. Because we have a concentrated customer base, future sales and cash flows could be negatively impacted by the actions or loss of one or more key customers A relatively small number of end customers accounted for a high percentage of our net sales.  This concentration subjects us to a variety of risks including:  •  The loss or insolvency of one or more of our key customers, could result in a substantial loss of sales and reduction in anticipated cash flows;  •  Customers may possess substantial leverage in negotiating contractual obligations, including liability provisions; and  •Mergers and consolidations between customers could result in further concentration of the customer base. The following table details the number of combined customers of our segments that accounted for a large percentage of segment net sales:   Number of combined end customers % of total segment net sales in 2021 Display Technologies   3   55%  Optical Communications   2   27%  Specialty Materials   2   43%  Environmental Technologies   3   77%  Life Sciences   2   40%         15     Table of Contents Events outside of Corning’s control, or those of our contract manufacturers, could cause a disruption to our manufacturing operations and adversely impact our customers, resulting in a negative impact to Corning’s net sales, net income, asset values and liquidity Disruption to our manufacturing operations, or those of our contract manufacturers, could significantly impact Corning’s ability to supply its customers and could produce a near-term severe impact on our individual business units and the Company. Given the geographical concentration of certain of the Company's and our contract manufacturers' plants, the highly engineered nature of the facilities and the globally dispersed talent required to run these facilities, any event that adversely affects or restricts movement into or out of a specific geographic area where we, our contract manufacturers, our suppliers, or our customers have a presence, could adversely impact our results. Due to the specialized nature of our products and single-site manufacturing locations, in the event such a location experiences disruption, it we may not be possible to find replacement capacity or substitute production from other facilities.  We may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights, which could result in loss of market share, and we may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others We rely on patent and trade secret laws, copyright, trademark, confidentiality procedures, controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights. Despite our efforts, these protections may be limited and we may encounter difficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights or obtaining rights to additional intellectual property necessary to permit us to continue or expand our businesses. We cannot provide assurance that the patents that we hold or may obtain will provide meaningful protection against our competitors. Changes in or enforcement of laws concerning intellectual property may affect our ability to prevent or address the misappropriation of, or the unauthorized use of, our intellectual property, potentially resulting in loss of market share. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights. Litigation is inherently uncertain and outcomes are unpredictable. If we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use, or other misappropriation, we may not remain competitive. The intellectual property rights of others could inhibit our ability to introduce new products. Other companies hold patents on technologies used in our industries and are aggressively seeking to expand, enforce and license their patent portfolios. We periodically receive notices from, or have lawsuits filed against us by third parties claiming infringement, misappropriation or other misuse of their intellectual property rights and/or breach of our agreements with them. These third parties often include entities that do not have the capabilities to design, manufacture, or distribute products or that acquire intellectual property like patents for the sole purpose of monetizing their acquired intellectual property through asserting claims of infringement and misuse. Such claims of infringement or misappropriation may result in loss of revenue, substantial costs, or lead to monetary damages or injunctive relief against us. Information technology dependency and cybersecurity vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, liability claims, competitive or reputational harm, and result in material adverse effects on our operations and financial results The Company is dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure (“IT systems”) owned and operated by the Company or managed by third-party service providers, suppliers and contract manufacturers. IT systems enable us to conduct, monitor and/or protect our business, operations, systems, data and other assets. In the ordinary course of our business, we and our providers collect, process, transmit and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information.  Intrusion into a supplier or contract manufacturer system not integrated with a Corning IT system could result in service disruption and/or loss of financial control.   Our IT systems, and those of our providers, may be vulnerable to compromise or disruption due to human error or malfeasance, outdated applications, computer viruses or malware (e.g., ransomware), natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyber-attacks and other similar incidents and disruptions. Increased work-from-home, at both the Company and our providers, presents additional operational risk.  Companies that provide utilities, water, transportation, natural gas, and other resources and services across our supply chain, are critical to our manufacturing operations and are vulnerable to cyber-attacks. From time to time, both we and certain of our providers, have been subject to cyberattacks and security incidents.  We may be unable to anticipate, detect, prevent or remediate future attacks, particularly as attackers are becoming more sophisticated in their ability to circumvent controls and remove forensic evidence.         16     Table of Contents Any significant disruption, breakdown, intrusion, interruption or corruption, data breach, or compromise to the accessibility, security or integrity of our or our providers’ IT systems, or the misappropriation or disclosure of any confidential, proprietary or personally identifiable information, could result in the loss of data or intellectual property, equipment or systems damage, downtime, safety related issues and could have a material adverse effect on our business, including by harming our competitive position and reputation, disrupting our manufacturing, reducing the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives, impairing our ability to access suppliers, contract manufacturers, customers, and cloud-based services, subjecting us to litigation or regulatory investigations or fines, increasing the costs of compliance and remediation, or otherwise adversely affecting our business.  We may be required to invest significant additional resources to comply with evolving cybersecurity regulations and to modify and enhance our IT systems, information security and controls, and to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities. Any losses, costs or liabilities may not be covered by, or may exceed the coverage limits of, any, or all, of our applicable insurance policies.  We may not earn a positive return from our research, development and engineering investments  Developing our products through our innovation model of research and development is costly and often involves a long investment cycle. We make significant investments in research, development and engineering that may not earn an economic return. If our investments do not provide a pipeline of products or technologies that our customers demand or lower our manufacturing costs, it could negatively impact our revenue and operating margins for both near- and long-term. Our innovation model depends on our ability to attract and retain specialized experts in our core technologies Our innovation model requires us to employ highly specialized experts in glass science, ceramic science, and optical physics to conduct our research and development and engineer our products and design our manufacturing facilities. The loss of the services of any member of our key research and development or engineering team without adequate replacement, or the inability to attract new qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance. We are subject to strict environmental regulations and regulatory changes that could result in fines or restrictions that interrupt our operations Some of our manufacturing processes generate chemical waste, wastewater, other industrial waste or greenhouse gases, and we are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of such substances. We have installed anti-pollution equipment for the treatment of chemical waste and wastewater at our facilities. We have taken steps to control the amount of greenhouse gases created by our manufacturing operations.

Such violations could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our businesses and operating results. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and manage these risks. Corning is exposed to risks associated with an uncertain and inflationary global economy Uncertain or adverse economic and business conditions, including uncertainties and volatility in the financial markets, national debt, fiscal or monetary concerns, inflation and rising interest rates in various regions, could materially adversely impact Corning’s operating results. Markets for our products depend largely on business and consumer spending and demand for network capacity, electronics and automotive products. Uncertain or adverse economic and business conditions that result in decreases in consumer spending and demand, or cause us to pass on increased costs to our customers, may cause certain of our customers to push out, cancel or refrain from purchasing our products, which could materially adversely impact demand for our products and our operating results. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic, and transportation interruptions and other measures taken in response thereto, have had, and may continue to have, a significant adverse impact on the global and regional economic activity, as well as our ability to meet our customer demand. Similarly, changes that result in sudden increases in consumer demand for electronic products have resulted in, and may continue to result in, a shortage of parts and materials needed to manufacture our products or the products in which our products are used. Such shortages, as well as shipment delays due to transportation interruptions, have adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our ability to meet our demand requirements. Uncertain economic and industry conditions also make it more challenging for Corning to forecast its operating results, make business decisions, and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect its businesses, sources and uses of cash, financial condition and results of operations. If Corning does not appropriately manage its business operations in response to changing economic and industry conditions, it could have a significant negative impact on its business performance and financial condition. Even during periods of economic uncertainty or lower revenues, Corning must continue to invest in research and development and maintain a global business infrastructure to compete effectively and support its customers, which can have a negative impact on its operating margins and earnings.        18     Table of Contents We are also subject to a variety of other risks in managing a global organization, including those related to:  •  The economic and political conditions in each country or region and among countries;  •  Complex regulatory requirements affecting international trade and investment, including anti-dumping laws, export controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local laws prohibiting improper payments. Our operations may be adversely affected by changes in the substance or enforcement of these regulatory requirements, and by actual or alleged violations of them;  •  Fluctuations in currency exchange rates, convertibility of currencies and restrictions involving the movement of funds between jurisdictions and countries;  •  Governmental protectionist policies and sovereign and political risks that may adversely affect Corning’s profitability and assets;  •  Tariffs, trade duties and other trade barriers including anti-dumping duties;  •  Geographical concentration of our factories and operations, and regional shifts in our customer base;  •  Periodic health epidemic or pandemic concerns, such as COVID-19;  •  Political unrest, geopolitical tensions, confiscation or expropriation of assets by foreign governments, terrorism and the potential for other hostilities;  •  Difficulty in protecting intellectual property, sensitive commercial and operations data, and information technology systems;  •  Differing legal systems, including protection and treatment of intellectual property and patents;  •  Complex, changing or competing tax regimes;  •  Difficulty in collecting obligations owed to us;  •  Natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, tsunamis and windstorms; and  •  Potential loss of utilities or other disruption affecting manufacturing.  We have significant exposure to foreign currency movements  A large portion of our sales, profit and cash flows are transacted in non-U.S. dollar currencies. The Company expects to continue to experience fluctuations in the U.S. dollar value of these activities if it is not possible, cost-effective or should we not elect to hedge certain currency exposure.  Additionally, gains or losses may be experienced if the underlying exposure which has been hedged increases or decreases significantly. The ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency exposure that we have, the changes in exchange rates associated with those exposures, whether we have entered into foreign currency contracts to offset these exposures and other factors.  These factors, which are variable and generally outside of our control, could materially impact our results of operations, anticipated future results, financial position and cash flows. We may have significant exposure to counterparties of our related derivatives portfolio  We maintain a significant portfolio of over the counter derivatives to hedge our projected currency exposure.  We are exposed to potential losses in the event of non-performance by our counterparties to these derivative contracts. Any failure of a counterparty to pay on such a contract when due could materially impact our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Current or future litigation or regulatory investigations may harm our financial condition or results of operations As a global technology and manufacturing company, we are engaged in various litigation and regulatory matters. Litigation and regulatory proceedings may be uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, resulting in significant liabilities, penalties or damages. Any such substantial legal liability or regulatory action could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and reputation.        19     Table of Contents Our business is subject to various governmental regulations, and compliance with these regulations may cause us to incur significant expense. If we fail to maintain compliance with applicable regulations, we may be forced to cease the manufacture and distribution of certain products, and we could be subject to administrative proceedings and civil or criminal penalties Our products and operations are also subject to regulation by U.S. and non‐U.S. regulatory agencies, such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”). From time to time, we may also be involved or required to participate in regulatory investigations or inquiries, into certain of our contracting and business practices, which may evolve into legal or other administrative proceedings. Growing public concern over concentration of economic power in corporations is likely to result in increased anti‐competition legislation, regulation, administrative rule making, and enforcement activity. Involvement in regulatory investigations or inquiries, can be costly, lengthy, complex and time consuming, diverting the attention and energies of our management and technical personnel.  If any pending or future governmental investigations result in an unfavorable resolution, we could be required to cease the manufacture and sale of the subject products or technology, pay fines or disgorge profits or other payments, and/or cease certain conduct and/or modify our contracting or business practices, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may be obligated to indemnify our current or former directors or employees, or former directors or employees of companies that we have acquired, in connection with regulatory investigations. These liabilities could be substantial and may include, among other things, the cost of government, law enforcement or regulatory investigations and civil or criminal fines and penalties. Our global operations are subject to extensive trade and anti-corruption laws and regulations Due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of import- and export-related laws and regulations, including U.S. regulations issued by Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and Security, the Office of Anti-boycott Compliance, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and the Office of Foreign Assets Control, as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries. Any alleged or actual violation by an employee or the Company may subject us to government scrutiny, investigation and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the U.S. We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject to, based on the way existing laws might be administered or interpreted. In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials to obtain or retain business, or obtaining an unfair advantage. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws. Our continued operation and expansion outside the U.S., including in developing countries, could increase the risk of alleged violations. Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition. Moreover, several of our key customers are domiciled in areas of the world with laws, rules and business practices that may notably differ from those in the U.S., and we face the reputational and legal risk that our related partners may violate applicable laws, rules and business practices. International trade policies may negatively impact our ability to sell and manufacture our products outside of the U.S. Government policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas, tariffs, and capital controls, whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs, can affect the demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us, our equity affiliates or joint ventures, from being able to sell and manufacture products in certain countries. The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as higher tariffs or new barriers to entry, together with anti-dumping claims, duties, slowed regulatory approvals and other restrictions, in countries in which we import raw materials and components or sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, a government’s adoption of “buy national” policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations.         20     Table of Contents         "

 We operate in rapidly changing economic, political, and technological environments that present numerous risks.  Our operations and financial results are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, our ability to successfully execute our Strategy & Growth Framework and the trading price of our common stock or debt.  The following discussion identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance.  This information should be read in conjunction with our MD&A and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this report.  The following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider, as these factors could cause our future results to differ from those in our forward-looking statements and from historical trends. Risks Related to Our Business The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has, and may continue to, adversely impact the global economy and disrupt our operations and supply chains, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. COVID-19 has impacted and may further impact the global economy and could have additional impacts on economic growth, the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates, and interest rates.  The pandemic has resulted in authorities around the world implementing numerous unprecedented measures such as travel restrictions, quarantines, shelter in place orders, and facility shutdowns. These measures have impacted, and may continue to impact our workforce and operations, and those of our customers, contract manufacturers and suppliers, particularly in the event of a significant global resurgence of the illness. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the duration, scope and severity of the pandemic and the impacts on our business and the global economy from the effects of the ongoing pandemic and response measures.     14Index Corning’s Display Technologies segment generates a significant amount of the Company’s profits and cash flow.  Any significant decrease in display glass pricing or market share could have a material and negative impact on our financial results Corning’s ability to generate profits and operating cash flow depends largely on the profitability of our display glass business, which is subject to continuous pricing pressure due to industry competition, potential over-capacity, and development of new technologies.  If we are not able to achieve proportionate reductions in costs and increases in volume to offset ongoing pricing pressure it could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. Because we have a concentrated customer base in each of our businesses, our sales could be negatively impacted by the actions or insolvency of one or more key customers, as well as our ability to retain these customers A relatively small number of end customers accounted for a high percentage of net sales in each of our reportable segments.  This concentration subjects us to a variety of risks including:  Lower sales and cash flow that could result from the loss of one or more of our key customers;Mergers and consolidations between customers could result in further concentration of Corning’s customer base;The loss or insolvency of a key customer, could result in a substantial loss of sales and reduction in anticipated cash flows; andCustomers may possess substantial leverage in negotiating contractual obligations, including liability provisions. The following table details the number of combined customers of our segments that accounted for a large percentage of segment net sales:             Number of‎combined‎end customers % of total‎segment net‎sales in 2020Display Technologies 4 74%Optical Communications 1 11%Specialty Materials 3 65%Environmental Technologies 3 74%Life Sciences 2 39% Events outside of Corning’s control, could cause a disruption to our manufacturing operations and adversely impact our customers, resulting in a negative impact to Corning’s net sales, net income, asset values and liquidity Disruption to our manufacturing operations could significantly impact Corning’s ability to supply its customers and could produce a near-term severe impact on our individual businesses and the Company as a whole. Given the geographical concentration of certain of our plants, the highly engineered nature of our facilities and the globally dispersed talent required to run these facilities, any event that adversely affects or restricts movement into or out of a specific geographic area where we, our suppliers, or our customers have a presence, could adversely impact our results. Due to the specialized nature of the assets and certain single-site manufacturing locations, in the event such a location experiences disruption, it may not be possible to find replacement capacity or substitute production from other facilities.   15Index   We may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights, which could result in loss of market share, and we may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others We rely on patent and trade secret laws, copyright, trademark, confidentiality procedures, controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights.  Despite our efforts, these protections may be limited and we may encounter difficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights or obtaining rights to additional intellectual property necessary to permit us to continue or expand our businesses.  We cannot provide assurance that the patents that we hold or may obtain will provide meaningful protection against our competitors.  Changes in or enforcement of laws concerning intellectual property may affect our ability to prevent or address the misappropriation of, or the unauthorized use of, our intellectual property, potentially resulting in loss of market share.  Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights.  Litigation is inherently uncertain and outcomes are unpredictable.  If we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use, or other misappropriation, we may not remain competitive. The intellectual property rights of others could inhibit our ability to introduce new products.  Other companies hold patents on technologies used in our industries and are aggressively seeking to expand, enforce and license their patent portfolios.  We periodically receive notices from, or have lawsuits filed against us by third parties claiming infringement, misappropriation or other misuse of their intellectual property rights and/or breach of our agreements with them.  These third parties often include entities that do not have the capabilities to design, manufacture, or distribute products or that acquire intellectual property like patents for the sole purpose of monetizing their acquired intellectual property through asserting claims of infringement and misuse.  Such claims of infringement or misappropriation may result in loss of revenue, substantial costs, or lead to monetary damages or injunctive relief against us.  Information technology dependency and cyber security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, liability claims, or competitive harm The Company is dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure, including cloud-based services (“IT systems”) to conduct its business.  Our IT systems may be vulnerable to disruptions from human error, outdated applications, computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyber-attack and other similar disruptions.  We have measures and defenses in place against such events, but we may not be able to prevent, immediately detect, or remediate all instances of such events.  Any significant disruption, breakdown, intrusion, interruption or corruption of these systems or data breaches could cause the loss of data or intellectual property, equipment damage, downtime, and/or safety related issues and could have a material adverse effect on our business.  A material security breach or disruption of our IT systems could result in theft, unauthorized use, or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information, harm our competitive position, disrupt our manufacturing, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives, impair our ability to access vendors, suppliers and cloud-based services, or otherwise adversely affect our business.  Additionally, we believe that utilities and other operators of critical infrastructure that serve our facilities face heightened security risks, including cyber-attack.  In the event of such an attack, disruption in service from our utility providers could disrupt our manufacturing operations which rely on a continuous source of power (electrical, gas, etc.). We may not earn a positive return from our research, development and engineering investments   Developing our products through our innovation model of research and development is expensive and often involves a long investment cycle.  We make significant expenditures and investments in research, development and engineering that may not earn an economic return.  If our investments do not provide a pipeline of products or technologies that our customers demand or lower our manufacturing costs, it could negatively impact our revenue and operating margins both near- and long-term.  16Index  If we are unable to obtain certain specialized equipment, raw and batch materials or natural resources required in our products or processes, our business will suffer Our ability to meet customer demand depends, in part, on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of equipment, parts, components and raw materials from our suppliers.  We may experience shortages that could adversely affect our operations.  Certain manufacturing equipment, components and raw materials are available only from single or limited sources, and we may not be able to find alternate sources in a timely manner.  A reduction, interruption or delay of supply, or a significant increase in the price for supplies, such as manufacturing equipment, precious metals, raw materials, utilities including energy and industrial water, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses. We use specialized raw materials from single-source suppliers (e.g., specific mines or quarries) and natural resources (e.g., helium) in certain products and processes.  If a supplier is unable to provide the required raw materials or the natural resource is in scarce supply or not readily available, we may be unable to change our product composition or manufacturing process to prevent disruption to our business. Our innovation model depends on our ability to attract and retain specialized experts in our core technologies Our innovation model requires us to employ highly specialized experts in glass science, ceramic science, and optical physics to conduct our research and development and engineer our products and design our manufacturing facilities.  The loss of the services of any member of our key research and development or engineering team without adequate replacement, or the inability to attract new qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance. We are subject to strict environmental regulations and regulatory changes that could result in fines or restrictions that interrupt our operations Some of our manufacturing processes generate chemical waste, waste water, other industrial waste or greenhouse gases, and we are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of such substances.  We have installed anti-pollution equipment for the treatment of chemical waste and waste water at our facilities.  We have taken steps to control the amount of greenhouse gases created by our manufacturing operations.  However, we cannot provide assurance that environmental claims will not be brought against us or that government regulators will not take steps to adopt more stringent environmental standards. Any failure on our part to comply with any present or future environmental regulations could result in the assessment of damages or imposition of fines against us, or the suspension/cessation of production or operations.  In addition, environmental regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment, incur other significant compliance expenses or limit or restrict production or operations and thus materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. Changes in regulations and the regulatory environment in the U.S. and other countries, such as those resulting from the regulation and impact of global warming and CO2 abatement, may affect our businesses and their results in adverse ways by, among other things, substantially increasing manufacturing costs, limiting availability of scarce resources, especially energy, or requiring limitations on production and sale of our products or those of our customers. General Risk Factors
 We may have additional tax liabilities We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions, and are commonly audited by various tax authorities.  There are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax treatment is uncertain.  Judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes.  Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.  The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made.17Index    The 2017 Tax Act significantly impacted how U.S. global corporations are taxed.  Significant guidance has been issued with the intention of clarifying the new tax provisions.  To date, some of the regulations had been finalized and clarified but a considerable amount of this guidance is still in the form of proposed regulations.  Due to the volume and complexity of both the final and proposed regulations, we continue to evaluate any development and impact of the 2017 Tax Act that could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow.  In addition to the 2017 Tax Act, other foreign countries and international organizations, such as Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”), may have law changes and issue new international tax standards that may also impact our taxes. As a global company, we face many risks which could adversely impact our operations and financial results  We are a global company and derive a substantial portion of our revenue from, and have significant operations, outside of the United States.  Our international operations include manufacturing, assembly, sales, research and development, customer support, and shared administrative service centers.  Additionally, we rely on a global supply chain for key components and capabilities that are central to our ability to invent, make and sell products. Compliance with laws and regulations increases our costs.  We are subject to both U.S. laws and the local laws where we operate which, among other things, include data privacy requirements, employment and labor laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, prohibitions on payments to governmental officials, import and trade restrictions and export requirements.  Non-compliance or violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business.  Such violations could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and operating results.  Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and manage these risks.  We are also subject to a variety of other risks in managing a global organization, including those related to: The economic and political conditions in each country or region and among countries;Complex regulatory requirements affecting international trade and investment, including anti-dumping laws, export controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local laws prohibiting improper payments.  Our operations may be adversely affected by changes in the substance or enforcement of these regulatory requirements, and by actual or alleged violations of them;Fluctuations in currency exchange rates, convertibility of currencies and restrictions involving the movement of funds between jurisdictions and countries; Governmental protectionist policies and sovereign and political risks that may adversely affect Corning’s profitability and assets;Tariffs, trade duties and other trade barriers including anti-dumping duties;Geographical concentration of our factories and operations, and regional shifts in our customer base;Periodic health epidemic concerns;Political unrest, confiscation or expropriation of assets by foreign governments, terrorism and the potential for other hostilities; Difficulty in protecting intellectual property, sensitive commercial and operations data, and information technology systems;Differing legal systems, including protection and treatment of intellectual property and patents;Complex, changing or competing tax regimes; Difficulty in collecting obligations owed to us;Natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, tsunamis and windstorms; andPotential loss of utilities or other disruption affecting manufacturing.18Index   We have significant exposure to foreign currency movements   A large portion of our sales, profit and cash flows are transacted in non-U.S. dollar currencies.  The Company expects to continue to experience fluctuations in the U.S. dollar value of these activities if it is not possible, cost-effective or should we not elect to hedge certain currency exposure.  Additionally, gains or losses may be experienced if the underlying exposure which has been hedged increases or decreases significantly. The ultimate realized loss or gain with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency exposure that we have, the changes in exchange rates associated with those exposures, whether we have entered into foreign currency contracts to offset these exposures and other factors.   Foreign currency movements may impact our competitive cost position relative to our largest, Japan-based competitors in the Display Technologies segment.  The profitability of customers may also be impacted as they typically purchase from us in Japanese yen and sell in various currencies. These factors, which are variable and generally outside of our control, could materially impact our results of operations, anticipated future results, financial position and cash flows. We may have significant exposure to counterparties of our related derivatives portfolio  We maintain a significant portfolio of over the counter derivatives to hedge our projected currency and periodically may utilize interest rate derivatives, equity derivatives, and commodities.  We are exposed to potential losses in the event of non-performance by our counterparties to these derivative contracts.  Any failure of a counterparty to pay on such a contract when due could materially impact our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. Current or future litigation or regulatory investigations may harm our financial condition or results of operations As a global technology and manufacturing company, we are engaged in various litigation and regulatory matters.  Litigation and regulatory proceedings may be uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, resulting in significant liabilities, penalties or damages.  Any such substantial legal liability or regulatory action could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and reputation.  Our global operations are subject to extensive trade and anti-corruption laws and regulations Due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of import- and export-related laws and regulations, including U.S. regulations issued by Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and Security, the Office of Anti-boycott Compliance, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and the Office of Foreign Assets Control, as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries.  Any alleged or actual violation by an employee or the Company may subject us to government scrutiny, investigation and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the United States.  We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the way existing laws might be administered or interpreted. In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials to obtain or retain business, or obtaining an unfair advantage.  Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws.  Our continued operation and expansion outside the United States, including in developing countries, could increase the risk of alleged violations.  Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition. 19Index   Moreover, several of our key customers are domiciled in areas of the world with laws, rules and business practices that may notably differ from those in the United States, and we face the reputational and legal risk that our related partners may violate applicable laws, rules and business practices. International trade policies may negatively impact our ability to sell and manufacture our products outside of the U.S. Government policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas, tariffs, and capital controls, whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs, can affect the demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us, our equity affiliates or joint ventures, from being able to sell and manufacture products in certain countries.  The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as higher tariffs or new barriers to entry, in countries in which we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  For example, a government’s adoption of “buy national” policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations"

Corning’s Display Technologies segment generates a significant amount of the Company’s profits and cash flow.  Any significant decrease in display glass pricing or market share could have a material and negative impact on our financial results Corning’s ability to generate profits and operating cash flow depends largely on the profitability of our display glass business, which is subject to continuous pricing pressure due to industry competition, potential over-capacity, and development of new technologies.  If we are not able to achieve proportionate reductions in costs and increases in volume to offset ongoing pricing pressure it could have a material adverse impact on our financial results. Because we have a concentrated customer base in each of our businesses, our sales could be negatively impacted by the actions or insolvency of one or more key customers, as well as our ability to retain these customers A relatively small number of end customers accounted for a high percentage of net sales in each of our reportable segments.  Mergers and consolidations between customers could result in further concentration of Corning’s customer base.  Further concentration, or the loss or insolvency of a key customer, could result in a substantial loss of sales and reduction in anticipated in cash flows.   The following table details the number of combined customers of our segments that accounted for a large percentage of segment net sales:             Number of‎combined‎end customers % of total‎segment net‎sales in 2019     Display Technologies 4 72%Optical Communications 2 21%Specialty Materials 3 59%Environmental Technologies 3 74%Life Sciences 2 41% © 2020 Corning Incorporated. All Rights Reserved. 13Index  Business disruptions could affect our operating results  A major earthquake, weather event, fire or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical facilities, or our suppliers’ or customers’ facilities, could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our financial results could be materially and adversely affected.  For example, certain manufacturing sites require high quality, continuous, and uninterrupted power and access to industrial water.  Unplanned outages could have a material negative impact on our operations and ability to supply our customers.   We have been closely monitoring the outbreak of the coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China. We have operations in Wuhan and other areas of China. We have taken steps to protect our employees and operations.  The coronavirus may impact the global economy, our ability, as well as the ability of our customers and suppliers, to manufacture products and may reduce demand in our markets which could result in an impact to our financial results. We are taking steps to mitigate potential financial impacts, including supplying customers from other regions when appropriate.  Currently, it is not possible for us to determine the financial impact of the coronavirus, if any.  Additionally, a significant amount of the specialized manufacturing capacity for our reportable segments is concentrated in single-site locations.  Due to the specialized nature of the assets, in the event such a location experiences disruption, it may not be possible to find replacement capacity quickly or substitute production from other facilities.  Accordingly, disruption at a single-site manufacturing operation could significantly impact Corning’s ability to supply its customers and could produce a near-term severe impact on our individual businesses and the Company as a whole. Geopolitical events, as well as other events outside of Corning’s control, could cause a disruption to our manufacturing operations and adversely impact our customers, resulting in a negative impact to Corning’s net sales, net income, asset values and liquidity A natural disaster, epidemic, labor strike, war and social or political unrest in regions where we operate could adversely affect Corning’s ability to supply our customers and impact the value of our assets.  Such events may also impact our customers’ facilities and reduce our sales to such customers.  For example, a sizeable portion of Corning’s glass manufacturing capacity is in South Korea and we generate a significant portion of our sales through two South Korean customers.  Deterioration of the geopolitical climate in such a region could cause a disruption to our manufacturing operations and adversely impact our customers, resulting in a negative impact to Corning’s net sales, net income, asset values and liquidity. Given the geographical concentration of certain of our plants, the highly engineered nature of our facilities and the globally dispersed talent required to run these facilities, any event that adversely affects or restricts movement into or out of a specific geographic area where we, our suppliers, or our customers have a presence, could adversely impact our results. We may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights, which could result in loss of market share, and we may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others We rely on patent and trade secret laws, copyright, trademark, confidentiality procedures, controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights.  Despite our efforts, these protections may be limited and we may encounter difficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights or obtaining rights to additional intellectual property necessary to permit us to continue or expand our businesses.  We cannot provide assurance that the patents that we hold or may obtain will provide meaningful protection against our competitors.  Changes in or enforcement of laws concerning intellectual property may affect our ability to prevent or address the misappropriation of, or the unauthorized use of, our intellectual property, potentially resulting in loss of market share.  Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights.  Litigation is inherently uncertain and outcomes are unpredictable.  If we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use, or other misappropriation, we may not remain competitive. © 2020 Corning Incorporated. All Rights Reserved. 14Index  The intellectual property rights of others could inhibit our ability to introduce new products.  Other companies hold patents on technologies used in our industries and are aggressively seeking to expand, enforce and license their patent portfolios.  We periodically receive notices from, or have lawsuits filed against us by third parties claiming infringement, misappropriation or other misuse of their intellectual property rights and/or breach of our agreements with them.  These third parties often include entities that do not have the capabilities to design, manufacture, or distribute products or that acquire intellectual property like patents for the sole purpose of monetizing their acquired intellectual property through asserting claims of infringement and misuse.  Such claims of infringement or misappropriation may result in loss of revenue, substantial costs, or lead to monetary damages or injunctive relief against us.  Information technology dependency and cyber security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, liability claims, or competitive harm The Company is dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure, including cloud-based services, (“IT systems”) to conduct its business.  Our IT systems may be vulnerable to disruptions from human error, outdated applications, computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyber-attack and other similar disruptions.  We have measures and defenses in place against such events, but we may not be able to prevent, immediately detect, or remediate all instances of such events.  Any significant disruption, breakdown, intrusion, interruption or corruption of these systems or data breaches could cause the loss of data or intellectual property, equipment damage, downtime, and/or safety related issues and could have a material adverse effect on our business.  A material security breach or disruption of our IT systems could result in theft, unauthorized use, or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information, harm our competitive position, disrupt our manufacturing, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives, impair our ability to access vendors, suppliers and cloud-based services, or otherwise adversely affect our business.  Additionally, we believe that utilities and other operators of critical infrastructure that serve our facilities face heightened security risks, including cyber-attack.  In the event of such an attack, disruption in service from our utility providers could disrupt our manufacturing operations which rely on a continuous source of power (electrical, gas, etc.). We may not earn a positive return from our research, development and engineering investments   Developing our products through our innovation model of research and development is expensive and often involves a long investment cycle.  We make significant expenditures and investments in research, development and engineering that may not earn an economic return.  If our investments do not provide a pipeline of products or technologies that our customers demand or lower our manufacturing costs, it could negatively impact our revenues and operating margins both near- and long-term.  We have significant exposure to foreign currency movements   A large portion of our sales, profit and cash flows are transacted in non-U.S. dollar currencies and we expect that we will continue to experience fluctuations in the U.S. dollar value of these activities if it is not possible or cost effective to hedge our currency exposures or should we elect not to hedge certain currency exposures.  Alternatively, we may experience gains or losses if the underlying exposure which we have hedged increases or decreases significantly and we are unable to reverse, unwind, or terminate the hedges concurrent with changes in the underlying notional exposure.   Our ultimate realized loss or gain with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency exposures that we have, the exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, whether we have entered into foreign currency contracts to offset these exposures and other factors.   Our hedge portfolio may reduce our ability to respond to price moves by our Display Technologies segment competitors.  Foreign currency movements may impact our competitive cost position relative to our largest, Japan-based competitors in the Display Technologies segment.  The profitability of customers may also be impacted as they typically purchase from us in Japanese yen and sell in various currencies. © 2020 Corning Incorporated. All Rights Reserved. 15Index   These factors, which are variable and generally outside of our control, could materially impact our results of operations, anticipated future results, financial position and cash flows. We may have significant exposure to counterparties of our related derivatives portfolio  We maintain a significant portfolio of over the counter derivatives to hedge our projected currency exposure to the Japanese yen, new Taiwan dollar, South Korean won, Chinese yuan and euro.  We are exposed to potential losses in the event of non-performance by our counterparties to these derivative contracts.  Any failure of a counterparty to pay on such a contract when due could materially impact our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. If we are unable to obtain certain specialized equipment, raw and batch materials or natural resources required in our products or processes, our business will suffer Our ability to meet customer demand depends, in part, on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of equipment, parts, components and raw materials from our suppliers.  We may experience shortages that could adversely affect our operations.  Certain manufacturing equipment, components and raw materials are available only from single or limited sources, and we may not be able to find alternate sources in a timely manner.  A reduction, interruption or delay of supply, or a significant increase in the price for supplies, such as manufacturing equipment, precious metals, raw materials, utilities including energy and industrial water, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses. We use specialized raw materials from single-source suppliers (e.g., specific mines or quarries) and natural resources (e.g., helium) in certain products and processes.  If a supplier is unable to provide the required raw materials or the natural resource is in scarce supply or not readily available, we may be unable to change our product composition or manufacturing process to prevent disruption to our business. We may have additional tax liabilities We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions, and are commonly audited by various tax authorities.  There are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax treatment is uncertain.  Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes.  Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.  The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made. The 2017 Tax Act significantly impacted how U.S. global corporations are taxed.  Significant guidance has been issued with the intention of clarifying the new tax provisions.  To date, some of the regulations had been finalized and clarified but a considerable amount of this guidance is still in the form of proposed regulations.  Due to volume and complexity of both of final and proposed regulations, we continue to evaluate any development and impact of the 2017 Tax Act that could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow.  In addition to the 2017 Tax Act, other foreign countries and international organizations such as Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”) may have law changes and issue new international tax standards that may also impact our taxes. Our innovation model depends on our ability to attract and retain specialized experts in our core technologies Our innovation model requires us to employ highly specialized experts in glass science, ceramic science, and optical physics to conduct our research and development and engineer our products and design our manufacturing facilities.  The loss of the services of any member of our key research and development or engineering team without adequate replacement, or the inability to attract new qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance. © 2020 Corning Incorporated. All Rights Reserved. 16Index  We are subject to strict environmental regulations and regulatory changes that could result in fines or restrictions that interrupt our operations Some of our manufacturing processes generate chemical waste, waste water, other industrial waste or greenhouse gases, and we are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of such substances.  We have installed anti-pollution equipment for the treatment of chemical waste and waste water at our facilities.  We have taken steps to control the amount of greenhouse gases created by our manufacturing operations.  However, we cannot provide assurance that environmental claims will not be brought against us or that government regulators will not take steps to adopt more stringent environmental standards. Any failure on our part to comply with any present or future environmental regulations could result in the assessment of damages or imposition of fines against us, or the suspension/cessation of production or operations.  In addition, environmental regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment, incur other significant compliance expenses or limit or restrict production or operations and thus materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. Changes in regulations and the regulatory environment in the U.S. and other countries, such as those resulting from the regulation and impact of global warming and CO2 abatement, may affect our businesses and their results in adverse ways by, among other things, substantially increasing manufacturing costs, limiting availability of scarce resources, especially energy, or requiring limitations on production and sale of our products or those of our customers. Current or future litigation or regulatory investigations may harm our financial condition or results of operations As a global technology and manufacturing company, we are engaged in various litigation and regulatory matters.  Litigation and regulatory proceedings may be uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, resulting in significant liabilities, penalties or damages.  Any such substantial legal liability or regulatory action could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and reputation.  Our global operations are subject to extensive trade and anti-corruption laws and regulations Due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of import- and export-related laws and regulations, including U.S. regulations issued by Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and Security, the Office of Anti-boycott Compliance, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and the Office of Foreign Assets Control, as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries.  Any alleged or actual violation by an employee or the Company may subject us to government scrutiny, investigation and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the United States.  We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the way existing laws might be administered or interpreted. In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, or obtaining an unfair advantage.  Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws.  Our continued operation and expansion outside the United States, including in developing countries, could increase the risk of alleged violations.  Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition. Moreover, several of our key customers are domiciled in areas of the world with laws, rules and business practices that may notably differ from those in the United States, and we face the reputational and legal risk that our related partners may violate applicable laws, rules and business practices. © 2020 Corning Incorporated. All Rights Reserved. 17Index   International trade policies may negatively impact our ability to sell and manufacture our products outside of the U.S. Government policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas, tariffs, and capital controls, whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs, can affect the demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us (including our equity affiliates/joint ventures) from being able to sell and/or manufacture products in certain countries.  The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as higher tariffs or new barriers to entry, in countries in which we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  For example, a government’s adoption of “buy national” policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations.  These policies also affect our equity companies"

For example, a sizeable portion of Corning’s glass manufacturing capacity is located in South Korea and we generate a significant portion of our sales through two South Korean customers.  Deterioration of the geopolitical climate in such a region could cause a disruption to our manufacturing operations and adversely impact our customers, resulting in a negative impact to Corning’s net sales, net income, asset values and liquidity.﻿We may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights, which could result in loss of market share, and we may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others﻿We rely on patent and trade secret laws, copyright, trademark, confidentiality procedures, controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights.  Despite our efforts, these protections may be limited and we may encounter difficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights or obtaining rights to additional intellectual property necessary to permit us to continue or expand our businesses.  We cannot provide assurance that the patents that we hold or may obtain will provide meaningful protection against our competitors.  Changes in or enforcement of laws concerning intellectual property, worldwide, may affect our ability to prevent or address the misappropriation of, or the unauthorized use of, our intellectual property, potentially resulting in loss of market share.  Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights.  Litigation is inherently uncertain and outcomes are often unpredictable.  If we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use, or other misappropriation, we may not remain competitive.﻿The intellectual property rights of others could inhibit our ability to introduce new products.  Other companies hold patents on technologies used in our industries and are aggressively seeking to expand, enforce and license their patent portfolios.  We periodically receive notices from, or have lawsuits filed against us by third parties claiming infringement, misappropriation or other misuse of their intellectual property rights and/or breach of our agreements with them.  These third parties often include entities that do not have the capabilities to design, manufacture, or distribute products or that acquire intellectual property like patents for the sole purpose of monetizing their acquired intellectual property through asserting claims of infringement and misuse.  Such claims of infringement or misappropriation may result in loss of revenue, substantial costs, or lead to monetary damages or injunctive relief against us.   © 2018 Corning Incorporated. All Rights Reserved			 		13 Index 			 		Information technology dependency and cyber security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, liability claims, or competitive harm﻿The Company is dependent on information technology (“IT”) systems and infrastructure for its business and manufacturing controls.   Our IT systems may be vulnerable to disruptions from human error, outdated applications, computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyber-attack and other similar disruptions.    Any significant disruption, breakdown, intrusion, interruption or corruption of these systems or data breaches could cause the loss of data, equipment damage, downtime, and/or safety related issues and could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Like other global companies, we have, from time to time, experienced incidents related to our IT systems, and expect that such incidents will continue, including malware and computer virus attacks, unauthorized access, systems failures and disruptions.  We have measures and defenses in place against unauthorized access, but we may not be able to prevent, immediately detect, or remediate such events.    A material breach in the security of our IT systems could include the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets.  Such disruptions or security breaches could result in the theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information, harm our competitive position, disrupt our manufacturing, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives, or otherwise adversely affect our business. ﻿Additionally, we believe that utilities and other operators of critical infrastructure that serve our facilities face heightened security risks, including cyber-attack.  In the event of such an attack, disruption in service from our utility providers could disrupt our manufacturing operations which rely on a continuous source of power (electrical, gas, etc.).﻿We may not earn a positive return from our research, development and engineering investments  ﻿Developing our products through our innovation model of research and development is expensive and often involves a long investment cycle.  We make significant expenditures and investments in research and development and four process engineering platforms that may earn an economic return.   If our investments do not provide a pipeline of new technologies that our customers demand or lower cost manufacturing platforms, it could negatively impact our revenues and operating margins both near- and long-term. ﻿We have significant exposure to foreign currency movements  ﻿A large portion of our sales, profit and cash flows are transacted in non-U.S. dollar currencies and we expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to these exposures.  We will experience foreign currency gains and losses in certain instances if it is not possible or cost effective to hedge our currency exposures or should we elect not to hedge certain currency exposures.  Alternatively, we may experience gains or losses if the underlying exposure which we have hedged change (increases or decreases) and we are unable to reverse, unwind, or terminate the hedges concurrent with the change in the underlying notional exposure.  ﻿Our ultimate realized loss or gain with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency exposures that we have, the exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, whether we have entered into foreign currency contracts to offset these exposures and other factors.  Our hedge portfolio may reduce our flexibility to respond to price moves by our Display Technologies segment competitors.﻿Foreign currency movements may also impact our competitive cost position relative to our largest, Japan-based competitors in the Display Technologies segment.  The profitability of customers may also be impacted as they typically purchase from us in Japanese yen and they sell in various currencies.﻿All of these factors could materially impact our results of operations, anticipated future results, financial position and cash flows, the timing of which is variable and generally outside of our control.﻿We have significant exposure to counterparties of our related derivatives portfolio ﻿We maintain a significant portfolio of over the counter derivatives to hedge our projected currency exposure to the Japanese yen, New Taiwan dollar, South Korean won, Chinese yuan and euro.  We are exposed to potential losses in the event of non-performance by our counterparties to these derivative contracts.  Any failure of a counterparty to pay on such a contract when due could materially impact our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. © 2018 Corning Incorporated. All Rights Reserved			 		14 Index If we are unable to obtain certain specialized equipment, raw and batch materials or natural resources required in our products or processes, our business will suffer﻿Our ability to meet customer demand depends, in part, on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of equipment, parts and components from our suppliers.  We may experience shortages that could adversely affect our operations.  There can be no assurances that we will not encounter problems in the future.  Certain manufacturing equipment and components are available only from single or limited sources, and we may not be able to find alternate sources in a timely manner.  A reduction, interruption or delay of supply, or a significant increase in the price for supplies, such as manufacturing equipment, precious metals, raw materials, utilities including energy and industrial water, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses.﻿We use specialized raw materials from single-source suppliers (e.g., specific mines or quarries) and natural resources (e.g., helium) in certain products and processes.  If a supplier is unable to provide the required raw materials or the natural resource is in scarce supply or not readily available, we may be unable to change our product composition or manufacturing process in order to prevent a disruption to our business.﻿We have incurred, and may in the future incur, goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges﻿At December 31, 2017, Corning had goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately  $2.6 billion.  While we believe the estimates and judgments about future cash flows used in the goodwill impairment tests are reasonable, we cannot provide assurance that additional impairment charges in the future will not be required if the expected cash flow estimates as projected by management do not occur, especially if an economic recession occurs and continues for a lengthy period or becomes severe, or if acquisitions and investments made by the Company fail to achieve expected returns.﻿Changes in our effective tax rate or tax liability may have an adverse effect on our results of operations﻿Our effective tax rate could be adversely impacted by several factors, including:﻿ ·Changes in the relative amounts of income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates; ·Changes in tax laws, tax treaties and regulations or the interpretation of them, including the recent Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “2017 Tax Act”) passed by the U.S. Congress and signed into law on December 22, 2017; ·Changes to our assessment about the realizability of our deferred tax assets that are based on estimates of our future results, the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies, and the economic and political environments in which we do business; ·The outcome of current and future tax audits, examinations, or administrative appeals; ·Changes in generally accepted accounting principles that affect the accounting for taxes; and ·Limitations or adverse findings regarding our ability to do business in some jurisdictions.﻿We may have additional tax liabilities﻿We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions and are commonly audited by various tax authorities.  In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.  Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes.  Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.  The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made.﻿The recent 2017 Tax Act could significantly impact how U.S. global corporations are taxed.  We are in the process of evaluating the impact of this new legislation and certain changes could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow.  Among other things, the 2017 Tax Act requires companies to pay a one-time mandatory tax on unrepatriated earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred (the “toll charge”) and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings.  The toll charge resulted in an additional $1.1 billion provisional tax expense.  However, settlement of the toll charge will occur almost entirely through the use of existing foreign tax credit carryovers of $1.1 billion.﻿Our innovation model depends on our ability to attract and retain specialized experts in our core technologies﻿Our innovation model requires us to employ highly specialized experts in glass science, ceramic science, and optical physics to conduct our research and development and engineer our products and design our manufacturing facilities.  The loss of the services of any member of our key research and development or engineering team without adequate replacement, or the inability to attract new qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance. © 2018 Corning Incorporated. All Rights Reserved			 		15 Index 			 		We are subject to strict environmental regulations and regulatory changes that could result in fines or restrictions that interrupt our operations﻿Some of our manufacturing processes generate chemical waste, waste water, other industrial waste or greenhouse gases, and we are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of such substances.  We have installed anti-pollution equipment for the treatment of chemical waste and waste water at our facilities.  We have taken steps to control the amount of greenhouse gases created by our manufacturing operations.  However, we cannot provide assurance that environmental claims will not be brought against us or that government regulators will not take steps to adopt more stringent environmental standards.﻿Any failure on our part to comply with any present or future environmental regulations could result in the assessment of damages or imposition of fines against us, or the suspension/cessation of production or operations.  In addition, environmental regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment, incur other significant compliance expenses or limit or restrict production or operations and thus materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.﻿Changes in regulations and the regulatory environment in the U.S. and other countries, such as those resulting from the regulation and impact of global warming and CO2 abatement, may affect our businesses and their results in adverse ways by, among other things, substantially increasing manufacturing costs, limiting availability of scarce resources, especially energy, or requiring limitations on production and sale of our products or those of our customers.﻿Current or future litigation or regulatory investigations may harm our financial condition or results of operations﻿As a global technology and manufacturing company, we are engaged in various litigation and regulatory matters.  Litigation and regulatory proceedings may be uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, resulting in significant liabilities, penalties or damages.  Such current or future substantial legal liabilities or regulatory actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and reputation. ﻿Our global operations are subject to extensive trade and anti-corruption laws and regulations Due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of import- and export-related laws and regulations, including U.S. regulations issued by Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and Security, the Office of Anti-boycott Compliance, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and the Office of Foreign Assets Control, as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries.  Any alleged or actual violation by an employee or the Company may subject us to government scrutiny, investigation and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the United States.  We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.﻿In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, or obtaining an unfair advantage.  Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws.  Our continued operation and expansion outside the United States, including in developing countries, could increase the risk of alleged violations.  Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition.﻿Moreover, several of our related partners are domiciled in areas of the world with laws, rules and business practices that differ from those in the United States, and we face the reputational and legal risk that our related partners may violate applicable laws, rules and business practices. © 2018 Corning Incorporated. All Rights Reserved			 		16 Index International trade policies may negatively impact our ability to sell and manufacture our products outside of the U.S. Government policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas, tariffs, and capital controls, whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs, can affect the demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us (including our equity affiliates/joint ventures) from being able to sell and/or manufacture products in certain countries.  The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as higher tariffs or new barriers to entry, in countries in which we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  For example, a government’s adoption of “buy national” policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations.  These policies also affect our equity companies.    ﻿"

We operate in rapidly changing economic, political, and technological environments that present numerous risks, many of which are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict.  Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, our ability to successfully execute our strategy and capital allocation framework, and the trading price of our common stock or debt.  The following discussion of ""risk factors"" identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance.  This information should be read in conjunction with MD&A and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this report.  The following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider, as these factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical trends.As a global company, we face many risks which could adversely impact our operations and reported financial resultsWe are a global company and derive a substantial portion of our revenues from, and have significant operations, outside of the United States.  Our international operations include manufacturing, assembly, sales, research and development, customer support, and shared administrative service centers.Compliance with laws and regulations increases our costs.  We are subject to both U.S. laws and local laws which, among other things, include data privacy requirements, employment and labor laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, prohibitions on payments to governmental officials, import and trade restrictions and export requirements.  Non-compliance or violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business.  Such violations could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results.  Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and manage these risks.We are also subject to a variety of other risks in managing a global organization, including those related to:·The economic and political conditions in each country or region;·Complex regulatory requirements affecting international trade and investment, including anti-dumping laws, export controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local laws prohibiting improper payments.  Our operations may be adversely affected by changes in the substance or enforcement of these regulatory requirements, and by actual or alleged violations of them;·Fluctuations in currency exchange rates, convertibility of currencies and restrictions involving the movement of funds between jurisdictions and countries;·Sovereign and political risks that may adversely affect Corning's profitability and assets;·Geographical concentration of our factories and operations, and regional shifts in our customer base;·Periodic health epidemic concerns;·Political unrest, confiscation or expropriation of our assets by foreign governments, terrorism and the potential for other hostilities;·Difficulty in protecting intellectual property, sensitive commercial and operations data, and information technology systems;·Differing legal systems, including protection and treatment of intellectual property and patents;11Table of Contents·Complex, or competing tax regimes;·Tariffs, trade duties and other trade barriers including anti-dumping duties;·Difficulty in collecting obligations owed to us;·Natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, tsunamis and windstorms; and·Potential loss of utilities or other disruption affecting manufacturing.Corning's Display Technologies segment generates a significant amount of the Company's profits and cash flow.  Any significant decrease in LCD glass pricing could have a material and negative impact on our financial resultsCorning's ability to generate profits and operating cash flow depends largely upon the profitability of our LCD glass business, which is subject to continuous pricing pressure due to intense industry competition, potential over-capacity, and development of new technologies.  If we are not able to achieve proportionate reductions in costs or sustain our current rate of cost reduction to offset potential pricing pressures it could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.Because we have a concentrated customer base in each of our businesses, our sales could be negatively impacted by the actions or insolvency of one or more key customers, as well as our ability to retain these customersA relatively small number of customers accounted for a high percentage of net sales in our reportable segments.  Mergers and consolidations between customers could result in further concentration of Corning's customer base.  If further concentration occurs or a key customer becomes insolvent, the loss of a key customer could result in a substantial loss of sales and reduction in anticipated in cash flows.  Unforeseen events or actions on the part of Corning could also result in the loss of customers, resulting in further customer concentration.The following table details the number of combined customers of our segments that accounted for a large percentage of segment net sales: Number ofcombined customers % of totalsegment net sales in 2016    Display Technologies3 65%Optical Communications1 15%Environmental Technologies3 85%Specialty Materials3 56%Life Sciences2 46%Business disruptions could affect our operating resultsA significant portion of our manufacturing, research and development activities, and certain other critical business operations are concentrated in a few geographic areas.  A major earthquake, fire or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical facilities could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future financial results could be materially and adversely affected.  For example, certain manufacturing sites require high quality, continuous, and uninterrupted power and access to industrial water.  Unplanned outages could have a material negative impact on our operations and ability to supply our customers.Additionally, a significant amount of the specialized manufacturing capacity for our reportable segments is concentrated in single-site locations and it is reasonably possible that the operations of one or more such facilities could be disrupted.  Due to the specialized nature of the assets, it may not be possible to find replacement capacity quickly or substitute production from other facilities.  Accordingly, a disruption at a single-site manufacturing operation could significantly impact Corning's ability to supply its customers and could produce a near-term severe impact on our individual businesses and the Company as a whole.12Table of ContentsWe may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights, which could result in loss of market share, and we may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of othersWe rely on patent and trade secret laws, copyright, trademark, confidentiality procedures, controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights.  Despite our efforts, these protections may be limited and we may encounter difficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights or obtaining rights to additional intellectual property necessary to permit us to continue or expand our businesses.  We cannot provide assurance that the patents that we hold or may obtain will provide meaningful protection against our competitors.  Changes in or enforcement of laws concerning intellectual property, worldwide, may affect our ability to prevent or address the misappropriation of, or the unauthorized use of, our intellectual property, potentially resulting in loss of market share.  Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights.  Litigation is inherently uncertain and outcomes are often unpredictable.  If we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use, or other misappropriation, we may not remain competitive.The intellectual property rights of others could inhibit our ability to introduce new products.  Other companies hold patents on technologies used in our industries and are aggressively seeking to expand, enforce and license their patent portfolios.  We periodically receive notices from, or have lawsuits filed against us by third parties claiming infringement, misappropriation or other misuse of their intellectual property rights and/or breach of our agreements with them.  These third parties often include entities that do not have the capabilities to design, manufacture, or distribute products or that acquire intellectual property like patents for the sole purpose of monetizing their acquired intellectual property through asserting claims of infringement and misuse.  Such claims of infringement or misappropriation may result in loss of revenue, substantial costs, or lead to monetary damages or injunctive relief against us.Information technology dependency and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, liability claims, or competitive harmThe Company is dependent on information technology (""IT"") systems and infrastructure for its business and manufacturing controls.  Our IT systems may be vulnerable to disruptions from human error, outdated applications, computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyber-attack and other similar disruptions.  Any significant disruption, breakdown, intrusion, interruption or corruption of these systems or data breaches could cause the loss of data, equipment damage, downtime, and/or safety related issues and could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Like other global companies, we have, from time to time, experienced incidents related to our IT systems, and expect that such incidents will continue, including malware and computer virus attacks, unauthorized access, systems failures and disruptions.  We have measures and defenses in place against unauthorized access, but we may not be able to prevent, immediately detect, or remediate such events.  A material breach in the security of our IT systems could include the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets.  Such disruptions or security breaches could result in the theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information, harm our competitive position, disrupt our manufacturing, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives, or otherwise adversely affect our business.Additionally, we believe that utilities and other operators of critical infrastructure that serve our facilities face heightened security risks, including cyber-attack.  In the event of such an attack, disruption in service from our utility providers could disrupt our manufacturing operations which rely on a continuous source of power (electrical, gas, etc.).We may not earn a positive return from our research, development and engineering investmentsDeveloping our products through our innovation model of research and development is expensive and often involves a long investment cycle.  We make significant expenditures and investments in research and development and four process engineering platforms that may earn an economic return.  If our investments do not provide a pipeline of new technologies that our customers demand or lower cost manufacturing platforms, it could negatively impact our revenues and operating margins both near- and long-term.We have significant exposure to foreign currency movements and to counterparties of our related derivatives portfolioA large portion of our sales, profit and cash flows are transacted in non-U.S. dollar currencies and we expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to these exposures.  We also maintain a significant portfolio of over the counter derivatives to hedge our projected currency exposure to the Japanese yen, New Taiwan dollar, South Korean won, Chinese yuan and euro.  We are exposed to potential losses in the event of non-performance by our counterparties to these derivative contracts.  Any failure of a counterparty to pay on such a contract when due could materially impact our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.13Table of ContentsFor example, we will experience foreign currency gains and losses in certain instances if it is not possible or cost effective to hedge our currency exposures or should we elect not to hedge certain currency exposures.  Alternatively, we may experience gains or losses if the underlying exposure which we have hedged change (increases or decreases) and we are unable to reverse, unwind, or terminate the hedges concurrent with the change in the underlying notional exposure.Our ultimate realized loss or gain with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency exposures that we enter into, the exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, whether we have entered into foreign currency contracts to offset these exposures and other factors.  Our hedge portfolio may reduce our flexibility to respond to price moves by our Display Technologies segment competitors.All of these factors could materially impact our results of operations, anticipated future results, financial position and cash flows, the timing of which is variable and generally outside of our control.If we are unable to obtain certain specialized equipment, raw and batch materials or natural resources required in our products or processes, our business will sufferOur ability to meet customer demand depends, in part, on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of equipment, parts and components from our suppliers.  We may experience shortages that could adversely affect our operations.  There can be no assurances that we will not encounter problems in the future.  Certain manufacturing equipment and components are available only from single or limited sources, and we may not be able to find alternate sources in a timely manner.  A reduction, interruption or delay of supply, or a significant increase in the price for supplies, such as manufacturing equipment, precious metals, raw materials, utilities including energy and industrial water, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses.We use specialized raw materials from single-source suppliers (e.g., specific mines or quarries) and natural resources (e.g., helium) in certain products and processes.  If a supplier is unable to provide the required raw materials or the natural resource is in scarce supply or not readily available, we may be unable to change our product composition or manufacturing process in order to prevent a disruption to our business.We have incurred, and may in the future incur, goodwill and other intangible asset impairment chargesAt December 31, 2016, Corning had goodwill and other intangible assets of $2.4 billion.  While we believe the estimates and judgments about future cash flows used in the goodwill impairment tests are reasonable, we cannot provide assurance that additional impairment charges in the future will not be required if the expected cash flow estimates as projected by management do not occur, especially if an economic recession occurs and continues for a lengthy period or becomes severe, or if acquisitions and investments made by the Company fail to achieve expected returns.Changes in our effective tax rate or tax liability may have an adverse effect on our results of operationsOur effective tax rate could be adversely impacted by several factors, including:·Changes in the relative amounts of income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates;·Changes in tax laws, tax treaties and regulations or the interpretation of them;·Changes to our assessment about the realizability of our deferred tax assets that are based on estimates of our future results, the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies, and the economic and political environments in which we do business;·The outcome of current and future tax audits, examinations, or administrative appeals;·Changes in generally accepted accounting principles that affect the accounting for taxes; and·Limitations or adverse findings regarding our ability to do business in some jurisdictions.14Table of ContentsWe may have additional tax liabilitiesWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions and are commonly audited by various tax authorities.  In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.  Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes.  Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.  The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made.A significant amount of our net profits and cash flows are generated from outside the U.S., and certain repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions may result in higher effective tax rates for the Company.  In addition, there have been proposals to change U.S. tax laws that could significantly impact how U.S. global corporations are taxed.  Although we cannot predict whether or in what form proposed legislation may pass, if enacted certain proposals could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow.Our innovation model depends on our ability to attract and retain specialized experts in our core technologiesOur innovation model requires us to employ highly specialized experts in glass science, ceramic science, and optical physics to conduct our research and development and engineer our products and design our manufacturing facilities.  The loss of the services of any member of our key research and development or engineering team without adequate replacement, or the inability to attract new qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance.We are subject to strict environmental regulations and regulatory changes that could result in fines or restrictions that interrupt our operationsSome of our manufacturing processes generate chemical waste, waste water, other industrial waste or greenhouse gases, and we are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of such substances.  We have installed anti-pollution equipment for the treatment of chemical waste and waste water at our facilities.  We have taken steps to control the amount of greenhouse gases created by our manufacturing operations.  However, we cannot provide assurance that environmental claims will not be brought against us or that government regulators will not take steps to adopt more stringent environmental standards.Any failure on our part to comply with any present or future environmental regulations could result in the assessment of damages or imposition of fines against us, or the suspension/cessation of production or operations.  In addition, environmental regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment, incur other significant compliance expenses or limit or restrict production or operations and thus materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.Changes in regulations and the regulatory environment in the U.S. and other countries, such as those resulting from the regulation and impact of global warming and CO2 abatement, may affect our businesses and their results in adverse ways by, among other things, substantially increasing manufacturing costs, limiting availability of scarce resources, especially energy, or requiring limitations on production and sale of our products or those of our customers.Current or future litigation or regulatory investigations may harm our financial condition or results of operationsAs described in Legal Proceedings in this Form 10-K, we are engaged in litigation and regulatory matters.  Litigation and regulatory proceedings may be uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, resulting in significant liabilities, penalties or damages.  Such current or future substantial legal liabilities or regulatory actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and reputation.Our global operations are subject to extensive trade and anti-corruption laws and regulations Due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of import- and export-related laws and regulations, including U.S. regulations issued by Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and Security, the Office of Anti-boycott Compliance, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and the Office of Foreign Assets Control, as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries.  Any alleged or actual violation by an employee or the Company may subject us to government scrutiny, investigation and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the United States.  We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.15Table of ContentsIn addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, or obtaining an unfair advantage.  Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws.  Our continued operation and expansion outside the United States, including in developing countries, could increase the risk of alleged violations.  Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition.Moreover, several of our related partners are domiciled in areas of the world with laws, rules and business practices that differ from those in the United States, and we face the reputational and legal risk that our related partners may violate applicable laws, rules and business practices.International trade policies may negatively impact our ability to sell and manufacture our products outside of the U.S. Government policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas, tariffs, and capital controls, whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs, can affect the demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us (including our equity affiliates/joint ventures) from being able to sell and/or manufacture products in certain countries.  The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as higher tariffs or new barriers to entry, in countries in which we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  For example, a government's adoption of ""buy national"" policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations.  These policies also affect our equity companies"
10,GLW,CORNING INC,2016-02-12,"  Risk Factors
We operate in rapidly changing economic and technological environments that present numerous risks, many of which are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict.  Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock or debt.  The following discussion of “risk factors” identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance.  This information should be read in conjunction with MD&A and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this report.  The following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider, as these factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical trends.As a global company, we face many risks which could adversely impact our ongoing operations and reported financial resultsWe are a global company and derive a substantial portion of our revenues from, and have significant operations, outside of the United States.  Our international operations include manufacturing, assembly, sales, research and development, customer support, and shared administrative service centers.Compliance with laws and regulations increases our costs.  These laws and regulations include U.S. laws and local laws which include data privacy requirements, employment and labor laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, prohibitions on payments to governmental officials, import and trade restrictions and export requirements.  Non-compliance or violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business.  Such violations could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results.  Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and manage these risks.We are also subject to a variety of other risks in managing a global organization, including those related to:·  General economic conditions in each country or region;·  Many complex regulatory requirements affecting international trade and investment, including anti-dumping laws, export controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local laws prohibiting improper payments.  Our operations may be adversely affected by changes in the substance or enforcement of these regulatory requirements, and by actual or alleged violations of them;·  Fluctuations in currency exchange rates, convertibility of currencies and restrictions involving the movement of funds between jurisdictions and countries;·  Sovereign and political risks that may adversely affect Corning’s profitability and assets;·  Geographical concentration of our factories and operations and regional shifts in our customer base;·  Periodic health epidemic concerns;·  Political unrest, confiscation or expropriation of our assets by foreign governments, terrorism and the potential for other hostilities;© 2016 Corning Incorporated. All Rights Reserved.  -11-Corning Index·  Difficulty in protecting intellectual property, sensitive commercial and operations data, and information technology systems generally;·  Differing legal systems, including protection and treatment of intellectual property and patents;·  Complex or unclear tax regimes;·  Complex tariffs, trade duties and other trade barriers including anti-dumping duties;·  Difficulty in collecting obligations owed to us such as accounts receivable;·  Natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, tsunamis and windstorms; and·  Potential power loss or disruption affecting manufacturing.Our sales could be negatively impacted by the actions of one or more key customers, or the circumstances to which they are subject, leading to the substantial reduction in orders for our productsIn 2015, Corning’s ten largest customers accounted for 45% of our sales.A relatively small number of customers accounted for a high percentage of net sales in our reportable segments.  For 2015, three customers of the Display Technologies segment accounted for 62% of total segment net sales when combined.  In the Optical Communications segment in 2015, two customers accounted for 22% of total segment net sales when combined.  In the Environmental Technologies segment in 2015, three customers accounted for 86% of total segment sales in aggregate.  In the Specialty Materials segment, three customers accounted for 56% of total segment sales in 2015 when combined.  In the Life Sciences segment, two customers accounted for 46% of total segment sales in 2015 in aggregate.  As a result of mergers and consolidations between customers, Corning’s customer base could become more concentrated.Our Optical Communications segment customers’ purchases of our products are affected by their capital expansion plans, general market and economic uncertainty and regulatory changes, including broadband policy.  Sales in the Optical Communications segment are expected to be impacted by the pace of fiber-to-the-premises deployments and data center expansions.  Our sales will be dependent on planned targets for homes passed and connected and construction of new and/or expansion of existing data centers.  Changes in our customers’ deployment plans could adversely affect future sales.In the Environmental Technologies segment, sales of our ceramic substrate and filter products for automotive and diesel emissions tend to fluctuate with vehicle production.  Changes in laws and regulations for air quality and emission controls may also influence future sales.  Sales in our Environmental Technologies segment are mainly to three catalyzers and emission system control manufacturers.  Our customers sell these systems to automobile and diesel engine original equipment manufacturers.  Sales in this segment may be affected by adverse developments in the global vehicle or freight hauling industries or by such factors as higher fuel prices that may affect vehicle sales or downturns in freight traffic.Certain sales in our Specialty Materials segment track worldwide economic cycles and our customers’ responses to those cycles.  In addition, any positive trends in prior years in the sales of strengthened glass may not continue.  We may experience losses relating to our inability to supply contracted quantities of this glass and processes planned to produce new versions of this glass may not be successful.Sales in our Life Sciences segment are concentrated with two large distributors who are also competitors, and the balance is to a variety of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, hospitals, universities, and other research facilities.  Changes in our distribution arrangements in this segment may adversely affect this segment’s financial results.Our operations and financial performance could be negatively impacted, if the markets for our products do not develop and expand as we anticipateThe markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies, evolving industry or regulatory standards and new product introductions.  Our success is dependent on the successful introduction of new products, or upgrades of current products, and our ability to compete with new technologies.  The following factors related to our products and markets, if they do not continue as in the recent past, could have an adverse impact on our operations:·  our ability to introduce advantaged products such as glass substrates for liquid crystal displays, optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment, and environmental substrate and filter products at competitive prices;·  our ability to manufacture glass substrates and strengthened glass, to satisfy our customers’ technical requirements and our contractual obligations; and·  our ability to develop new products in response to government regulations and laws.© 2016 Corning Incorporated. All Rights Reserved.  -12-Corning IndexWe face pricing pressures in each of our businesses that could adversely affect our financial performanceWe face pricing pressure in each of our businesses as a result of intense competition, emerging technologies, or over-capacity.  We may not be able to achieve proportionate reductions in costs or sustain our current rate of cost reduction to offset pricing pressures.  We anticipate pricing pressures will continue in the future in all our businesses.Any of these items could cause our sales, profitability and cash flows to be significantly reduced.We face risks due to foreign currency fluctuationsBecause we have significant customers and operations outside the U.S., fluctuations in foreign currencies, especially the Japanese yen, New Taiwan dollar, South Korean won, and euro, will significantly impact our sales, profit and cash flows.  Foreign exchange rates may make our products less competitive in countries where local currencies decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar and Japanese yen.  Sales in our Display Technologies segment, representing 34% of Corning’s sales in 2015, are denominated in Japanese yen.  Corning hedges significant translation, transaction and balance sheet currency exposures and uses a variety of derivative instruments to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities as well as operating results including our net profits.A large portion of our sales, profit and cash flows are transacted in non-U.S. dollar currencies and we expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to these exposures, net of gains or losses from our hedging programs.  For example, we will experience foreign currency gains and losses in certain instances if it is not possible or cost effective to hedge our foreign currency exposures or should we elect not to hedge certain foreign currency exposures.  Alternatively, we may experience gains or losses if the underlying exposure which we have hedged change (increases or decreases) and we are unable to reverse, unwind, or terminate the hedges concurrent with the change in the underlying notional exposure.  The objective of our hedging activities is to mitigate the risk associated with foreign currency exposures.  We are also exposed to potential losses in the event of non-performance by our counterparties to these derivative contracts.  Neither we nor our counterparties are required to post collateral for these financial instruments.  Our ultimate realized loss or gain with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency exposures that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, whether we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and other factors.  All of these factors could materially impact our results of operations, anticipated future results, financial position and cash flows, the timing of which is variable and generally outside of our control.If the financial condition of our customers declines, our credit risks could increaseWe have experienced, and in the future may experience, losses as a result of our inability to collect our accounts receivable.  If our customers or our indirect customers fail to meet their payment obligations for our products, we could experience reduced cash flows and losses in excess of amounts reserved.  Many customers of our Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments are thinly capitalized and/or unprofitable.  In our Optical Communications segment, certain large infrastructure projects are subject to governmental funding, which, if terminated, could adversely impact the financial strength of our customers.  These factors may result in an inability to collect receivables or a possible loss in business.The success of our business depends on our ability to develop and produce advantaged products that meet our customers’ needs Our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products.  To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to our customers, original equipment manufacturers and distributors.  This is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to manage and maintain key customer relationships, our ability to produce products that meet the quality, performance and price expectations of our customers.  The manufacturing of our products involves complex and precise processes.  In some cases, existing manufacturing may be insufficient to achieve the requirements of our customers.  We will need to develop new manufacturing processes and techniques to maintain profitable operations.  While we continue to fund projects to improve our manufacturing techniques and processes and lower our costs, we may not achieve satisfactory manufacturing costs that will fully enable us to meet our profitability targets.© 2016 Corning Incorporated. All Rights Reserved.  -13-Corning IndexIn addition, our continued success in selling products that appeal to our customers is dependent on our ability to innovate, with respect to both products and operations, and on the availability and effectiveness of legal protection for our innovations.  Failure to continue to deliver quality and competitive products to the marketplace, to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, to supply products that meet applicable regulatory requirements or to predict market demands for, or gain market acceptance of, our products, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our future financial performance depends on our ability to purchase a sufficient amount of materials, precious metals, parts, and manufacturing equipment to meet the demands of our customersOur ability to meet customer demand depends, in part, on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of materials, precious metals, parts and components from our suppliers.  We may experience shortages that could adversely affect our operations.  There can be no assurances that we will not encounter problems in the future.  Furthermore, certain manufacturing equipment, raw materials or components are available only from a single source or limited sources.  We may not be able to find alternate sources in a timely manner.  A reduction, interruption or delay of supply, or a significant increase in the price for supplies, such as manufacturing equipment, precious metals, raw materials or energy, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses.If our products, including materials purchased from our suppliers, experience performance issues, our business will sufferOur business depends on the production of products of consistently high quality.  Our products, components and materials purchased from our suppliers, are typically tested for quality.  These testing procedures are limited to evaluating our products under likely and foreseeable failure scenarios.  For various reasons, our products, including materials purchased from our suppliers, may fail to perform as a customer expected.  In some cases, product redesigns or additional expense may be required to address such issues.  A significant or systemic quality issue could result in customer relations problems, lost sales, reduced volumes, product recalls and financial damages and penalties.We have incurred, and may in the future incur, goodwill and other intangible asset impairment chargesAt December 31, 2015, Corning had goodwill and other intangible assets of $2,086 million.  In the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded a charge of $29 million for the impairment of goodwill resulting from a small acquisition in 2014.  While we believe the estimates and judgments about future cash flows used in the goodwill impairment tests are reasonable, we cannot provide assurance that additional impairment charges in the future will not be required if the expected cash flow estimates as projected by management do not occur, especially if an economic recession occurs and continues for a lengthy period or becomes severe, or if acquisitions and investments made by the Company fail to achieve expected returns.We operate in a highly competitive environmentWe operate in a highly competitive environment, and our outlook depends on the company’s share of industry sales based on our ability to compete with others in the marketplace.  The Company competes on the basis of product attributes, customer service, quality and price.  There can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with other companies’ products.  Our share of industry sales could be reduced due to aggressive pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors, unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties, product performance failures, our failure to price our products competitively, our failure to produce our products at a competitive cost or unexpected, emerging technologies or products.  We expect that we will face continuous competition from existing competitors, low cost manufacturers and new entrants.  We believe we must invest in research and development, engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities, and continue to improve customer service in order to remain competitive.  We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to maintain or improve our competitive position.We may need to change our pricing models to compete successfullyWe face intense competition in all of our businesses, particularly LCD glass, and general economic and business conditions can put pressure on us to change our prices.  If our competitors offer significant discounts on certain products or develop products that the marketplace considers more valuable, we may need to lower prices or offer other favorable terms in order to retain our customers and market positions.  Any such changes may reduce our profitability and cash flow.  Any broad-based change to our prices and pricing policies could cause our revenues to decline or be delayed as we implement and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies.  If we do not adapt our pricing models to reflect changes in customer use of our products or changes in customer demand, our revenues could decrease.© 2016 Corning Incorporated. All Rights Reserved.  -14-Corning IndexLCD glass generates a significant amount of the Company’s profits and cash flow, and any events that adversely affect the market for LCD glass substrates could have a material and negative impact on our financial resultsCorning’s ability to generate profits and operating cash flow depends largely upon the level of profitability of our LCD glass business.  As a result, any event that adversely affects our Display business could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial results.  These events could include loss of patent protection, increased costs associated with manufacturing, and increased competition from the introduction of new, and more desirable products.  If any of these events had a material adverse effect on the sales of our LCD glass, such an event could result in material charges and a significant reduction in profitability.Additionally, emerging material technologies could replace our glass substrates for certain applications, including display glass, cover glass and others, resulting in a decline in demand for our products.  Existing or new production capacity for glass substrates may exceed the demand for them.  Technologies for displays, cover glass and other applications in competition with our glass may reduce or eliminate the need for our glass substrates.  New process technologies developed by our competitors may also place us at a cost or quality disadvantage.  Our own process technologies may be acquired or used unlawfully by others, enabling them to compete with us.  Our inability to manufacture glass substrates to the specifications required by our customers may result in loss of revenue, margins and profits or liabilities for failure to supply.  A scarcity of resources, limitations on technology, personnel or other factors resulting in a failure to produce commercial quantities of glass substrates could have adverse financial consequences to us.Changes in our effective tax rate or tax liability may have an adverse effect on our results of operationsOur effective tax rate could be adversely impacted by several factors, including:·  changes in the relative amounts of income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates;·  changes in tax treaties and regulations or the interpretation of them;·  changes to our assessment about the realizability of our deferred tax assets that are based on estimates of our future results, the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies, and the economic environments in which we do business;·  the outcome of current and future tax audits, examinations, or administrative appeals;·  changes in generally accepted accounting principles that affect the accounting for taxes; and·  limitations or adverse findings regarding our ability to do business in some jurisdictions.We may have additional tax liabilitiesWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions and are commonly audited by various tax authorities.  In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.  Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes.  Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.  The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made.A significant amount of our net profits and cash flows are generated from outside the U.S., and certain repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions may result in higher effective tax rates for the company.  In addition, there have been proposals to change U.S. tax laws that could significantly impact how U.S. global corporations are taxed on foreign earnings.  Although we cannot predict whether or in what form proposed legislation may pass, if enacted certain anti-deferral proposals could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow.Our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employeesThe loss of the services of any member of our senior management team or key research and development or engineering personnel without adequate replacement, or the inability to attract new qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance.© 2016 Corning Incorporated. All Rights Reserved.  -15-Corning IndexWe are subject to strict environmental regulations and regulatory changes that could result in fines or restrictions that interrupt our operationsSome of our manufacturing processes generate chemical waste, waste water, other industrial waste or greenhouse gases, and we are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of such substances.  We have installed anti-pollution equipment for the treatment of chemical waste and waste water at our facilities.  We have taken steps to control the amount of greenhouse gases created by our manufacturing operations.  However, we cannot provide assurance that environmental claims will not be brought against us or that government regulators will not take steps toward adopting more stringent environmental standards.Any failure on our part to comply with any present or future environmental regulations could result in the assessment of damages or imposition of fines against us, or the suspension/cessation of production or operations.  In addition, environmental regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment, incur other significant compliance expenses or limit or restrict production or operations and thus materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.Changes in regulations and the regulatory environment in the U.S. and other countries, such as those resulting from the regulation and impact of global warming and CO2 abatement, may affect our businesses and their results in adverse ways by, among other things, substantially increasing manufacturing costs, limiting availability of scarce resources, especially energy, or requiring limitations on production and sale of our products or those of our customers.We may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights, which could result in loss of market share, and we may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of othersWe rely on patent and trade secret laws, copyright, trademark, confidentiality procedures, controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights.  Despite our efforts, these protections may be limited and we may encounter difficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights or obtaining rights to additional intellectual property necessary to permit us to continue or expand our businesses.  We cannot provide assurance that the patents that we hold or may obtain will provide meaningful protection against our competitors.  Changes in or enforcement of laws concerning intellectual property, worldwide, may affect our ability to prevent or address the misappropriation of, or the unauthorized use of, our intellectual property, potentially resulting in loss of market share.  Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights.  Litigation is inherently uncertain and outcomes are often unpredictable.  If we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use, or other misappropriation, we may not remain competitive.The intellectual property rights of others could inhibit our ability to introduce new products.  Other companies hold patents on technologies used in our industries and are aggressively seeking to expand, enforce and license their patent portfolios.  We periodically receive notices from, or have lawsuits filed against us by third parties claiming infringement, misappropriation or other misuse of their intellectual property rights and/or breach of our agreements with them.  These third parties often include entities that do not have the capabilities to design, manufacture, or distribute products or that acquire intellectual property like patents for the sole purpose of monetizing their acquired intellectual property through asserting claims of infringement and misuse.  Such claims of infringement or misappropriation may result in loss of revenue, substantial costs, or lead to monetary damages or injunctive relief against us.Current or future litigation or regulatory investigations may harm our financial condition or results of operationsAs described in Legal Proceedings in this Form 10-K, we are engaged in litigation and regulatory matters.  Litigation and regulatory proceedings may be uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, resulting in significant liabilities, penalties or damages.  Such current or future substantial legal liabilities or regulatory actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and reputation.We may not capture significant revenues from our current research and development efforts for several years, if at allDeveloping our products through research and development is expensive and the investment often involves a long return on investment cycle.  We have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development and related product opportunities.  Accelerated product introductions and short product life cycles require high levels of expenditures for research and development that could adversely affect our operating results if not offset by increases in our gross margin.  We believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position.© 2016 Corning Incorporated. All Rights Reserved.  -16-Corning IndexBusiness disruptions could affect our operating resultsA significant portion of our manufacturing, research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are concentrated in a few geographic areas.  A major earthquake, fire or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical facilities could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future financial results could be materially and adversely affected.Additionally, a significant amount of the specialized manufacturing capacity for our Display Technologies segment is concentrated in three overseas countries and it is reasonably possible that the operations of one or more such facilities could be disrupted.  Due to the specialized nature of the assets and the customers’ locations, it may not be possible to find replacement capacity quickly or substitute production from facilities in other countries.  Accordingly, loss of these facilities could produce a near-term severe impact on our Display business and the Company as a whole.We face risks through equity affiliates that we do not controlCorning’s net income includes equity earnings from affiliated companies.  For the year ended December 31, 2015, we recognized $299 million of equity earnings, of which approximately 94% came from Dow Corning (which makes silicone and high purity polycrystalline products).On December 11, 2015, Corning announced its intention to exchange its 50% equity interest in Dow Corning for 100% of the stock of a newly formed entity that will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Corning Incorporated.  The newly formed entity will hold approximately 40% ownership in Hemlock Semiconductor Group and approximately $4.8 billion in cash.  Upon completion of this strategic realignment, which is expected to close during the first half of 2016, Dow Chemical, an equal owner of Dow Corning with Corning since 1943, will assume 100% ownership of Dow Corning.Going forward, we face the risk that our other equity investments may not perform at the levels expected.  In addition, we rely on the internal controls and financial reporting controls of these entities and their failure to maintain effectiveness or comply with applicable standards or regulations may adversely affect us.We may not have adequate insurance coverage for claims against usWe face the risk of loss resulting from product liability, asbestos, securities, fiduciary liability, intellectual property, antitrust, contractual, warranty, environmental, fraud and other lawsuits, whether or not such claims are valid.  In addition, our product liability, fiduciary, directors and officers, property policies including business interruption, natural catastrophe and comprehensive general liability insurance may not be adequate to cover such claims or may not be available to the extent we expect in the future.  A successful claim that exceeds or is not covered by our policies could require us to make substantial unplanned payments.  Some of the carriers in our historical primary and excess insurance programs are in liquidation and may not be able to respond if we should have claims reaching their policies.  The financial health of other insurers may deteriorate.  Several of our insurance carriers are litigating with us the extent, if any, of their obligation to provide insurance coverage for asbestos liabilities asserted against us.  The results of that litigation may adversely affect our insurance coverage for those risks.  In addition, we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage for certain types of risk such as political risks, terrorism or war.Our global operations are subject to extensive trade and anti-corruption laws and regulations Due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of import- and export-related laws and regulations, including U.S. regulations issued by Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and Security, the Office of Antiboycott Compliance, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and the Office of Foreign Assets Control, as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries.  Any alleged or actual violations may subject us to government scrutiny, investigation and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the United States.  We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, or obtaining an unfair advantage.  Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws.  Our continued operation and expansion outside the United States, including in developing countries, could increase the risk of alleged violations.  Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition.© 2016 Corning Incorporated. All Rights Reserved.  -17-Corning IndexMoreover, several of our related partners are domiciled in areas of the world with laws, rules and business practices that differ from those in the United States, and we face the reputational and legal risk that our related partners may violate applicable laws, rules and business practices.Acquisitions, equity investments and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our businessWe expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into equity investments and strategic alliances as part of our business strategy.  These transactions involve significant challenges and risks including that a transaction may not advance our business strategy, that we do not realize a satisfactory return on our investment, or that we experience difficulty integrating new employees, business systems, and technology, or diversion of management’s attention from our other businesses.  It may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits, such as increased revenue and cash flow, enhanced efficiencies, or market share, or those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated, or may not be realized.  These events could harm our operating results or financial condition.Improper disclosure of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputationWe store and process personally-identifiable information of our employees and, in some case, our customers.  At the same time, the continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of the increasingly hostile information security environment.  This environment demands that we continuously improve our design and coordination of security controls across our business groups and geographies.  Despite these efforts, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and vendors on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information.  Improper disclosure of this information could harm our reputation or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.Significant macroeconomic events, changes in regulations, or a crisis in the financial markets could limit our access to capitalWe utilize credit in both the capital markets and from banks to facilitate company borrowings, hedging transactions, leases and other financial transactions.  We maintain a $2 billion revolving credit agreement to fund potential liquidity needs and to backstop certain transactions.  An adverse macroeconomic event or changes in bank regulations could limit our ability to gain access to credit or to renew the revolving credit agreement upon expiration.  Additionally, a financial markets crisis may limit our ability to access liquidity.Adverse economic conditions may adversely affect our cash investmentsWe maintain an investment portfolio of various types of securities with varying maturities and credit quality.  These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by unusual events that have affected global financial markets.  We also make significant investments in U.S. government securities, either directly, or through investment in money market funds.  If global credit and equity markets experience prolonged periods of decline, or if the U.S. defaults on its debt obligations or its debt is downgraded, our investment portfolio may be adversely impacted and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that could adversely impact our financial results.Information technology dependency and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, liability claims, or competitive harmThe Company is increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology and infrastructure.  Any significant breakdown, intrusion, interruption or corruption of these systems or data breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Like other global companies, we have, from time to time, experienced incidents related to our information technology (“IT”) systems, and expect that such incidents will continue, including malware and computer virus attacks, unauthorized access, systems failures and disruptions.  We have measures and defenses in place against unauthorized access, but we may not be able to prevent, immediately detect, or remediate such events.© 2016 Corning Incorporated. All Rights Reserved.  -18-Corning IndexWe use electronic IT in our manufacturing processes and operations and other aspects of our business.  Our IT systems may be vulnerable to disruptions from computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyber-attack and other similar disruptions.  A material breach in the security of our IT systems could include the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets.  Such disruptions or security breaches could result in the theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information, harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives, or otherwise adversely affect our business.Additionally, utilities and other operators of critical energy infrastructure that serve our facilities face heightened security risks, including cyber-attack.  In the event of such an attack, disruption in service from our utility providers could disrupt our manufacturing operations which rely on a continuous source of power (electrical, gas, etc.).International trade policies may impact demand for our products and our competitive position Government policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas, capital controls or tariffs, whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs, can affect the demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us (including our equity affiliates/joint ventures) from being able to sell products in certain countries.  The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as higher tariffs or new barriers to entry, in countries in which we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  For example, a government’s adoption of “buy national” policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations.  These policies also affect our equity companies"
0,GLW,CORNING INC,2015-02-13,"  Risk Factors
 We operate in rapidly changing economic and technological environments that present numerous risks, many of which are driven by factors that we cannot control or predict.  Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock or debt.  The following discussion of “risk factors” identifies the most significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance.  This information should be read in conjunction with MD&A and the consolidated financial statements and related notes incorporated by reference into this report.  The following discussion of risks is not all inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider, as these factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical trends.Index-10-  As a global company, we face many risks which could adversely impact our ongoing operations and reported financial resultsWe operate in over 100 countries and derive a substantial portion of our revenues from, and have significant operations, outside of the United States.  Our international operations include manufacturing, assembly, sales, customer support, and shared administrative service centers.Compliance with laws and regulations increases our cost of doing business.  These laws and regulations include U.S. laws and local laws which include data privacy requirements, employment and labor laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, prohibitions on payments to governmental officials, import and trade restrictions and export requirements.  Non-compliance or violations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business.  Such violations could result in prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results.  Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate and manage these risks.We are also subject to a variety of other risks in managing a global organization, including those related to:·  General economic conditions in each country or region;·  Many complex regulatory requirements affecting international trade and investment, including anti-dumping laws, export controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local laws prohibiting improper payments.  Our operations may be adversely affected by changes in the substance or enforcement of these regulatory requirements, and by actual or alleged violations of them;·  Fluctuations in currency exchange rates, convertibility of currencies and restrictions involving the movement of funds between jurisdictions and countries;·  Sovereign and political risks that may adversely affect Corning’s profitability and assets;·  Geographical concentration of our factories and operations and regional shifts in our customer base;·  Periodic health epidemic concerns;·  Political unrest, confiscation or expropriation of our assets by foreign governments, terrorism and the potential for other hostilities;·  Difficulty in protecting intellectual property, sensitive commercial and operations data, and information technology systems generally;·  Differing legal systems, including protection and treatment of intellectual property and patents;·  Complex or unclear tax regimes;·  Complex tariffs, trade duties and other trade barriers including anti-dumping duties;·  Difficulty in collecting obligations owed to us such as accounts receivable;·  Natural disasters such as floods, earthquakes, tsunamis and windstorms; and·  Potential power loss or disruption affecting manufacturing.Our sales could be negatively impacted by the actions of one or more key customers, or the circumstances to which they are subject, leading to the substantial reduction in orders for our productsIn 2014, Corning’s ten largest customers accounted for 48% of our sales.In addition, a relatively small number of customers accounted for a high percentage of net sales in our reportable segments.  For 2014, three customers of the Display Technologies segment accounted for 61% of total segment net sales when combined.  In the Optical Communications segment, one customer accounted for 11% of segment net sales.  In the Environmental Technologies segment, three customers accounted for 88% of total segment sales in aggregate.  In the Specialty Materials segment, three customers accounted for 51% of segment sales in 2014.  In the Life Sciences segment, two customers accounted for 45% of segment sales in 2014.  As a result of mergers and consolidations between customers, Corning’s customer base could become more concentrated.Our Optical Communications segment customers’ purchases of our products are affected by their capital expansion plans, general market and economic uncertainty and regulatory changes, including broadband policy.  Sales in the Optical Communications segment are expected to be impacted by the pace of fiber-to-the-premises deployments.  Our sales will be dependent on planned targets for homes passed and connected.  Changes in our customers’ deployment plans could adversely affect future sales.Index-11-  In the Environmental Technologies segment, sales of our ceramic substrate and filter products for automotive and diesel emissions tend to fluctuate with vehicle production.  Changes in laws and regulations for air quality and emission controls may also influence future sales.  Sales in our Environmental Technologies segment are mainly to three catalyzers and emission system control manufacturers.  Our customers sell these systems to automobile and diesel engine original equipment manufacturers.  Sales in this segment may be affected by adverse developments in the global vehicle or freight hauling industries or by such factors as higher fuel prices that may affect vehicle sales or downturns in freight traffic.Certain sales in our Specialty Materials segment track worldwide economic cycles and our customers’ responses to those cycles.  In addition, any positive trends in prior years in the sales of strengthened glass may not continue.  We may experience losses relating to our inability to supply contracted quantities of this glass and processes planned to produce new versions of this glass may not be successful.Sales in our Life Sciences segment are concentrated with two large distributors who are also competitors, and the balance is to a variety of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, hospitals, universities, and other research facilities.  In 2014, our two largest distributors accounted for 45% of Life Sciences’ segment sales.  Changes in our distribution arrangements in this segment may adversely affect this segment’s financial results.Our operations and financial performance could be negatively impacted, if the markets for our products do not develop and expand as we anticipateThe markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies, evolving industry or regulatory standards and new product introductions.  Our success is dependent on the successful introduction of new products, or upgrades of current products, and our ability to compete with new technologies.  The following factors related to our products and markets, if they do not continue as in the recent past, could have an adverse impact on our operations:·  our ability to introduce advantaged products such as glass substrates for liquid crystal displays, optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment, and environmental substrate and filter products at competitive prices;·  our ability to manufacture glass substrates and strengthened glass, to satisfy our customers’ technical requirements and our contractual obligations; and·  our ability to develop new products in response to government regulations and laws.We face pricing pressures in each of our businesses that could adversely affect our financial performanceWe face pricing pressure in each of our businesses as a result of intense competition, emerging technologies, or over-capacity.  While we work consistently toward reducing our costs to offset pricing pressures, we may not be able to achieve proportionate reductions in costs or sustain our current rate of cost reduction.  We anticipate pricing pressures will continue in the future in all our businesses.Any of these items could cause our sales, profitability and cash flows to be significantly reduced.We face risks due to foreign currency fluctuationsBecause we have significant customers and operations outside the U.S., fluctuations in foreign currencies, especially the Japanese yen, New Taiwan dollar, Korean won, and Euro, will significantly impact our sales, profit and cash flows.  Foreign exchange rates may make our products less competitive in countries where local currencies decline in value relative to the US dollar and Japanese yen.  Sales in our Display Technologies segment, representing 40% of Corning’s sales in 2014, are denominated in Japanese yen.  Corning hedges significant translation, transaction and balance sheet currency exposures and uses a variety of derivative instruments to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities as well as operating results including our net profits.Index-12-  A large portion of our sales, profit and cash flows are transacted in non-US dollar currencies and we expect that we will continue to realize gains or losses with respect to these exposures, net of gains or losses from our hedging programs.  For example, we will experience foreign currency gains and losses in certain instances if it is not possible or cost effective to hedge our foreign currency exposures or should we elect not to hedge certain foreign currency exposures.  Alternatively, we may experience gains or losses if the underlying exposure which we have hedged change (increases or decreases) and we are unable to reverse, unwind, or terminate the hedges concurrent with the change in the underlying notional exposure.  The objective of our hedging activities is to mitigate the risk associated with foreign currency exposures.  We are also exposed to potential losses in the event of non-performance by our counterparties to these derivative contracts.  However, we minimize this risk by maintaining a diverse group of highly-rated major international financial institutions with which we have other financial relationships as our counterparties.  We do not expect to record any losses as a result of such counterparty default.  Neither we nor our counterparties are required to post collateral for these financial instruments.  Our ultimate realized loss or gain with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of cross-currency exposures that we enter into, the currency exchange rates associated with these exposures and changes in those rates, whether we have entered into foreign currency forward contracts to offset these exposures and other factors.  All of these factors could materially impact our results of operations, anticipated future results, financial position and cash flows, the timing of which is variable and generally outside of our control.If the financial condition of our customers declines, our credit risks could increaseAlthough we have a rigorous process to administer credit and believe our bad debt reserve is adequate, we have experienced, and in the future may experience, losses as a result of our inability to collect our accounts receivable.  If our customers or our indirect customers fail to meet their payment obligations for our products, we could experience reduced cash flows and losses in excess of amounts reserved.  Many customers of our Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments are thinly capitalized and/or unprofitable.  In our Optical Communications segment, certain large infrastructure projects are subject to governmental funding, which, if terminated, could adversely impact the financial strength of our customers.  These factors may result in an inability to collect receivables or a possible loss in business.The success of our business depends on our ability to develop and produce advantaged products that meet our customers’ needs Our business relies on continued global demand for our brands and products.  To achieve business goals, we must develop and sell products that appeal to our customers, original equipment manufacturers and distributors.  This is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to manage and maintain key customer relationships, our ability to produce products that meet the quality, performance and price expectations of our customers.  The manufacturing of our products involves complex and precise processes.  In some cases, existing manufacturing may be insufficient to achieve the requirements of our customers.  We will need to develop new manufacturing processes and techniques to maintain profitable operations.  While we continue to fund projects to improve our manufacturing techniques and processes and lower our costs, we may not achieve satisfactory manufacturing costs that will fully enable us to meet our profitability targets.In addition, our continued success in selling products that appeal to our customers is dependent on our ability to innovate, with respect to both products and operations, and on the availability and effectiveness of legal protection for our innovations.  Failure to continue to deliver quality and competitive products to the marketplace, to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, to supply products that meet applicable regulatory requirements or to predict market demands for, or gain market acceptance of, our products, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Our future financial performance depends on our ability to purchase a sufficient amount of materials, precious metals, parts, and manufacturing equipment to meet the demands of our customersOur ability to meet customer demand depends, in part, on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of materials, precious metals, parts and components from our suppliers.  We may experience shortages that could adversely affect our operations.  Although we work closely with our suppliers to avoid shortages, there can be no assurances that we will not encounter problems in the future.  Furthermore, certain manufacturing equipment, raw materials or components are available only from a single source or limited sources.  We may not be able to find alternate sources in a timely manner.  A reduction, interruption or delay of supply, or a significant increase in the price for supplies, such as manufacturing equipment, precious metals, raw materials or energy, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses.Index-13-  If our products, including materials purchased from our suppliers, experience performance issues, our business will sufferOur business depends on the production of products of consistently high quality.  Our products, components and materials purchased from our suppliers, are typically tested for quality.  These testing procedures are limited to evaluating our products under likely and foreseeable failure scenarios.  For various reasons, our products, including materials purchased from our suppliers, may fail to perform as a customer expected.  In some cases, product redesigns or additional expense may be required to address such issues.  A significant or systemic quality issue could result in customer relations problems, lost sales, reduced volumes, product recalls and financial damages and penalties.We have incurred, and may in the future incur, goodwill and other intangible asset impairment chargesAt December 31, 2014, Corning had goodwill and other intangible assets of $1,647 million.  While we believe the estimates and judgments about future cash flows used in the goodwill impairment tests are reasonable, we cannot provide assurance that future impairment charges will not be required if the expected cash flow estimates as projected by management do not occur, especially if an economic recession occurs and continues for a lengthy period or becomes severe, or if acquisitions and investments made by the Company fail to achieve expected returns.We operate in a highly competitive environmentWe operate in a highly competitive environment, and our outlook depends on the company’s share of industry sales based on our ability to compete with others in the marketplace.  The Company competes on the basis of product attributes, customer service, quality and price.  There can be no assurance that our products will be able to compete successfully with other companies’ products.  Our share of industry sales could be reduced due to aggressive pricing or product strategies pursued by competitors, unanticipated product or manufacturing difficulties, product performance failures, our failure to price our products competitively, our failure to produce our products at a competitive cost or unexpected, emerging technologies or products.  We expect that we will face continuous competition from existing competitors, low cost manufacturers and new entrants.  We believe we must invest in research and development, engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities, and continue to improve customer service in order to remain competitive.  We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to maintain or improve our competitive position.We may need to change our pricing models to compete successfullyWe face intense competition in all of our businesses, particularly LCD glass, and general economic and business conditions can put pressure on us to change our prices.  If our competitors offer significant discounts on certain products or develop products that the marketplace considers more valuable, we may need to lower prices or offer other favorable terms in order to retain our customers and market positions.  Any such changes may reduce our profitability and cash flow.  Any broad-based change to our prices and pricing policies could cause our revenues to decline or be delayed as we implement and our customers adjust to the new pricing policies.  If we do not adapt our pricing models to reflect changes in customer use of our products or changes in customer demand, our revenues could decrease.LCD glass generates a significant amount of the Company’s profits and cash flow, and any events that adversely affect the market for LCD glass substrates could have a material and negative impact on our financial resultsCorning’s ability to generate profits and operating cash flow depends largely upon the level of profitability of our LCD glass business.  As a result, any event that adversely affects our Display business could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial results.  These events could include loss of patent protection, increased costs associated with manufacturing, and increased competition from the introduction of new, and more desirable products.  If any of these events had a material adverse effect on the sales of our LCD glass, such an event could result in material charges and a significant reduction in profitability.Additionally, emerging material technologies could replace our glass substrates for certain applications, including display glass, cover glass and others, resulting in a decline in demand for our products.  Existing or new production capacity for glass substrates may exceed the demand for them.  Technologies for displays, cover glass and other applications in competition with our glass may reduce or eliminate the need for our glass substrates.  New process technologies developed by our competitors may also place us at a cost or quality disadvantage.  Our own process technologies may be acquired or used unlawfully by others, enabling them to compete with us.  Our inability to manufacture glass substrates to the specifications required by our customers may result in loss of revenue, margins and profits or liabilities for failure to supply.  A scarcity of resources, limitations on technology, personnel or other factors resulting in a failure to produce commercial quantities of glass substrates could have adverse financial consequences to us.Index-14-  Changes in our effective tax rate or tax liability may have an adverse effect on our results of operationsOur effective tax rate could be adversely impacted by several factors, including:·  changes in the relative amounts of income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates;·  changes in tax treaties and regulations or the interpretation of them;·  changes to our assessments about the realizability of our deferred tax assets that are based on estimates of our future results, the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies, and the economic environments in which we do business;·  the outcome of current and future tax audits, examinations, or administrative appeals;·  changes in generally accepted accounting principles that affect the accounting for taxes; and·  limitations or adverse findings regarding our ability to do business in some jurisdictions.We may have additional tax liabilitiesWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions and are commonly audited by various tax authorities.  In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.  Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes.  Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals.  The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financial statements in the period or periods for which that determination is made.A significant amount of our net profits and cash flows are generated from outside the U.S., and certain repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions may result in higher effective tax rates for the company.  In addition, there have been proposals to change U.S. tax laws that could significantly impact how U.S. global corporations are taxed on foreign earnings.  Although we cannot predict whether or in what form proposed legislation may pass, if enacted certain anti-deferral proposals could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow.Our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employeesThe loss of the services of any member of our senior management team or key research and development or engineering personnel without adequate replacement, or the inability to attract new qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance.We are subject to strict environmental regulations and regulatory changes that could result in fines or restrictions that interrupt our operationsSome of our manufacturing processes generate chemical waste, waste water, other industrial waste or greenhouse gases, and we are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of such substances.  We have installed anti-pollution equipment for the treatment of chemical waste and waste water at our facilities.  We have taken steps to control the amount of greenhouse gases created by our manufacturing operations.  However, we cannot provide assurance that environmental claims will not be brought against us or that government regulators will not take steps toward adopting more stringent environmental standards.Any failure on our part to comply with any present or future environmental regulations could result in the assessment of damages or imposition of fines against us, or the suspension/cessation of production or operations.  In addition, environmental regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment, incur other significant compliance expenses or limit or restrict production or operations and thus materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.Changes in regulations and the regulatory environment in the U.S. and other countries, such as those resulting from the regulation and impact of global warming and CO2 abatement, may affect our businesses and their results in adverse ways by, among other things, substantially increasing manufacturing costs, limiting availability of scarce resources, especially energy, or requiring limitations on production and sale of our products or those of our customers.Index-15-  We may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights and we may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of othersWe rely on patent and trade secret laws, copyright, trademark, confidentiality procedures, controls and contractual commitments to protect our intellectual property rights.  Despite our efforts, these protections may be limited and we may encounter difficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights or obtaining rights to additional intellectual property necessary to permit us to continue or expand our businesses.  We cannot provide assurance that the patents that we hold or may obtain will provide meaningful protection against our competitors.  Changes in or enforcement of laws concerning intellectual property, worldwide, may affect our ability to prevent or address the misappropriation of, or the unauthorized use of, our intellectual property.  Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights.  Litigation is inherently uncertain and outcomes are often unpredictable.  If we cannot protect our intellectual property rights against unauthorized copying or use, or other misappropriation, we may not remain competitive.The intellectual property rights of others could inhibit our ability to introduce new products.  Other companies hold patents on technologies used in our industries and are aggressively seeking to expand, enforce and license their patent portfolios.  We periodically receive notices from, or have lawsuits filed against us by third parties claiming infringement, misappropriation or other misuse of their intellectual property rights and/or breach of our agreements with them.  These third parties often include entities that do not have the capabilities to design, manufacture, or distribute products or that acquire intellectual property like patents for the sole purpose of monetizing their acquired intellectual property through asserting claims of infringement and misuse.  Such claims of infringement or misappropriation may result in loss of revenue, substantial costs, or lead to monetary damages or injunctive relief against us.Current or future litigation or regulatory investigations may harm our financial condition or results of operationsAs described in Legal Proceedings in this Form 10-K, we are engaged in litigation and regulatory matters.  Litigation and regulatory proceedings may be uncertain, and adverse rulings could occur, resulting in significant liabilities, penalties or damages.  Such current or future substantial legal liabilities or regulatory actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and reputation.We may not capture significant revenues from our current research and development efforts for several years, if at allDeveloping our products through research and development is expensive and the investment often involves a long return on investment cycle.  We have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development and related product opportunities.  Accelerated product introductions and short product life cycles require high levels of expenditures for research and development that could adversely affect our operating results if not offset by increases in our gross margin.  We believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position.Business disruptions could affect our operating resultsA significant portion of our manufacturing, research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are concentrated in a few geographic areas.  A major earthquake, fire or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical facilities could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future financial results could be materially and adversely affected.Additionally, a significant amount of the specialized manufacturing capacity for our Display Technologies segment is concentrated in three overseas countries and it is reasonably possible that the operations of one or more such facilities could be disrupted.  Due to the specialized nature of the assets and the customers’ locations, it may not be possible to find replacement capacity quickly or substitute production from facilities in other countries.  Accordingly, loss of these facilities could produce a near-term severe impact on our Display business and the Company as a whole.We face risks through equity affiliates that we do not controlCorning’s net income includes equity earnings from affiliated companies.  For the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized $266 million of equity earnings, of which approximately 95% came from Dow Corning (which makes silicone and high purity polycrystalline products).Index-16-  Our equity investments may not continue to perform at the same levels as in recent years.  Dow Corning emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2004 and has certain obligations under its Plan of Reorganization to resolve and fund claims of its creditors and personal injury claimants.  Dow Corning may incur further bankruptcy charges in the future, which may adversely affect its operations or assets.  Dow Corning also could be adversely impacted by diminished performance at their consolidated subsidiary, Hemlock Semiconductor Group.  In addition, we rely on the internal controls and financial reporting controls of these entities and their failure to maintain effectiveness or comply with applicable standards may adversely affect us.We may not have adequate insurance coverage for claims against usWe face the risk of loss resulting from product liability, asbestos, securities, fiduciary liability, intellectual property, antitrust, contractual, warranty, environmental, fraud and other lawsuits, whether or not such claims are valid.  In addition, our product liability, fiduciary, directors and officers, property policies including business interruption, natural catastrophe and comprehensive general liability insurance may not be adequate to cover such claims or may not be available to the extent we expect in the future.  A successful claim that exceeds or is not covered by our policies could require us to make substantial unplanned payments.  Some of the carriers in our historical primary and excess insurance programs are in liquidation and may not be able to respond if we should have claims reaching their policies.  The financial health of other insurers may deteriorate.  Several of our insurance carriers are litigating with us the extent, if any, of their obligation to provide insurance coverage for asbestos liabilities asserted against us.  The results of that litigation may adversely affect our insurance coverage for those risks.  In addition, we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage for certain types of risk such as political risks, terrorism or war.Our global operations are subject to extensive trade and anti-corruption laws and regulations Due to the international scope of our operations, we are subject to a complex system of import- and export-related laws and regulations, including U.S. regulations issued by Customs and Border Protection, the Bureau of Industry and Security, the Office of Antiboycott Compliance, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls and the Office of Foreign Assets Control, as well as the counterparts of these agencies in other countries.  Any alleged or actual violations may subject us to government scrutiny, investigation and civil and criminal penalties, and may limit our ability to import or export our products or to provide services outside the United States.  We cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.In addition, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, or obtaining an unfair advantage.  Recent years have seen a substantial increase in the global enforcement of anti-corruption laws.  Our continued operation and expansion outside the United States, including in developing countries, could increase the risk of alleged violations.  Violations of these laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, could disrupt our business, and result in an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations or financial condition.Moreover, several of our related partners are domiciled in areas of the world with laws, rules and business practices that differ from those in the United States.  Although we strive to select equity partners and affiliates who share our values and understand our reporting requirements as a U.S.-domiciled company and to ensure that an appropriate business culture exists within these ventures to minimize and mitigate our risk, we nonetheless face the reputational and legal risk that our equity partners and affiliates may violate applicable laws, rules and business practices.Acquisitions, equity investments and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our businessWe expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into equity investments and strategic alliances as part of our business strategy.  These transactions involve significant challenges and risks including that a transaction may not advance our business strategy, that we do not realize a satisfactory return on our investment, or that we experience difficulty integrating new employees, business systems, and technology, or diversion of management’s attention from our other businesses.  It may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits, such as increased revenue and cash flow, enhanced efficiencies, or market share, or those benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated, or may not be realized.  These events could harm our operating results or financial condition.Index-17-  Improper disclosure of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputationWe store and process personally-identifiable information of our employees and, in some case, our customers.  At the same time, the continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of the increasingly hostile information security environment.  This environment demands that we continuously improve our design and coordination of security controls across our business groups and geographies.  Despite these efforts, it is possible our security controls over personal data, our training of employees and vendors on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information.  Improper disclosure of this information could harm our reputation or subject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.Significant macroeconomic events, changes in regulations, or a crisis in the financial markets could limit our access to capitalWe utilize credit in both the capital markets and from banks to facilitate company borrowings, hedging transactions, leases and other financial transactions.  We maintain a $2 billion revolving credit agreement to fund potential liquidity needs and to backstop certain transactions.  An adverse macroeconomic event or changes in bank regulations could limit our ability to gain access to credit or to renew the revolving credit agreement upon expiration.  Additionally, a financial markets crisis may limit our ability to access liquidity.Adverse economic conditions may adversely affect our cash investmentsWe maintain an investment portfolio of various types of securities with varying maturities and credit quality.  These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by unusual events that have affected global financial markets.  We also make significant investments in U.S. government securities, either directly, or through investment in money market funds.  If global credit and equity markets experience prolonged periods of decline, or if the U.S. defaults on its debt obligations or its debt is downgraded, our investment portfolio may be adversely impacted and we could determine that more of our investments have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that could adversely impact our financial results.Information technology dependency and security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, liability claims, or competitive harmThe Company is increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology and infrastructure.  Any significant breakdown, intrusion, interruption or corruption of these systems or data breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Like other global companies, we have, from time to time, experienced incidents related to our information technology (“IT”) systems, and expect that such incidents will continue, including malware and computer virus attacks, unauthorized access, systems failures and disruptions.  We have measures and defenses in place against unauthorized access, but we may not be able to prevent, immediately detect, or remediate such events.We use electronic IT in our manufacturing processes and operations and other aspects of our business.  Despite our implementation of security measures, our IT systems are vulnerable to disruptions from computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyber-attack and other similar disruptions.  A material breach in the security of our IT systems could include the theft of our intellectual property or trade secrets.  Such disruptions or security breaches could result in the theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information, harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives, or otherwise adversely affect our business.Additionally, utilities and other operators of critical energy infrastructure that serve our facilities face heightened security risks, including cyber-attack.  In the event of such an attack, disruption in service from our utility providers could disrupt our manufacturing operations which rely on a continuous source of power (electrical, gas, etc.).International trade policies may impact demand for our products and our competitive position Government policies on international trade and investment such as import quotas, capital controls or tariffs, whether adopted by individual governments or addressed by regional trade blocs, can affect the demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products or prevent us (including our equity affiliates/joint ventures) from being able to sell products in certain countries.  The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as higher tariffs or new barriers to entry, in countries in which we sell large quantities of products and services could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.  For example, a government’s adoption of “buy national” policies or retaliation by another government against such policies could have a negative impact on our results of operations.  These policies also affect our equity companies.Index-18- "

  Set forth below are some of theprincipal risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual business results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report or otherwise have a detrimental affect on the Company. These risks should beconsidered in making any investment decisions in Corning. Future results could be affected materially by general industry and market conditions, changes in laws or accounting rules, general economic and political conditions, including a globaleconomic slowdown, fluctuation of interest rates or currency exchange rates, terrorism, political unrest or international conflicts, political instability or major health concerns, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected businessconditions. These risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary comments concerning forward-looking statements in this Annual Report. Other risks not described above, or unknown to us, may also adversely affect Corning or itsresults.   8 We operate a global business in over 100 countries that exposes both our consolidated operations and ourequity method investments to additional risks. These include, but are not limited to, the following:     Reduced consumer demand for the products our customers manufacture, notably automobiles and heavy duty trucks, LCD televisions and notebook computersresulting in lower demand for the products we sell.   Increased competition resulting in lower sales, net income and cash flow.   Deterioration in the financial condition of our customers resulting in reduced sales, an inability to collect receivables, payment delays orpotentially their bankruptcy or insolvency.   Increased risk of insolvency of financial institutions, which may limit Cornings liquidity in the future or adversely affect its ability to useits revolving credit facility, or result in losses from hedged transactions or from counterparty risk on various financial transactions.   Increased turmoil in the financial markets may limit Cornings, its customers or its suppliers ability to access the capital marketsor may result in terms and conditions for such access that are more restrictive and costly than in the past.   Declines in our businesses that could result in material charges for restructuring or asset impairments.   Increased risk that financial investments by our customers, suppliers or equity companies may not achieve historical levels of liquidity.  Operations outside the U.S. are subject to many complex regulatory requirements affecting international trade and investment, including antidumpinglaws, export controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments. Our operations may be adversely affected by changes in the substance or enforcement of these regulatory requirements, and by actual or allegedviolations of them.   Emerging markets are a focus of our international growth strategy. The developing nature of these markets presents a number of risks, such asdeterioration of social, political, labor or economic conditions in a specific country or region and difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations may also adversely affect our operations or financial results.  Although we hedge a portion of our currency exposures, significant fluctuations in exchange rates may adversely affect our sales, net income and cashflow.   Increased sovereign risks in various countries may affect Cornings operations, expenses or assets in those countries. Our sales could be negatively impacted by the actions or circumstances of one or more key customers leading to thesubstantial reduction in orders for our products  In 2011, Cornings ten largest customers accounted for 51% of our sales. In addition, a relatively small number of customers accounted for a high percentage of net sales in our reportable segments. For 2011, fourcustomers of the Display Technologies segment accounted for 77% of total segment net sales when combined. In the Telecommunications segment, one customer accounted for 12% of segment net sales. In the Environmental Technologies segment, threecustomers accounted for 85% of total segment sales in aggregate. In the Specialty Materials segment, two customers accounted for 42% of segment sales in 2011. In the Life Sciences segment, two distributors accounted for 39% of segment sales in 2011.As a result of mergers and consolidations between customers, Cornings customer base could become more concentrated.  Samsung CorningPrecisions sales were also concentrated in 2011, with sales to two LCD panel makers located in South Korea accounting for approximately 93% of total Samsung Corning Precision sales.  Any positive trends in the sales of LCD glass substrates in previous years may not continue. Our customers are LCD panel and color filter makers. Additionally, consumer preferences for panels of differingsizes, designs, price, or other seasonal factors, may lead to pauses in market growth from time to time. Our customers may not be able to maintain their profitability or access sufficient capital to fund routine maintenance and operations or plannedexpansions which may limit their pace of orders to us. Emerging material technologies could replace our glass substrates for certain applications resulting in a decline in demand for our LCD products. Existing or new production capacity for glasssubstrates may exceed the demand for them. Technologies for displays in competition with LCD panels may reduce or eliminate the need for our glass substrates. These technologies may include organic light emitting diodes and plasma display panels.New process technologies developed by our competitors may also place us at a cost or quality disadvantage. Our own process technologies may be acquired or used unlawfully by others, enabling them to compete with us. Our inability to manufactureglass substrates in the sizes and quantities needed by our customers may result in loss of revenue, margins and profits or liabilities for failure to supply. A scarcity of resources, limitations on technology, personnel or other factors resulting ina failure to produce commercial quantities of very large-size glass substrates could have adverse financial consequences to us.   9 Our Telecommunications segment customers purchases of our products are affected by their capitalexpansion plans, general market and economic uncertainty and regulatory changes, including broadband policy. Sales in the Telecommunications segment are expected to be impacted by the pace of fiber-to-the-premises deployments by our customers suchas Bell Canada, Bell Aliant, NBN Co., and Verizon Communications Inc. Our sales will be dependent on planned targets for homes passed and connected. Changes in our customers deployment plans could adversely affect future sales in any quarteror for the full year.  In the Environmental Technologies segment, sales of our ceramic substrate and filter products for automotive and dieselemissions are expected to fluctuate with vehicle production. Changes in laws and regulations for air quality and emission controls may also influence future sales. Sales in our Environmental Technologies segment are mainly to three catalyzers andemission system control manufacturers. Our customers sell these systems to automobile and diesel engine original equipment manufacturers. Sales in this segment may be affected by adverse developments in the global vehicle or freight haulingindustries or by such factors as higher fuel prices that may affect vehicle sales or downturns in freight traffic.  Certain sales in ourSpecialty Materials segment track worldwide economic cycles and our customers responses to that cycle. In addition, any positive trends in prior years in the sales of strengthened glass for personal handheld devices and LCD television coverglass may not continue. We may experience losses relating to our inability to supply contracted quantities of this glass and processes planned to produce new versions of this glass may not be successful. Sales in our Life Sciences segment are through two large distributors, and the remaining balance is to a variety of government entities, pharmaceuticaland biotechnology companies, hospitals, universities and other research facilities. In 2011, our two largest distributors accounted for 39% of Life Sciences segment sales. Changes in our distribution arrangements in this segment may adverselyaffect this segments financial results.  If the markets for our products do not develop and expand as we anticipate, demand for ourproducts may decline, which would negatively impact our operations and financial performance  The markets for our products arecharacterized by rapidly changing technologies, evolving industry or government standards and new product introductions. Our success is expected to depend, in substantial part, on the successful introduction of new products, or upgrades of currentproducts, and our ability to compete with new technologies. The following factors related to our products and markets, if they do not continue as in the recent past, could have an adverse impact on our operations:    our ability to introduce leading products such as glass substrates for liquid crystal displays, optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment, andenvironmental substrate and filter products at competitive prices;   our ability to manufacture adequate quantities of increasingly larger glass substrates and strengthened glass for handheld devices, to satisfy ourcustomers technical requirements and our contractual obligations;   strong demand for notebook computers and LCD monitors;   growth in purchases of LCD televisions to replace other technologies;   screen size of LCD televisions, which affects glass demand;   our ability to develop new products in response to government regulations and laws, particularly diesel filter products in the EnvironmentalTechnologies segment;   growth of the fiber-to-the-premises build-out in North America, western Europe and Australia; and   growth in emerging markets in other geographic regions such as Brazil, Russia, India and China. We face pricing pressures in each of our leading businesses that could adversely affect our financial performance We face pricing pressure in each of our leading businesses as a result of intense competition, emerging new technologies, or over-capacity. While we workconsistently toward reducing our costs to offset pricing pressures, we may not be able to achieve proportionate reductions in costs or sustain our current rate of cost reduction. We anticipate pricing pressures will continue in the future in all ourbusinesses.   10 We face risks related to our international operations and sales We have customers and significant operations, including manufacturing and sales, located outside the U.S. We have large manufacturing operations forliquid crystal display glass substrates in Taiwan, China, Japan and Korea, including an equity investment in Samsung Corning Precision operating in South Korea that makes glass substrates for the Korean LCD market. All of our Display segmentcustomers are located in the Asia-Pacific region. As a result of these and other international operations, we face a number of risks, including:     geographical concentration of our factories and operations and regional shifts in our customer base;   periodic health epidemic concerns;   complexity of managing global operations;   difficulty in protecting intellectual property or sensitive commercial and operations data or information technology systems generally;  tariffs, duties and other trade barriers including anti-dumping duties;   differing legal systems, including protection and treatment of intellectual property and patents;   natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes; and   potential power disruption or loss affecting glass production and possibly causing equipment damage. Any of these items could cause our sales or profitability to be significantly reduced.  Additionally, a significant amount of the specialized manufacturing capacity for our Display Technologies segment is concentrated in three overseas countries and it is reasonably possible that theoperations of one or more such facilities could be disrupted. Due to the specialized nature of the assets and the customers locations, it may not be possible to find replacement capacity quickly or substitute production from facilities inother countries. Accordingly, loss of these facilities could produce a near-term severe impact on our Display business and the Company as a whole.  We face risks due to foreign currency fluctuations  Because we have significant customersand operations outside the U.S., fluctuations in foreign currencies, especially the Japanese yen, New Taiwan dollar, Korean won, and Euro, affect our sales and profit levels. Foreign exchange rates may make our products less competitive in countrieswhere local currencies decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar and Japanese yen. Sales in our Display Technologies segment, representing 40% of Cornings sales in 2011, are denominated in Japanese yen. If sales grow in our DisplayTechnologies segment, our exposure to currency fluctuations will increase. Corning hedges significant transaction and balance sheet currency exposures and uses derivative instruments to limit exposure to foreign currency fluctuations associated withcertain monetary assets and liabilities as well as operating results. Although we selectively hedge these items, changes in exchange rates (especially the Japanese yen to U.S. dollar) will significantly impact our reported revenues and profits. If the financial condition of our customers declines, our credit risks could increase Although we have a rigorous process to administer credit and believe our allowance is adequate, we have experienced, and in the future may experience,losses as a result of our inability to collect our accounts receivable. If our customers or our indirect customers fail to meet their payment obligations for our products, we could experience reduced cash flows and losses in excess of amountsreserved. Many customers of our Display Technologies and Specialty Materials segments are thinly capitalized and/or marginally profitable. In our Environmental Technologies segment, the U.S. auto makers and certain of their suppliers haveencountered credit downgrades or have filed for bankruptcy protection. These factors may result in an inability to collect receivables or a possible loss in business.  If we do not successfully adjust our manufacturing volumes and cost structure, or achieve manufacturing yields or sufficient product reliability, our operating results and cash flow could suffer, andwe may not achieve anticipated profitability levels  Investments in additional manufacturing capacity of certain businesses, includingliquid crystal display glass and diesel emission substrates and filters present challenges. We may face technical and process issues in moving to commercial production and there can be no assurance that Corning will be able to pace its capacityexpansion to the actual demand. Economic results may adversely affect our ability to complete planned capacity expansion and products. It is possible that manufacturing capacity may exceed or lag customer demand during certain periods.   11 The manufacturing of our products involves highly complex and precise processes, requiring production inhighly controlled and dust-free environments. Changes in our manufacturing processes could significantly reduce our manufacturing yields and product reliability. In some cases, existing manufacturing may be insufficient to achieve the requirementsof our customers. We will need to develop new manufacturing processes and techniques to achieve targeted volume, pricing and cost levels that will permit profitable operations. While we continue to fund projects to improve our manufacturingtechniques and processes, we may not achieve satisfactory cost levels in our manufacturing activities that will fully satisfy our profitability targets.  Our future financial performance depends on our ability to purchase a sufficient amount of materials, precious metals, parts, and manufacturing equipment components to meet the demands of our customers Our ability to meet customer demand depends, in part, on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of materials, preciousmetals, parts and components from our suppliers. We may experience shortages that could adversely affect our operations. Although we work closely with our suppliers to avoid shortages, there can be no assurances that we will not encounter theseproblems in the future. Furthermore, certain manufacturing equipment, raw materials or components are available only from a single source or limited sources. We may not be able to find alternate sources in a timely manner. A reduction, interruptionor delay of supply, or a significant increase in the price for supplies, such as manufacturing equipment, precious metals, raw materials or energy, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses. We have incurred, and may in the future incur, restructuring and other charges, the amounts of which are difficult to predict accurately We have recorded several charges for restructuring, impairment of assets, and the write-off of cost and equity-based investments in thepast. In 2011, we recorded a charge for the impairment of certain assets. Certain of our equity affiliates have also recorded restructuring charges. We and our affiliates may have additional actions that result in restructuring charges in thefuture.  We have incurred, and may in the future incur, goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges At December 31, 2011, Corning had goodwill and other intangible assets of $926 million. While we believe the estimates and judgments about futurecash flows used in the goodwill impairment tests are reasonable, we cannot provide assurance that future impairment charges will not be required if the expected cash flow estimates as projected by management do not occur, especially if an economicrecession occurs and continues for a lengthy period or becomes severe, or if acquisitions and investments made by the Company fail to achieve expected returns.  If our products, including materials purchased from our suppliers, experience performance issues, our business will suffer  Our business depends on the production of products of consistently high quality. Our products, components and materials purchased from our suppliers, are typically tested for quality. These testingprocedures are limited to evaluating our products under likely and foreseeable failure scenarios. For various reasons, our products, including materials purchased from our suppliers, may fail to perform as a customer expected. In some cases, productredesigns or additional expense may be required to address such an issue. A significant or systemic product quality issue could result in customer relations problems, lost sales, and financial damages. We face competition in most of our businesses  We expect that we will face continuous competition from existing competitors, low cost manufacturers and new entrants. We must invest in research and development, expand our engineering, manufacturing andmarketing capabilities, and continue to improve customer service and support in order to remain competitive. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to maintain or improve our competitive position. We may have additional tax liabilities We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision forincome taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We regularly are under audit by tax authorities. Although we believe our tax estimates arereasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our financialstatements in the period or periods for which that determination is made.   12 We earn a significant amount of our operating income from outside the U.S., and any repatriation of fundscurrently held in foreign jurisdictions may result in higher effective tax rates for the company. In addition, there have been proposals to change U.S. tax laws that would significantly impact how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreignearnings. Although we cannot predict whether or in what form this proposed legislation may pass, if enacted it could have a material adverse impact on our tax expense and cash flow.  Changes in our effective tax rate or tax liability may have an adverse effect on our results of operations  Our effective tax rate could be adversely impacted by several factors, some of which are outside of our control, including:    changes in the relative amounts of income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates;  changes in tax treaties and regulations and the interpretation of them;   changes to our assessments about the realizability of our deferred tax assets that are based on estimates of our future results, the prudence andfeasibility of possible tax planning strategies, and the economic environments in which we do business;   the outcome of current and future tax audits, examinations, or administrative appeals;   changes in generally accepted accounting principles that affect the accounting for taxes; and   limitations or adverse findings regarding our ability to do business in some jurisdictions. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Significantjudgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination could be materially different from our historical tax provisions and accruals. Accounting and disclosure rules may affect financial results  Generally accepted accounting principles and accompanying accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations for many areas of our business, such as revenue recognition, accountingfor investments, fair value estimates and accounting for stock options, are very complex and involve significant and sometimes subjective judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation could significantly impact our reported earnings andoperating income and could add significant volatility to those measures in the future, without a corresponding change in our cash flows. Our business depends on our ability to attract and retain talented employees  The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry is extremely competitive. We are limited in our ability to recruit internationally by restrictive domestic immigration laws. If we areless successful in our recruiting efforts, or if we are unable to retain key employees, our ability to develop and deliver successful products and services may be adversely affected. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-termsuccess. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. The loss of the services of any of our key research and development, engineering oroperational personnel or senior management without adequate replacement, or the inability to attract new qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance. We are subject to strict environmental regulations and regulatory changes that could result in fines or restrictions that interrupt our operations Various stages of our manufacturing processes generate chemical waste, waste water and other industrial waste and green-house gases, andwe are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of such substances. We have installed anti-pollution equipment for the treatment of chemical waste and waste water at our facilities. We have takensteps to control the amount of greenhouse gases created by our manufacturing operations. However, we cannot provide assurance that environmental claims will not be brought against us or that government regulators will not take steps toward adoptingmore stringent environment standards.  Any failure on our part to comply with any present or future environmental regulations could result inthe assessment of damages or imposition of fines against us, or the suspension/cessation of production or operations. In addition, environmental regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment, incur other significant compliance expenses orlimit or restrict production or operations and thus materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.   13 Changes in regulations and the regulatory environment in the U.S. and other countries,such as those resulting from the regulation and impact of global warming and CO2 abatement, may affect our businesses and their results in adverse ways by, among other things, substantially increasing manufacturing costs, limiting availability of scarce resources, especially energy,or requiring limitations on production and sale of our products or those of our customers.  We may experience difficulties in enforcing ourintellectual property rights and we may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others  We mayencounter difficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights or obtaining rights to additional intellectual property necessary to permit us to continue or expand our businesses. We cannot assure you that the patents that we hold or mayobtain will provide meaningful protection against our competitors. Changes in or enforcement of laws concerning intellectual property, worldwide, may affect our ability to prevent or address the misappropriation of, or the unauthorized use of, ourintellectual property. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights. Litigation is inherently uncertain and the outcome is often unpredictable. Other companies hold patents on technologies used in our industries and areaggressively seeking to expand, enforce and license their patent portfolios.  The intellectual property rights of others could inhibit ourability to introduce new products. We are, and may in the future be, subject to claims of intellectual property infringement or misappropriation that may result in loss of revenue, require us to incur substantial costs, or lead to monetary damagesor injunctive relief against us. We cannot assure you as to the outcome of any such claims.  Current or future litigation may harm ourfinancial condition or results of operations  Pending, threatened or future litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties. Our financialcondition or results of operations may be adversely affected by unfavorable outcomes, expenses and costs exceeding amounts estimated or insured. In particular, we have been named as a defendant in numerous lawsuits alleging personal injury fromexposure to asbestos, and adverse rulings in such lawsuits or the inability to successfully resolve such matters may adversely affect the Company. As described in Legal Proceedings, an amended PCC Plan of Reorganization was filed with the BankruptcyCourt on January 29, 2009 proposing a resolution of PCC asbestos claims. It remains reasonably possible that changes to the amended PCC Plan may be negotiated, and the elements of the plan and its approval are subject to a number ofcontingencies before the resolution outlined in that Plan becomes final.  We face risks through our equity method investments in companiesthat we do not control  Cornings net income includes significant equity earnings from associated companies. For the year endedDecember 31, 2011, we recognized $1.5 billion of equity earnings, of which 98% came from our two largest investments: Dow Corning (which makes silicone and high purity polycrystalline products) and Samsung Corning Precision (which primarilymakes liquid crystal display glass). Samsung Corning Precision is located in the Asia-Pacific region and is subject to political and geographic risks mentioned above, as well as business and other risks within the Display Technologies segment. Ourequity investments may not continue to perform at the same levels as in recent years. In 2007, we recognized equity losses associated with Samsung Corning Co., Ltd. (a 50% equity method investment that made glass panels and funnels for conventionaltelevisions), which recorded fixed asset and other impairment charges. Dow Corning emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2004 and has certain obligations under its Plan of Reorganization to resolve and fund claims of its creditors and personalinjury claimants. Dow Corning may incur further bankruptcy charges in the future, which may adversely affect its operations or assets.  Wemay not have adequate insurance coverage for claims against us  We face the risk of loss resulting from product liability, securities,fiduciary liability, intellectual property, antitrust, contractual, warranty, environmental, fraud and other lawsuits, whether or not such claims are valid. In addition, our product liability, fiduciary, directors and officers, property includingbusiness interruption, natural catastrophe and comprehensive general liability insurance may not be adequate to cover such claims or may not be available to the extent we expect in the future. Our insurance costs can be volatile and, at any time,can increase given changes in market supply and demand and our claim history. We may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage in the future at acceptable costs. A successful claim that exceeds or is not covered by our policies could requireus to pay substantial sums. Some of the carriers in our historical primary and excess insurance programs are in liquidation and may not be able to respond if we should have claims reaching their policies. The financial health of other insurers maydeteriorate. Several of our insurance carriers are litigating with us the extent, if any, of their obligation to provide insurance coverage for asbestos liabilities asserted against us. The results of that litigation may adversely affect ourinsurance coverage for those risks. In addition, we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage for certain types of risk such as political risks, terrorism or war.   14 Our businesses may be subject to increased regulatory enforcement Some of our reportable segments operate in industries with a concentrated number of competitors and customers, both foreign and domestic. While we haveadopted a corporate-wide compliance program, we may become the subject of antitrust or other governmental investigations from many jurisdictions that may adversely impact our reputation or our ability to make and sell products in the future. Acquisitions, joint ventures and strategic alliances may have an adverse effect on our business We expect to continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances as part of our long-term business strategy. Thesetransactions involve significant challenges and risks including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy, that we dont realize a satisfactory return on our investment, or that we experience difficulty integrating newemployees, business systems, and technology, or diversion of managements attention from our other businesses. It may take longer than expected to realize the full benefits, such as increased revenue, enhanced efficiencies, or market share, orthose benefits may ultimately be smaller than anticipated, or may not be realized. These events could harm our operating results or financial condition.  Improper disclosure of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation  Westore and process personally identifiable information of our employees and, in some cases, our customers. At the same time, the continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile tobreaches of information security. This environment demands that we continuously improve our design and coordination of security controls across our business groups and geographies. Despite these efforts, it is possible our security controls overpersonal data, our training of employees and vendors on data security, and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information. Improper disclosure of this information could harm our reputation orsubject us to liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue.  Adverse economicconditions may adversely affect our investments  We maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings, types, and maturities. Theseinvestments are subject to general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by unusual events that have affected global financial markets. A significant part of our investment portfolio consists of U.S. governmentsecurities. If global credit and equity markets experience prolonged periods of decline, or if the U.S. federal government budget process results in a default or downgrade of its debt, our investment portfolio may be adversely impacted and we coulddetermine that more of our investments have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in fair value, requiring impairment charges that could adversely impact our financial results.  Security vulnerabilities could lead to reduced revenue, liability claims, or competitive harm  We use electronic information technology (IT) in our manufacturing processes and operations and other aspects of our business. Despite our implementation of security measures, our IT systems arevulnerable to disruptions from computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyber attack and other similar disruptions. A material breach in the security of our IT systems could include the theft of our intellectual property or tradesecrets. To the extent that any disruptions or security breaches result in the theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information, it could harm our competitive position, reduce the value ofour investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives, or otherwise adversely affect our business.  Additionally,utilities and other operators of critical energy infrastructure that serve our facilities may face heightened security risks, including cyber attacks. In the event of such an attack, disruption in service from our utility providers could disrupt ourmanufacturing operations which rely on a continuous source of power (electrical, gas, etc)"
4,GLW,CORNING INC,2011-02-10,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
  Set forth below are some of the principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual business results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report orotherwise have a detrimental affect on the Company. These risks should be considered in making any investment decisions in Corning. Future results could be affected materially by general industry and market conditions, changes in laws or accountingrules, general economic and political conditions, including a global economic slowdown, fluctuation of interest rates or currency exchange rates, terrorism, political unrest or international conflicts, political instability or major health concerns,natural disasters or other disruptions of expected business conditions. These risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary comments concerning forward-looking statements in this Annual Report. Other risks not described above, orunknown to us, may also adversely affect Corning or its results.  As a result of ongoing volatility in the economies of the United Statesand many other countries, a number of the risks we normally face may increase in both our consolidated operations and at our equity method investments. These include:    Reduced consumer demand for the products our customers manufacture, notably automobiles and heavy duty trucks, LCD televisions and computer monitorsresulting in lowering demand for the products we sell.   Increased price competition resulting in lower sales, profitability and cash flow.   Deterioration in the financial condition of our customers resulting in reduced sales, an inability to collect receivables, payment delays orpotentially their bankruptcy or insolvency.   Increased risk of insolvency of financial institutions, which may limit Cornings liquidity in the future or adversely affect its ability to useits revolving credit facility, or result in losses from hedged transactions or from counterparty risk on various financial transactions.   Increased turmoil in the financial markets may limit Cornings, its customers or suppliers ability to access the capital markets ormay result in terms and conditions for such access that are more restrictive and costly than in the past.   Declines in our businesses that could result in material charges for restructuring or asset impairments.   Increased risk that financial investments by our customers, suppliers or equity companies may not achieve historical levels of liquidity.  8 Table of ContentsOur sales could be negatively impacted by the actions or circumstances of one or more key customersleading to the substantial reduction in orders for our products  In 2010, Cornings ten largest customers accounted for 55% of oursales.  In addition, a relatively small number of customers accounted for a high percentage of net sales in our reportable operating segments.For 2010, three customers of the Display Technologies segment accounted for 72% of total segment net sales when combined. In the Telecommunications segment, one customer accounted for 15% of segment net sales. In the Environmental Technologiessegment, three customers accounted for 86% of total segment sales in aggregate. In the Specialty Materials segment, three customers accounted for 43% of segment sales in 2010. In the Life Sciences segment, two distributors accounted for 37% ofsegment sales in 2010. As a result of mergers and consolidations between customers, Cornings customer base could become more concentrated.  Samsung Corning Precisions sales were also concentrated in 2010, with sales to two LCD panel makers located in South Korea accounting for approximately 93% of total Samsung Corning Precision sales. The sale of LCD glass substrates in 2010 and previous years provide no assurance that positive trends will continue. Our customers are LCDpanel and color filter makers. As they switch to larger size glass, the pace of their orders may be uneven while they adjust their manufacturing processes and facilities. Additionally, consumer preferences for panels of differing sizes, designs,price, or other seasonal factors, may lead to pauses in market growth from time to time. Our customers may not be able to maintain their profitability or access sufficient capital to fund routine maintenance and operations or planned expansionswhich may limit their pace of orders to us. Emerging material technologies could replace our glass substrates for certain applications resulting in a decline in demand for our LCD products. Technologies for displays in competition with LCD panelsmay reduce or eliminate the need for our glass substrates. These technologies may include organic light emitting diodes and plasma display panels. New process technologies developed by our competitors may also place us at a cost or qualitydisadvantage. Our inability to manufacture glass substrates in the sizes and quantities needed by our customers may result in loss of revenue, margins and profits or liabilities for failure to supply. A scarcity of resources, limitations ontechnology, personnel or other factors resulting in a failure to produce commercial quantities of very large-size glass substrates, particularly from facilities at a major customer in Japan, could have adverse financial consequences to us. Our Telecommunications segment customers purchases of our products are affected by their capital expansion plans, general market andeconomic uncertainty and regulatory changes, including broadband policy. Sales in the Telecommunications segment are expected to be impacted by the pace of fiber-to-the-premises deployments by our customers such as Bell Canada, Bell Aliant, NBN Co.,and Verizon Communications Inc. Our sales will be dependent on planned targets for homes passed and connected. Changes in our customers deployment plans could adversely affect future sales in any quarter or for the full year. In the Environmental Technologies segment, sales of our ceramic substrate and filter products for automotive and diesel emissions are expected tofluctuate with vehicle production. Changes in governmental laws and regulations for air quality and emission controls may also influence future sales. Sales in our Environmental Technologies segment are mainly to three catalyzers and emission systemcontrol manufacturers. Our customers sell these systems to automobile and diesel engine original equipment manufacturers. Sales in this segment may be affected by adverse developments in the global vehicle or freight hauling industries or by suchfactors as higher fuel prices that may affect vehicle sales or downturns in freight traffic.  Certain sales in our Specialty Materials segmenttrack worldwide economic cycles and our customers responses to that cycle. In addition, sales of strengthened glass for personal handheld devices and LCD television cover glass may fail to materialize. We may experience losses relating to ourinability to supply contracted quantities of this glass and new processes currently planned to produce this glass may not be successful. Sales in our Life Sciences segment are through two large distributors, and the remaining balance is to a variety of government entities, pharmaceuticaland biotechnology companies, hospitals, universities and other research facilities. In 2010, our two largest distributors accounted for 37% of Life Sciences segment sales. Changes in our distribution arrangements in this segment may adverselyaffect this segments financial results.   9 Table of ContentsIf the markets for our products do not develop and expand as we anticipate, demand for our products maydecline, which would negatively impact our results of operations and financial performance  The markets for our products are characterizedby rapidly changing technologies, evolving industry or government standards and new product introductions. Our success is expected to depend, in substantial part, on the successful introduction of new products, or upgrades of current products, andour ability to compete with new technologies. The following factors related to our products and markets, if not achieved, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations:    our ability to introduce leading products such as glass substrates for liquid crystal displays, optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment, andenvironmental substrate and filter products at competitive prices;   our ability to manufacture adequate quantities of increasingly larger glass substrates and strengthened glass for handheld devices, to satisfy ourcustomers technical requirements and our contractual obligations;   continued strong demand for notebook computers and LCD monitors;   growth in purchases of LCD televisions to replace other technologies;   screen size of LCD televisions, which affects glass demand;   our ability to develop new products in response to government regulations and laws, particularly diesel filter products in the EnvironmentalTechnologies segment;   growth of the fiber-to-the-premises build-out in North America, western Europe and Australia; and   growth in emerging markets in other geographic regions.  We face pricing pressures in each of our leading businesses that could adversely affect our financial performance  We face pricing pressure in each of our leading businesses as a result of intense competition, emerging new technologies, or over-capacity. While we work consistently toward reducing our costs to offsetpricing pressures, we may not be able to achieve proportionate reductions in costs or sustain our current rate of cost reduction. We anticipate pricing pressures will continue into 2011 and beyond in all our businesses. We face risks related to our international operations and sales  We have customers and significant operations, including manufacturing and sales, located outside the U.S. We have large manufacturing operations for liquid crystal display glass substrates in Taiwan,Japan and Korea, including an equity investment in Samsung Corning Precision operating in South Korea that makes glass substrates for the Korean LCD market. All of our Display segment customers are located in the Asia-Pacific region. As a result ofthese and other international operations, we face a number of risks, including:     geographical concentration of our factories and operations and regional shifts in our customer base;   periodic health epidemic concerns;   complexity of managing global operations;   difficulty in protecting intellectual property or sensitive commercial and operations data or information technology systems generally;  tariffs, duties and other trade barriers including anti-dumping duties;   differing legal systems;   natural disasters such as floods and earthquakes;   potential power disruption or loss affecting glass production and equipment damage;   political and economic instability in foreign markets; and   foreign currency risk. Any of these items could cause our sales or profitability to be significantly reduced.  Additionally, a significant amount of the specialized manufacturing capacity for our Display Technologies segment is concentrated in three overseas countries and it is reasonably possible that theoperations of one or more such facilities could be disrupted. Due to the specialized nature of the assets and the customers locations, it may not be possible to find replacement capacity quickly or substitute production from facilities inother countries. Accordingly, loss of these facilities could produce a near-term severe impact on our display business and the Company as a whole.   10 Table of ContentsWe face risks due to foreign currency fluctuations Because we have significant customers and operations outside the U.S., fluctuations in foreign currencies, especially the Japanese yen, New Taiwandollar, Korean won, and euro, affect our sales and profit levels. Foreign exchange rates may make our products less competitive in countries where local currencies decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar and Japanese yen. Sales in our DisplayTechnologies segment, representing 45% of Cornings sales in 2010, are denominated in Japanese yen. If sales grow in our Display Technologies segment, our exposure to currency fluctuations will increase. Corning hedges significant transactionand balance sheet currency exposures and uses derivatives instruments to limit exposure to foreign currency fluctuations associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities as well as operating results. Although we selectively hedge these items,changes in exchange rates (especially the Japanese yen to U.S. dollar) will significantly impact our reported revenues and profits.  If thefinancial condition of our customers declines, our credit risks could increase  Although we have a rigorous process to administer creditand believe our allowance is adequate, we have experienced, and in the future may experience, losses as a result of our inability to collect our accounts receivable. If our customers or our indirect customers fail to meet their payment obligationsfor our products, we could experience reduced cash flows and losses in excess of amounts reserved. Some customers of our Display Technologies segment are thinly capitalized and/or marginally profitable. In our Environmental Technologies segment, theU.S. auto makers and certain of their suppliers have encountered credit downgrades or have filed for bankruptcy protection. These factors may result in an inability to collect receivables or a possible loss in business. If we do not successfully adjust our manufacturing volumes and fixed cost structure, or achieve manufacturing yields or sufficient productreliability, our operating results and cash flow could suffer, and we may not achieve anticipated profitability levels  Investments inadditional manufacturing capacity of certain businesses, including liquid crystal display glass and diesel emission substrates and filters present challenges. We may face technical and process issues in moving to commercial production and there canbe no assurance that Corning will be able to pace its capacity expansion to the actual demand. Economic results may adversely affect our ability to complete planned capacity expansion and products. It is possible that manufacturing capacity mayexceed or lag customer demand during certain periods.  The manufacturing of our products involves highly complex and precise processes,requiring production in highly controlled and dust-free environments. Changes in our manufacturing processes could significantly reduce our manufacturing yields and product reliability. In some cases, existing manufacturing may be insufficient toachieve the requirements of our customers. We will need to develop new manufacturing processes and techniques to achieve targeted volume, pricing and cost levels that will permit profitable operations. While we continue to fund projects to improveour manufacturing techniques and processes, we may not achieve satisfactory cost levels in our manufacturing activities that will fully satisfy our profitability targets.  Our future financial performance depends on our ability to purchase a sufficient amount of materials, precious metals, parts, and manufacturing equipment components to meet the demands of our customers Our ability to meet customer demand depends, in part, on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of materials, preciousmetals, parts and components from our suppliers. We may experience shortages that could adversely affect our operations. Although we work closely with our suppliers to avoid shortages, there can be no assurances that we will not encounter theseproblems in the future. Furthermore, certain manufacturing equipment, raw materials or components are available only from a single source or limited sources. We may not be able to find alternate sources in a timely manner. A reduction, interruptionor delay of supply, or a significant increase in the price for supplies, such as manufacturing equipment, precious metals, raw materials or energy, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses. We have incurred, and may in the future incur, restructuring and other charges, the amounts of which are difficult to predict accurately We have recorded several charges for restructuring, impairment of assets, and the write-off of cost and equity-based investments in thepast. Certain of our equity affiliates have also recorded restructuring charges. We and our affiliates may have additional actions that result in restructuring charges in the future.   11 Table of ContentsWe have incurred, and may in the future incur, goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges At December 31, 2010, Corning had goodwill and other intangible assets of $716 million. While we believe the estimates and judgmentsabout future cash flows used in the goodwill impairment tests are reasonable, we cannot provide assurance that future impairment charges will not be required if the expected cash flow estimates as projected by management do not occur, especially ifan economic recession occurs and continues for a lengthy period or becomes severe, or if acquisitions made by the Company fail to achieve expected returns.  If our products, including materials purchased from our suppliers, experience performance issues, our business will suffer  Our business depends on the production of products of consistently high quality. Our products, components and materials purchased from our suppliers, are typically tested for quality. These testingprocedures are limited to evaluating our products under likely and foreseeable failure scenarios. For various reasons, our products, including materials purchased from our suppliers, may fail to perform as expected. In some cases, product redesignsor additional expense may be required to correct a defect. A significant or systemic product failure could result in customer relations problems, lost sales, and financial damages.  We face competition in most of our businesses  We expect that we will face continuouscompetition from existing competitors, low cost manufacturers and new entrants. We must invest in research and development, expand our engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities, and continue to improve customer service and support inorder to remain competitive. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to maintain or improve our competitive position.  Changes inour effective tax rate or tax liability may have an adverse effect on our results of operations  Our effective tax rate could be adverselyimpacted by several factors, some of which are outside of our control, including:     changes in the relative amounts of income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates;  changes in tax laws and the interpretation of those tax laws;   changes to our assessments about the realizability of our deferred tax assets that are based on estimates of our future results, the prudence andfeasibility of possible tax planning strategies, and the economic environments in which we do business;   the outcome of current and future tax audits, examinations, or administrative appeals;   changes in generally accepted accounting principles that affect the accounting for taxes; and   limitations or adverse findings regarding our ability to do business in some jurisdictions. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Significantjudgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination could be materially different from our historical tax provisions and accruals. Accounting and disclosure rules may affect financial results  Generally accepted accounting principles and accompanying accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations for many areas of our business, such as revenue recognition, accountingfor investments, fair value estimates and accounting for stock options, are very complex and involve significant and sometimes subjective judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation could significantly impact our reported earnings andoperating income and could add significant volatility to those measures in the future, without a corresponding change in our cash flows. We rely on key personnel and the loss of their services or the inability to attract and retain them may negatively affect our businesses Our ability to attract, retain and motivate qualified research and development, engineering and operating personnel, generally and duringperiods of rapid growth, especially in those of our businesses focused on new products and advanced manufacturing processes, is essential to our business success. We also depend on the services of experienced key senior management. The loss of the services of any of our key research and development, engineering or operational personnel or senior management without adequatereplacement, or the inability to attract new qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance.   12 Table of ContentsWe are subject to strict environmental regulations and regulatory changes that could result in fines orrestrictions that interrupt our operations  Our manufacturing process generates chemical waste, waste water and other industrial waste andgreen-house gases at various stages in the manufacturing process, and we are currently or may be in the future subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of such substances. We have installedanti-pollution equipment for the treatment of chemical waste and waste water at our facilities. We have taken steps to affect the amount of greenhouse gases created by our manufacturing operations. However, we cannot provide assurance thatenvironmental claims will not be brought against us or that government regulators will not take steps toward adopting more stringent environment standards.  Any failure on our part to comply with any present or future environmental regulations could result in the assessment of damages or imposition of fines against us, or the suspension/cessation ofproduction or operations. In addition, environmental regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment, incur other significant compliance expenses or limit or restrict production or operations and thus materially and negatively affect ourfinancial condition and results of operations.  Changes in regulations and the regulatory environment in the U.S. andother countries, such as those resulting from the regulation and impact of global warming and CO2 abatement, may affect our businesses and their results in adverse ways by, among other things, substantially increasing manufacturing costs, limiting availability of scarce resources, especially energy,or requiring limitations on production and sale of our products or those of our customers.  We may experience difficulties in enforcing ourintellectual property rights and we may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others  We mayencounter difficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights or obtaining rights to additional intellectual property necessary to permit us to continue or expand our businesses. We cannot assure you that the patents that we hold or mayobtain will provide meaningful protection against our competitors. Changes in or enforcement of laws concerning intellectual property may affect our ability to protect our intellectual property. Litigation may be necessary to enforce ourintellectual property rights. Litigation is inherently uncertain and the outcome is often unpredictable. Other companies hold patents on technologies used in our industries and are aggressively seeking to expand, enforce and license their patentportfolios.  The intellectual property rights of others could inhibit our ability to introduce new products. We are, and may in the future be,subject to claims of intellectual property infringement or misappropriation that may result in loss of revenue, require us to incur substantial costs, or lead to monetary damages or injunctive relief against us. We cannot assure you as to theoutcome of any such claims.  Current or future litigation may harm our financial condition or results of operations Pending, threatened or future litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties. Our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affectedby unfavorable outcomes, expenses and costs exceeding amounts estimated or insured. In particular, we have been named as a defendant in numerous lawsuits alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos, and adverse rulings in such lawsuits or theinability to successfully resolve such matters may adversely affect the Company. As described in Legal Proceedings, a new PCC Plan of Reorganization was filed with the Bankruptcy Court on January 29, 2009 proposing a resolution of PCC asbestosclaims. It remains reasonably possible that changes to this new PCC Plan may be negotiated, and the elements of the plan and its approval are subject to a number of contingencies before the resolution outlined in that Plan becomes final. We face risks through our equity method investments in companies that we do not control  Cornings net income includes significant equity in earnings of associated companies. For the year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized $2.0 billion of equity earnings, of which 98% came fromour two largest investments: Dow Corning (which makes silicone and high purity polycrystalline products) and Samsung Corning Precision (which primarily makes liquid crystal display glass). Samsung Corning Precision is located in the Asia-Pacificregion and is subject to political and geographic risks mentioned above, as well as business and other risks within the Display Technologies segment. Our equity investments may not continue to perform at the same levels as in recent years. In 2007,we recognized equity losses associated with Samsung Corning Co., Ltd. (a 50% equity method investment that made glass panels and funnels for conventional televisions), which recorded fixed asset and other impairment charges. Dow Corning emerged fromChapter 11 bankruptcy in 2004 and has certain obligations under its Plan of Reorganization to resolve and fund claims of its creditors and personal injury claimants. Dow Corning may incur further bankruptcy charges in the future, which may adverselyaffect its operations or assets.   13 Table of ContentsWe may not have adequate insurance coverage for claims against us We face the risk of loss resulting from product liability, securities, fiduciary liability, intellectual property, antitrust, contractual, warranty,environmental, fraud and other lawsuits, whether or not such claims are valid. In addition, our product liability, fiduciary, directors and officers, property including business interruption, natural catastrophe and comprehensive general liabilityinsurance may not be adequate to cover such claims or may not be available to the extent we expect in the future. Our insurance costs can be volatile and, at any time, can increase given changes in market supply and demand and our claim history. Wemay not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage in the future at acceptable costs. A successful claim that exceeds or is not covered by our policies could require us to pay substantial sums. Some of the carriers in our primary and excessinsurance programs are in liquidation and may not be able to respond if we should have claims reaching their policies. The financial health of other insurers may deteriorate. Several of our insurance carriers are litigating with us the extent, ifany, of their obligation to provide insurance coverage for asbestos liabilities asserted against us. The results of that litigation may adversely affect our insurance coverage for those risks. In addition, we may not be able to obtain adequateinsurance coverage for certain types of risk such as political risks, terrorism or war.  Our businesses may be subject to increasedregulatory enforcement  Some of our business segments operate in industries with a concentrated number of competitors and customers, bothforeign and domestic. While we have adopted a corporate-wide compliance program, we may become the subject of antitrust or other governmental investigations from many jurisdictions that may adversely impact our reputation or our ability to make andsell products in the future.  The acquisition of businesses by the Company may create liabilities or otherwise prove unsuccessful Acquisition of businesses by the Company may result in losses arising from undisclosed or unanticipated liabilities of such businesses,or from the failure of such business to achieve the financial results anticipated at the time of their acquisition.

1,GLW,CORNING INC,2010-02-10,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
  Set forth below are some of the principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual business results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements contained in this Report orotherwise have a detrimental affect on the Company. These risks should be considered in making any investment decisions in Corning. Future results could be materially affected by general industry and market conditions, changes in laws or accountingrules, general economic and political conditions, including a global economic slowdown, fluctuation of interest rates or currency exchange rates, terrorism, political unrest or international conflicts, political instability or major health concerns,natural disasters or other disruptions of expected business conditions. These risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary comments concerning forward-looking statements in this Annual Report. Additional risks not described above,or unknown to us, may also adversely affect Corning or its results.  As a result of the recession in the economies of the United States andmany other countries and volatility and uncertainty in global capital and credit markets, a number of the risks we normally face may increase in both our consolidated operations and at our equity method investments. These include:     Reduced consumer demand for the products our customers manufacture, notably automobiles and heavy duty trucks, LCD televisions and computer monitorswhich results in lowering demand for the products we sell.   Increased price competition resulting in lower sales, profitability and cash flow.   Deterioration in the financial condition of our customers resulting in reduced sales, an inability to collect receivables, payment delays orpotentially bankruptcy or insolvency.   Increased risk of insolvency of financial institutions, which may limit Cornings liquidity in the future or adversely affect its ability to useits revolving credit facility, or result in losses from hedged transactions or from counterparty risk on various financial transactions.   Increased turmoil in the financial markets may limit Cornings, its customers or suppliers ability to access the capital markets orrequire limitations or terms and conditions for such access that are more restrictive and costly than in the past.   Declines in our businesses that could result in material charges for restructuring or asset impairments.   Increased risk that financial investments by our customers, suppliers or equity companies may not achieve historical levels of liquidity. Our sales could be negatively impacted by the actions or circumstances of one or more key customers leading to thesubstantial reduction in orders for our products  In 2009, Cornings ten largest customers accounted for 52% of our sales.  8 Table of ContentsIn addition, a relatively small number of customers accounted for a high percentage of net sales in themajority of our reportable operating segments. For 2009, three customers of the Display Technologies segment accounted for 62% of total segment net sales when combined. In the Telecommunications segment, one customer accounted for 12% of segment netsales. In the Environmental Technologies segment, three customers accounted for 85% of total segment sales in aggregate. In the Life Sciences segment, two distributors accounted for 45% of segment sales in 2009. As a result of mergers andconsolidations between customers, Cornings customer base could become more concentrated.  Samsung Corning Precisions sales werealso concentrated in 2009, with sales to two LCD panel makers located in South Korea accounting for approximately 93% of total Samsung Corning Precision sales.  The sale of LCD glass substrates in 2009 and previous years provide no assurance that positive trends will continue. Our customers are LCD panel and color filter makers. As they switch to larger sizeglass, the pace of their orders may be uneven while they adjust their manufacturing processes and facilities. Additionally, consumer preferences for panels of differing sizes, designs, price, or other seasonal factors, may lead to pauses in marketgrowth from time to time. Our customers may not be able to maintain their profitability or access sufficient capital to fund routine maintenance and operations or planned expansions, which may limit their pace of orders to us. Emerging materialtechnologies could replace our glass substrates for certain applications resulting in a decline in demand for our LCD products. Technologies for displays in competition with LCD panels may reduce or eliminate the need for our glass substrates. Thesetechnologies may include organic light emitting diodes and plasma display panels. New process technologies developed by our competitors may also place us at a cost or quality disadvantage. Our inability to manufacture glass substrates in the sizesand quantities needed by our customers may result in loss of revenue, margins and profits or liabilities for failure to supply. A scarcity of resources, limitations on technology, personnel or other factors resulting in a failure to producecommercial quantities of very large size glass substrates, particularly from facilities at a major customer in Japan, could have adverse financial consequences to us.  Our Telecommunications segment customers purchases of our products are affected by their capital expansion plans, general market and economic uncertainty and regulatory changes, including broadbandpolicy. Sales in the Telecommunications segment are expected to be impacted by the pace of fiber-to-the-premises deployments by our customers such as Verizon Communications Inc. Our sales will be dependent on planned targets for homes passed andconnected. Changes in our customers deployment plans could adversely affect future sales in any quarter or for the full year.  In theEnvironmental Technologies segment, sales of our ceramic substrate and filter products for automotive and diesel emissions and pollution control are expected to fluctuate with vehicle production. Changes in governmental laws and regulations for airquality and emission controls may also influence future sales. Sales in our Environmental Technologies segment are mainly to three catalyzers and emission system component manufacturers. Our customers sell these systems to automotive originalequipment manufacturers and diesel engine manufacturers. Sales within this segment may be affected by adverse developments in the global vehicle or U.S. freight hauling industries or by such factors as higher fuel prices that may affect vehiclesales or downturns in freight traffic.  Sales in our Specialty Materials segment track worldwide economic cycles and our customersresponses to that cycle.  Sales in our Life Sciences segment are through two large distributors, and the remaining balance is to a variety ofgovernment entities, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, hospitals, universities and other research facilities. In 2009, our two largest distributors accounted for 45% of Life Sciences segment sales.

We face pricing pressures in each of our leading businesses that could adversely affect our financial performance  We face pricing pressure in each of our leading businesses as a result of intense competition, emerging new technologies, or over-capacity. While we will work toward reducing our costs to offset pricingpressures, we may not be able to achieve proportionate reductions in costs or to sustain our current rate of cost reduction We anticipate pricing pressures will continue into 2010 and beyond in all our businesses.  We face risks related to our international operations and sales  We have customers and significant operations, including manufacturing and sales, located outside the U.S. We have large manufacturing operations for liquid crystal display glass substrates in Taiwan,Japan and Korea, including an equity investment in Samsung Corning Precision operating in South Korea that makes glass substrates for the Korean LCD market.

Any of these items could cause our sales or profitability to be significantly reduced.  Additionally, a significant amount of thespecialized manufacturing capacity for our Display Technologies segment is concentrated in three overseas countries and it is reasonably possible that the use of one or more such facilities could be disrupted. Due to the specialized nature of theassets and the customers locations, it may not be possible to find replacement capacity quickly or substitute production from facilities in other countries. Accordingly, loss of these facilities could produce a near-term severe impact on ourdisplay business and the Company as a whole.  We face risks due to foreign currency fluctuations  Because we have significant customers and operations outside the U.S., fluctuations in foreign currencies, especially the Japanese yen, New Taiwan dollar,Korean won, and euro, affect our sales and profit levels. Foreign exchange rates may make our products less competitive in countries where local currencies decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar and Japanese yen. Sales in our DisplayTechnologies segment, representing 45% of Cornings sales in 2009, are denominated in Japanese yen. If sales grow in our Display Technologies segment, that will increase our exposure to currency fluctuations. Corning hedges significanttransaction and balance sheet currency exposures and uses derivatives instruments to limit exposure to foreign currency fluctuations associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities as well as operating results. Although we selectively hedgethese items, changes in exchange rates (especially the Japanese yen to U.S. dollar) may significantly impact our reported revenues and profits.  If the financial condition of our customers declines, our credit risks could increase  Although we have a rigorous process toadminister credit and believe our reserve is adequate, we have experienced, and in the future may experience, losses as a result of our inability to collect our accounts receivable. If our customers or our indirect customers fail to meet theirpayment obligations for our products, we could experience reduced cash flows and losses in excess of amounts reserved. Some customers of our Display Technologies segment are thinly capitalized and/or marginally profitable. In our EnvironmentalTechnologies segment, the U.S. auto makers and certain of their suppliers have encountered credit downgrades or have filed for bankruptcy protection. These factors may result in an inability to collect receivables or a possible loss in business. Asof December 31, 2009 reserves and allowances for trade receivables totaled approximately $20 million.   10 Table of ContentsIf we do not successfully adjust our manufacturing volumes and fixed cost structure, or achievemanufacturing yields or sufficient product reliability, our operating results and cash flow could suffer, and we may not achieve anticipated profitability levels  Investments in additional manufacturing capacity of certain businesses, including liquid crystal display glass and diesel emission substrates and filters present challenges.

We have incurred, and may in the future incur, restructuring and other charges, the amounts of which are difficult to predict accurately We have recorded several charges for restructuring, impairment of assets, and the write-off of cost and equity-based investments. As aresult of the decline in the economy and its impact on Cornings businesses, we recorded restructuring charges of $228 million in 2009. Certain of our equity affiliates have also recorded restructuring charges. We and our affiliates may haveadditional actions that result in restructuring charges in the future.

We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to maintain or improve our competitive position.   11 Table of ContentsChanges in our effective tax rate or tax liability may have an adverse effect on our results ofoperations  Our effective tax rate could be adversely impacted by several factors, some of which are outside of our control, including:    changes in the relative amounts of income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates;  changes in tax laws and the interpretation of those tax laws;   changes to our assessments about the realizability of our deferred tax assets that are based on estimates of our future results, the prudence andfeasibility of possible tax planning strategies, and the economic environments in which we do business;   the outcome of current and future tax audits, examinations, or administrative appeals;   changes in generally accepted accounting principles that affect the accounting for taxes; and   limitations or adverse findings regarding our ability to do business in some jurisdictions.  In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Significant judgmentis required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination could be materially different from our historical tax provisions and accruals.  Accounting and disclosure rules may affect financial results  Generally accepted accounting principles and accompanying accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations for many areas of our business, such as revenue recognition, accountingfor investments, and accounting for stock options, are very complex and involve significant and sometimes subjective judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation could significantly impact our reported earnings and operating income andcould add significant volatility to those measures in the future, without a corresponding change in our cash flows.  We rely on keypersonnel and the loss of their services or the inability to attract and retain them may negatively affect our businesses  Our ability tocontinue to attract, retain and motivate qualified research and development, engineering and operating personnel, generally and during periods of rapid growth, especially in those of our businesses focused on new products and advanced manufacturingprocesses, is essential to our business success. We also depend on the services of experienced key senior management.  The loss of theservices of any of our key research and development, engineering or operational personnel or senior management without adequate replacement, or the inability to attract new qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our operationsand financial performance.  We are subject to strict environmental regulations and regulatory changes that could result in fines orrestrictions that interrupt our operations  Our manufacturing process generates chemical waste, waste water and other industrial waste andvarious green house gases at various stages in the manufacturing process, and we are currently or may be in the future subject to a variety of laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of such substances. We haveinstalled various types of anti-pollution equipment for the treatment of chemical waste and waste water at our various facilities. We have taken steps to affect the amount of greenhouse gases created by our manufacturing operations. However, wecannot provide assurance that environmental claims will not be brought against us or that the local or national governments will not take steps toward adopting more stringent environment standards.  Any failure on our part to comply with any present or future environmental regulations could result in the assessment of damages or imposition of finesagainst us, or the suspension/cessation of production or operations. In addition, environmental regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment, incur other significant compliance expenses or limit or restrict production or operations andthus materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.  Changes in regulations and theregulatory environment in the U.S. and other countries, such as those resulting from the regulation and impact of global warming and CO2 abatement, may affect our businesses and their results in adverse ways by, among other things, substantially increasingmanufacturing costs, limiting availability of scarce resources, especially energy, or requiring limitations on production and sale of our products or those of our customers.   12 Table of ContentsWe may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights and we may be subject toclaims of infringement of the intellectual property rights of others  We may encounter difficulties in protecting our intellectualproperty rights or obtaining rights to additional intellectual property necessary to permit us to continue or expand our businesses. We cannot assure you that the patents that we hold or may obtain will provide meaningful protection against ourcompetitors. Changes in laws concerning intellectual property may affect our ability to protect our intellectual property. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights. Litigation is inherently uncertain and the outcome isoften unpredictable. Other companies hold patents on technologies used in our industries and are aggressively seeking to expand, enforce and license their patent portfolios.  The intellectual property rights of others could inhibit our ability to introduce new products. We are, and may in the future be, subject to claims of intellectual property infringement ormisappropriation that may result in loss of revenue, require us to incur substantial costs, or lead to monetary damages or injunctive relief against us. We cannot assure you as to the outcome of any such claims.  Current or future litigation may harm our financial condition or results of operations  Pending, threatened or future litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties. Our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected by unfavorable outcomes, expenses and costsexceeding amounts estimated or insured. In particular, we have been named as a defendant in numerous lawsuits alleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos, and adverse rulings in such lawsuits or the inability to successfully resolve suchmatters may adversely affect the Company. As described in Legal Proceedings, a new PCC Plan of Reorganization was filed with the Bankruptcy Court on January 29, 2009 proposing a resolution of PCC asbestos claims. It remains reasonably possiblethat changes to the Amended PCC Plan may be negotiated, and the elements of the plan and its approval are subject to a number of contingencies before the resolution outlined in the Plan becomes final.  We face risks through our equity method investments in companies that we do not control  Cornings net income includes significant equity in earnings of associated companies. For the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized $1.4billion of equity earnings, of which 98% came from our two largest investments: Dow Corning (which makes silicone and high purity polycrystalline products) and Samsung Corning Precision (which primarily makes liquid crystal display glass). SamsungCorning Precision is located in the Asia-Pacific region and is subject to political and geographic risks mentioned above, as well as business and other risks within the Display segment. Our equity investments may not continue to perform at the samelevels as in recent years. In 2007, we recognized equity losses associated with Samsung Corning Co., Ltd. (a 50% equity method investment that made glass panels and funnels for conventional televisions), which recorded fixed asset and otherimpairment charges. Dow Corning emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2004 and has certain obligations under its Plan of Reorganization to resolve and fund claims of its creditors and personal injury claimants. Dow Corning may incur furtherbankruptcy charges in the future, which may adversely affect its operations or assets.  We may not have adequate insurance coverage forclaims against us  We face the risk of loss resulting from product liability, securities, fiduciary liability, intellectual property,antitrust, contractual, warranty, environmental, fraud and other lawsuits, whether or not such claims are valid. In addition, our product liability, fiduciary, directors and officers, property including business interruption, natural catastrophe andcomprehensive general liability insurance may not be adequate to cover such claims or may not be available to the extent we expect in the future. Our insurance costs can be volatile and, at any time, can increase given changes in market supply anddemand and our claim history. We may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage in the future at acceptable costs. A successful claim that exceeds or is not covered by our policies could require us to pay substantial sums. Some of thecarriers in our primary and excess insurance programs are in liquidation and may not be able to respond if we should have claims reaching into their layers. The financial health of other insurers may deteriorate. Several of our insurance carriersare litigating with us the extent, if any, of their obligation to provide insurance coverage for asbestos liabilities asserted against us. The results of that litigation may adversely affect our insurance coverage for those risks. In addition, wemay not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage for certain types of risk such as political risks, terrorism or war.  Our businessesmay be subject to increased regulatory enforcement  Some of our business segments operate in industries with a concentrated number ofcompetitors and customers both foreign and domestic. While we have adopted a corporate-wide compliance program, we may become the subject of antitrust or other governmental investigations from many jurisdictions that may adversely impact ourreputation or our ability to make and sell products in the future.   13 Table of ContentsOther  Additional information in response to Item 1 is found in Note 20 (Operating Segments) to the Consolidated Financial Statements and in Item 6 (Selected Financial Data)"
3,GLW,CORNING INC,2009-02-24,">Item 1A.    Risk Factors
  Set forth below are some of the principal risks and uncertainties that couldcause our actual business results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements contained in this Report or otherwise have a detrimental affect on the company. These risks should be considered in making any investment decisions inCorning. Future results could be materially affected by general industry and market conditions, changes in laws or accounting rules, general economic and political conditions, including a global economic slowdown, fluctuation of interest rates orcurrency exchange rates, terrorism, political unrest or international conflicts, political instability or major health concerns, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected business conditions. These risk factors should be considered inaddition to our cautionary comments concerning forward-looking statements in this Annual Report. Additional risks not described above, or unknown to us, may also adversely affect Corning or its results.  As a result of the current recession in the economies of the United States and many other countries and volatility and uncertainty in global capital and creditmarkets, a number of the risks we normally face may increase in both our consolidated operations and at our equity method investments. These include:     Reduced consumer demand for the products our customers manufacture, notably automobiles and heavy duty trucks, LCD televisions and computer monitors which resultsin lowering demand for the products we sell.   Increased price competition resulting in lower sales, profitability and cash flow.   Deterioration in the financial condition of our customers resulting in reduced sales, an inability to collect receivables, payment delays or potentially bankruptcyor insolvency.   Increased risk of insolvency of financial institutions, which may limit Cornings liquidity in the future or adversely affect its ability to use its revolvingcredit facility, or result in losses from hedged transactions or from counterparty risk on various financial transactions.   Increased turmoil in the financial markets may limit Cornings, its customers or suppliers ability to access the capital markets or requirelimitations or terms and conditions for such access that are more restrictive and costly than in the past.   Declines in our businesses that could result in material charges for restructuring or asset impairments.   Increased risk that financial investments by our customers, suppliers or equity companies may not achieve historical levels of liquidity. Our sales could be negatively impacted by the actions or circumstances of one or more key customers leading to the substantialreduction in orders for our products  Cornings ten largest customers account for about 54% of our sales. There are two individual customers whichaccounted for more than 10% of Cornings consolidated sales in 2008. AU Optronics Corporation (AUO) and Chi Mei Optoelectronics Corporation (Chi Mei), two customers of the Display Technologies segment, accounted for 11% and 10%, respectively,of consolidated sales in 2008.  In addition, a relatively small number of customers accounted for a high percentage of net sales in each of our reportableoperating segments. For 2008, three customers of the Display Technologies segment accounted for 65% of total segment net sales when combined. In the Telecommunications segment, two customers accounted for 24% of segment net sales when combined. Inthe Environmental Technologies segment, three customers accounted for 81% of total segment sales in aggregate. In the Specialty Materials segment, one customer accounted for 11% of segment sales in 2008. In the Life Sciences segment, one distributoraccounted for 45% of segment sales in 2008.  Samsung Corning Precisions sales were also concentrated in 2008, with sales to two LCD panel makerslocated in South Korea accounting for approximately 94% of total Samsung Corning Precision sales.   8 Table of ContentsThe sale of LCD glass substrates in 2008 and previous years provide no assurance that positive trends will continue. Ourcustomers are LCD panel and color filter makers. As they switch to larger size glass, the pace of their orders may be uneven while they adjust their manufacturing processes and facilities. Additionally, consumer preferences for panels of differingsizes, price, or other seasonal factors, may lead to pauses in market growth from time to time. Our customers may not be able to maintain their profitability or access sufficient capital to fund routine maintenance and operations or plannedexpansions, which may limit their pace of orders to us. Emerging material technologies could replace our glass substrates for certain applications resulting in a decline in demand for our LCD products. Technologies for displays in competition withLCD panels may reduce or eliminate the need for our glass substrate. These technologies may include organic light emitting diodes and plasma display panels. New process technologies developed by our competitors may also place us at a cost or qualitydisadvantage. Our inability to manufacture glass substrates in the sizes and quantities needed by our customers may result in loss of revenue, margins and profits or liabilities for failure to supply. A scarcity of resources, limitations ontechnology, personnel or other factors resulting in a failure to produce commercial quantities of very large size glass substrates, particularly from new facilities being constructed at a major customer in Japan, could have adverse financialconsequences to us.  Our Telecommunications segment customers purchases of our products are affected by their capital expansion plans, general marketand economic uncertainty and regulatory changes, including broadband policy. Sales in the Telecommunications segment are expected to be impacted by the pace of fiber-to-the-premises deployments by our customers such as Verizon Communications Inc.Our sales will be dependent on planned targets for homes passed and connected. Changes in our customers deployment plans could adversely affect future sales in any quarter or for the full year.  In the Environmental Technologies segment, sales of our ceramic substrate and filter products for automotive and diesel emissions and pollution control are expected tofluctuate with vehicle production. Changes in governmental laws and regulations for air quality and emission controls may also influence future sales. Sales in our Environmental Technologies segment are mainly to three catalyzers and emission systemcomponent manufacturers. Our customers sell these systems to automotive original equipment manufacturers and diesel engine manufacturers. Sales within this segment may be affected by adverse developments in the global vehicle or U.S. freight haulingindustries or by such factors as higher fuel prices that may affect vehicle sales or downturns in freight traffic.  Sales in our Specialty Materialssegment track closely with the semiconductor cycle and our customers responses to that cycle. In 2008, one customer accounted for 11% of Specialty Materials segment sales.  Sales in our Life Sciences segment are through two large distributors, and the remaining balance is to a variety of government entities, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, hospitals, universities and otherresearch facilities. In 2008, our primary distributor accounted for 45% of Life Sciences segment sales. Changes in our distribution arrangements in this segment may adversely affect this segments financial results.  If the markets for our products do not develop and expand as we anticipate, demand for our products may decline, which would negatively impact our results ofoperations and financial performance  The markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies, evolving industry or governmentstandards and new product introductions. Our success is expected to depend, in substantial part, on the successful introduction of new products, or upgrades of current products, and our ability to compete with new technologies. The following factorsrelated to our products and markets, if not achieved, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations:     our ability to introduce leading products such as glass substrates for liquid crystal displays, optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment, andenvironmental substrate and filter products at competitive prices;   our ability to manufacture adequate quantities of increasingly larger glass substrates to satisfy our customers technical requirements and our contractualobligations;   continued strong demand for notebook computers and LCD monitors;   growth in purchases of LCD televisions to replace other technologies;   screen size of LCD televisions, which affects glass demand;   our ability to develop new products in response to government regulations and laws, particularly diesel filter products in the Environmental Technologies segment;and   growth of the fiber-to-the-premises build-out in North America and western Europe.  We face pricing pressures in each of our leading businesses that could adversely affect our financial performance  We face pricing pressure in each of our leading businesses as a result of intense competition, emerging new technologies, or over-capacity. While we will work toward reducing our costs to offset pricing pressures, we may not be able toachieve proportionate reductions in costs or to sustain our current rate of cost reduction We anticipate pricing pressures will continue into 2009 and beyond in all our businesses.   9 Table of ContentsWe face risks related to our international operations and sales  We have customers and significant operations, including manufacturing and sales, located outside the U.S. We have large manufacturing operations for liquid crystaldisplay glass substrates in Taiwan, Japan and Korea, including an equity investment in Samsung Corning Precision operating in South Korea that makes glass substrates for the Korean LCD market. All of our Display segment customers are located in theAsia-Pacific region. As a result of these and other international operations, we face a number of risks, including:     geographical concentration of our factories and operations;   periodic health epidemic concerns;   difficulty of managing global operations;   difficulty in protecting intellectual property or sensitive commercial and operations data or information technology systems generally;  tariffs, duties and other trade barriers including anti-dumping duties;   differing legal systems;   natural disasters;   potential power loss affecting glass production and equipment damage;   political and economic instability in foreign markets; and   foreign currency risk.  Any of these items couldcause our sales or profitability to be significantly reduced.  Additionally, a significant amount of the specialized manufacturing capacity for our DisplayTechnologies segment is concentrated in three overseas countries and it is reasonably possible that the use of one or more such facilities could be disrupted. Due to the specialized nature of the assets and the customers locations, it may notbe possible to find replacement capacity quickly or substitute production from facilities in other countries. Accordingly, loss of these facilities could produce a near-term severe impact to our display business and the Company as a whole. We face risks due to foreign currency fluctuations  Because we have significant customers and operations outside the U.S., fluctuations in foreign currencies, especially the Japanese yen, the New Taiwan dollar, the Korean won, and the euro, affect our sales and profit levels. Foreignexchange rates may make our products less competitive in countries where local currencies decline in value relative to the dollar and Japanese yen. Sales in our Display Technologies segment, representing 46% of Cornings sales in 2008, aredenominated in Japanese yen. If sales grow in our Display Technologies segment this will increase our exposure to currency fluctuations. Corning hedges significant transaction and balance sheet currency exposures and uses derivatives instruments tolimit exposure to foreign currency fluctuations associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities as well as operating results. Although we hedge these items, changes in exchange rates (especially the Japanese yen to U.S. dollar) maysignificantly impact our reported revenues and profits.  If the financial condition of our customers declines, our credit risks could increase Although we have a rigorous process to administer credit and believe our reserve is adequate, we have experienced, and in the future may experience,losses as a result of our inability to collect our accounts receivable. If our customers fail to meet their payment obligations to us, we could experience reduced cash flows and losses in excess of amounts reserved. Some customers of our DisplayTechnologies segment are thinly capitalized and/or marginally profitable. In our Environmental products segment, the U.S. auto makers and certain of their suppliers have encountered credit downgrades. These factors may result in an inability tocollect receivables or a possible loss in business. As of December 31, 2008 reserves and allowances for trade receivables totaled approximately $20 million.  If we do not successfully adjust our manufacturing volumes and fixed cost structure, or achieve manufacturing yields or sufficient product reliability, our operating results and cash flow could suffer, and we may not achieve anticipatedprofitability levels  Investments in additional manufacturing capacity of certain businesses, including liquid crystal display glass and dieselemission substrates and filters present challenges. We may face technical and process issues in moving to commercial production and there can be no assurance that Corning will be able to pace its capacity expansion to the actual demand. Economicresults may adversely affect our ability to complete planned capacity expansion and products. It is possible that manufacturing capacity may exceed or lag customer demand during certain periods.   10 Table of ContentsThe manufacturing of our products involves highly complex and precise processes, requiring production in highlycontrolled and dust-free environments. Changes in our manufacturing processes could significantly reduce our manufacturing yields and product reliability. In some cases, existing manufacturing may be insufficient to achieve the requirements of ourcustomers. We will need to develop new manufacturing processes and techniques to achieve targeted volume, pricing and cost levels that will permit profitable operations. While we continue to fund projects to improve our manufacturing techniques andprocesses, we may not achieve satisfactory cost levels in our manufacturing activities that will fully satisfy our profitability targets.  Our futurefinancial performance depends on our ability to purchase a sufficient amount of materials, parts, and manufacturing equipment components to meet the demands of our customers  Our ability to meet customer demand depends, in part, on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of materials, parts and components from our suppliers. We may experience shortages that could adverselyaffect our operations. Although we work closely with our suppliers to avoid shortages, there can be no assurances that we will not encounter these problems in the future. Furthermore, certain manufacturing equipment, raw materials or components areavailable only from a single source or limited sources. We may not be able to find alternate sources in a timely manner. A reduction, interruption or delay of supply, or a significant increase in the price for supplies, such as manufacturingequipment, raw materials or energy, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses.  We have incurred, and may in the future incur,restructuring and other charges, the amounts of which are difficult to predict accurately  We have recorded several charges for restructuring,impairment of assets, and the write-off of cost and equity based investments in the last 3 years. As a result of the decline in the economy and its impact on Cornings businesses, we recorded a restructuring charge of $22 million in theTelecommunications segment in 2008 and, in January announced our plans to reduce our global workforce which will cause a restructuring charge in the range of $115 million to $165 million in the first quarter of 2009. Certain of our equity affiliatesare also considering restructuring charges. We may have additional actions which result in restructuring charges in the future.  We have incurred, andmay in the future incur, goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges  At December 31, 2008, Corning had goodwill and other intangibleassets of $305 million. While we believe the estimates and judgments about future cash flows used in the goodwill impairment tests are reasonable, we cannot provide assurance that future impairment charges will not be required if the expected cashflow estimates as projected by management do not occur, especially if the current economic recession continues for a lengthy period or becomes more severe.  If our products, including materials purchased from our suppliers experience performance issues, our business will suffer  Our businessdepends on the production of products of consistently high quality. Our products, components and materials purchased from our suppliers, are typically tested for quality. These testing procedures are limited to evaluating our products under likelyand foreseeable failure scenarios. For various reasons, our products, including materials purchased from our suppliers, may fail to perform as expected. In some cases, product redesigns or additional expense may be required to correct a defect. Asignificant or systemic product failure could result in customer relations problems, lost sales, and financial damages.  We face competition in most ofour businesses  We expect that we will face additional competition from existing competitors, low cost manufacturers and new entrants. We must investin research and development, expand our engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities, and continue to improve customer service and support in order to remain competitive. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to maintain orimprove our competitive position.  Changes in our effective tax rate or tax liability may have an adverse effect on our results of operations Our effective tax rate could be adversely impacted by several factors, some of which are outside of our control, including:     changes in the relative amounts of income before taxes in the various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates;  changes in tax laws and the interpretation of those tax laws;   changes to our assessments about the realizability of our deferred tax assets which are based on estimates of our future results, the prudence and feasibility ofpossible tax planning strategies, and the economic environments in which we do business;   the outcome of current and future tax audits, examinations, or administrative appeals;   changes in generally accepted accounting principles that affect the accounting for taxes; and   limitations or adverse findings regarding our ability to do business in some jurisdictions.   11 Table of ContentsIn the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determinationis uncertain. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination could be materially different from our historical tax provisionsand accruals.  Accounting and disclosure rules may affect financial results  Generally accepted accounting principles and accompanying accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations for many areas of our business, such as revenue recognition, accounting forinvestments, and accounting for stock options, are very complex and involve significant and sometimes subjective judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation could significantly impact our reported earnings and operating income andcould add significant volatility to those measures in the future, without a corresponding change in our cash flows.  We rely on key personnel and theloss of their services or the inability to attract and retain them may negatively affect our businesses  Our ability to continue to attract, retain andmotivate qualified research and development, engineering and operating personnel, generally and during periods of rapid growth, especially in those of our businesses focused on new products and advanced manufacturing processes, is essential to ourbusiness success. We also depend on the services of experienced key senior management.  The loss of the services of any of our key research anddevelopment, engineering or operational personnel or senior management without adequate replacement, or the inability to attract new qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial performance.

Any failure on our part tocomply with any present or future environmental regulations could result in the assessment of damages or imposition of fines against us, suspension/cessation of production or operations. In addition, environmental regulations could require us toacquire costly equipment, incur other significant compliance expenses or limit or restrict production or operations and thus materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.  Changes in regulations and the regulatory environment in the U.S. and other countries, such as those resultingfrom the regulation and impact of global warming and CO2 abatement, may affect our businesses and their results in adverse ways by, among otherthings, substantially increasing manufacturing costs, limiting availability of scarce resources, especially energy, or requiring limitations on production and sale of our products or those of our customers.

  Set forth below are some of the principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our actualbusiness results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements contained in this Report or otherwise have a detrimental affect on the company. These risks should be considered in making any investment decisions in Corning. Future resultscould be materially affected by general industry and market conditions, changes in laws or accounting rules, general economic and political conditions, including a global economic slowdown, fluctuation of interest rates or currency exchange rates,terrorism, political unrest or international conflicts, political instability or major health concerns, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected business conditions. These risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionarycomments concerning forward-looking statements in this Annual Report. Additional risks not described above, or unknown to us, may also adversely affect Corning or its results.  Our sales could be negatively impacted if one or more of our key customers substantially reduce orders for our products  Cornings ten largest customers account for about 50% of our sales. No individual customer accounts for more than 10% of consolidated sales except for AU Optronics Corporation (AUO) which accounted for 12% ofconsolidated sales in 2007.  In addition, a relatively small number of customers accounted for a high percentage of net sales in each ofour reportable operating segments. For 2007, three customers of the Display Technologies segment, which individually accounted for more than 10% of segment net sales, represented 62% of total segment sales when combined. In the Telecommunicationssegment, two customers, which individually accounted for more than 10% of segment net sales, represented 25% of total segment sales when combined. In the Environmental Technologies segment, three customers, which individually accounted for more than10% of segment net sales, represented 81% of total segment sales in aggregate. In the Life Sciences segment, one distributor accounted for 44% of this segments sales in 2007.  Samsung Corning Precisions sales were also concentrated in 2007, with sales to two LCD panel makers located in South Korea accounting forapproximately 93% of total Samsung Corning Precision sales.  Although the sale of LCD glass substrates has increased in 2007, there can beno assurance that positive trends will continue. Our customers are LCD panel and color filter makers. As they switch to larger size glass, the pace of their orders may be uneven while they adjust their manufacturing processes and facilities.Additionally, consumer preferences for panels of differing sizes, price, or other seasonal factors, may lead to pauses in market growth from time to time. Our customers may not be able to maintain profitable operations or access sufficient capitalto fund ongoing and future planned expansions, which may limit their pace of orders to us. Emerging material technologies could replace our glass substrates for certain applications resulting in a decline in demand for our LCD products. Technologiesfor displays in competition with LCD panels may reduce or eliminate the need for our glass substrate. These technologies may include organic light emitting diodes and plasma display panels. New process technologies developed by our competitors mayalso place us at a cost or quality disadvantage in the workplace. Our inability to manufacture glass substrates in the sizes and quantities needed by our customers may result in loss of revenue, margins and profits or liabilities for failure tosupply. A scarcity of resources, limitations on technology, personnel or other factors resulting in a failure to produce commercial quantities of very large size glass substrates, particularly from new facilities being constructed at a majorcustomer in Japan, could have adverse financial consequences to us.  Our Telecommunications segment customers purchases of ourproducts are affected by their capital expansion plans, general market and economic uncertainty and regulatory changes, including broadband policy. Sales in the Telecommunications segment are expected to be impacted by the pace of VerizonCommunication Inc. (Verizon) fiber-to-the-premises deployments. Our sales will be dependent on Verizons planned targets for homes passed and connected. Changes in Verizons deployment plan could adversely affect future sales in anyquarter or for the full year.   9 In the Environmental Technologies segment, sales of our ceramic substrate and filter products forautomotive and diesel emissions and pollution control are expected to fluctuate with vehicle production. Changes in governmental laws and regulations for air quality and emission controls may also influence future sales. Sales in our EnvironmentalTechnologies segment are to four catalyzers and emission system component manufacturers. Our customers sell these systems to automotive original equipment manufacturers and diesel engine manufacturers. Sales within this segment may be affected byadverse developments in the U.S. vehicle or freight hauling industries or by such factors as higher fuel prices that may affect vehicle sales or downturns in freight traffic.  Sales in our Life Sciences segment were historically through two large distributors to government entities, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies,hospitals, universities and other research facilities. During 2005, we did not renew the contract with one large distributor and transitioned the sales through this distributor to our remaining primary distributor and other existing and developingchannels. This change had an adverse impact on sales volumes. In 2007, our remaining primary distributor accounted for 44% of Life Sciences segment sales. Changes in our distribution arrangements in this segment may adversely affect thissegments financial results.  If the markets for our products do not develop and expand as we anticipate, demand for our products may decline,which would negatively impact our results of operations and financial performance  The markets for our products are characterized byrapidly changing technologies, evolving industry or government standards and new product introductions. Our success is expected to depend, in substantial part, on the successful introduction of new products, or upgrades of current products, and ourability to compete with new technologies. The following factors related to our products and markets, if not achieved, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations:      our ability to introduce leading products such as glass substrates for liquid crystal displays, optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment, andenvironmental substrate and filter products that can command competitive prices;    our ability to manufacture adequate quantities of increasingly larger glass substrates to satisfy our customers requirements and our contractual obligations;   continued strong demand for notebook computers and LCD monitors;    growth in purchases of LCD televisions to replace other technologies;    screen size of LCD televisions, which affects glass demand;    our ability to develop new products in response to government regulations and laws, particularly diesel filter products in the Environmental Technologies segment;and    growth of the fiber-to-the-premises build-out in North America.  We face pricing pressures in each of our leading businesses that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial performance  We face pricing pressure in each of our leading businesses as a result of intense competition, emerging new technologies, or over-capacity. While we willwork toward reducing our costs to offset pricing pressures, we may not be able to achieve proportionate reductions in costs or to sustain our current rate of cost reduction We anticipate pricing pressures will continue into 2008 and beyond on anumber of our products. Although we have reduced the rate of price decline in 2007 in our Display Technologies segment and plan to continue to do so in 2008, we cannot be assured of success. Our 2008 pricing strategy in our Display Technologiessegment may also result in lost market share and lower volumes.   10 We face risks related to our international operations and sales  We have customers and significant operations, including manufacturing and sales, located outside the U.S. We have large manufacturing operations forliquid crystal display glass substrates in Taiwan and the Asia-Pacific region, including an equity investment in Samsung Corning Precision operating in South Korea that makes glass substrates for the LCD market. All of our Display segment customersare located in the Asia-Pacific region. As a result of these and other international operations, we face a number of risks, including:      geographical concentration of our factories and operations;    periodic health epidemic concerns;    difficulty of managing global operations;    difficulty in protecting intellectual property;    tariffs, duties and other trade barriers including anti-dumping duties;    differing legal systems;    natural disasters;    potential power loss affecting glass production and equipment damage;    political and economic instability in foreign markets; and    foreign currency risk.  Any of theseitems could cause our sales or profitability to be significantly reduced.  Additionally, because a significant amount of the specializedmanufacturing capacity for our Display Technologies segment is concentrated in Asia, it is at least reasonably possible that the use of a facility located outside of an entitys home country could be disrupted. Due to the specialized nature ofthe assets, it would not be possible to find replacement capacity quickly. Accordingly, loss of these facilities could produce a near-term severe impact to our display business and the Company as a whole.  We face risks due to foreign currency fluctuations  Because we have significant customers and operations outside the U.S., fluctuations in foreign currencies, especially the Japanese yen, the New Taiwan dollar, the Korean won, and the euro, affect our sales and profit levels. Foreignexchange rates may make our products less competitive in countries where local currencies decline in value relative to the dollar and Japanese yen. Sales in our Display Technologies segment, representing 45% of Cornings sales in 2007, aredenominated in Japanese yen. The expected sales growth of the Display Technologies segment will increase our exposure to currency fluctuations. Corning hedges significant transaction and balance sheet currency exposures and uses derivativesinstruments to limit exposure to foreign currency fluctuations associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities as well as operating results. Although we hedge these items, changes in exchange rates (especially the Japanese yen to U.S.dollar) may significantly impact our reported revenues and results of operations.  If the financial condition of our customers declines, our creditrisks could increase  Although we have a rigorous process to administer credit and believe our reserve is adequate, we haveexperienced, and in the future may experience, losses as a result of our inability to collect our accounts receivable. If our customers fail to meet their payment obligations to us, we could experience reduced cash flows and losses in excess ofamounts reserved. Some customers of our Display Technologies segment are thinly capitalized and/or marginally profitable. In our Environmental products segment, the U.S. auto customers and certain of their suppliers have encountered creditdowngrades. These factors may result in an inability to collect receivables or a possible loss in business. As of December 31, 2007, reserves and allowances for trade receivables totaled approximately $20 million.  If we do not successfully adjust our manufacturing volumes and fixed cost structure, or achieve manufacturing yields or sufficient product reliability, our operatingresults could suffer, and we may not achieve anticipated profitability levels  We are investing heavily in additional manufacturingcapacity of certain businesses, including liquid crystal display glass and diesel emission substrates and filters. The speed of constructing the new facilities presents challenges. We may face technical and process issues in moving to commercialproduction. There can be no assurance that Corning will be able to pace its capacity expansion to the actual demand. It is possible that manufacturing capacity may exceed or lag customer demand during certain periods.  The manufacturing of our products involves highly complex and precise processes, requiring production in highly controlled and dust-free environments.Changes in our manufacturing processes could significantly reduce our manufacturing yields and product reliability. In some cases, existing manufacturing may be insufficient to achieve the requirements of our customers. We will need to develop newmanufacturing processes and techniques to achieve targeted volume, pricing and cost levels that will permit profitable operations. While we continue to fund projects to improve our manufacturing techniques and processes, we may not achievesatisfactory cost levels in our manufacturing activities that will fully satisfy our profitability targets.   11 Our future operating results depend on our ability to purchase a sufficient amount of materials, parts, andmanufacturing equipment components to meet the demands of our customers  Our ability to meet customer demand depends, in part, on ourability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of materials, parts and components from our suppliers. We may experience shortages that could adversely affect our operations. Although we work closely with our suppliers to avoid shortages, there canbe no assurances that we will not encounter these problems in the future. Furthermore, certain manufacturing equipment, raw materials or components are available only from a single source or limited sources. We may not be able to find alternatesources in a timely manner. A reduction, interruption or delay of supply, or a significant increase in the price for supplies, such as manufacturing equipment, raw materials or energy, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses. We have incurred, and may in the future incur, restructuring and other charges, the amounts of which are difficult to predict accurately We have recorded several charges for restructuring, impairment of assets, and the write-off of cost and equity based investments. Itis possible we may record additional charges for restructuring or other asset impairments if additional actions become necessary.  We have incurred, andmay in the future incur, goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges  At December 31, 2007, Corning had goodwill andother intangible assets of $308 million. While we believe the estimates and judgments about future cash flows used in the goodwill impairment tests are reasonable, we cannot provide assurance that future impairment charges will not be required ifthe expected cash flow estimates as projected by management do not occur.  If our products or materials purchased from our suppliers experienceperformance issues, our business will suffer  Our business depends on the production of products of consistently high quality. Ourproducts, components and materials purchased from our suppliers, are typically tested for quality. These testing procedures are limited to evaluating our products under likely and foreseeable failure scenarios. For various reasons, our products,including materials purchased from our suppliers, may fail to perform as expected. In some cases, product redesigns or additional expense may be required to correct a defect. A significant or systemic product failure could result in customerrelations problems, lost sales, and financial damages.  We face competition in most of our businesses  We expect that we will face additional competition from existing competitors, low cost manufacturers and new entrants. We must invest in research anddevelopment, expand our engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities, and continue to improve customer service and support in order to remain competitive. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to maintain or improve ourcompetitive position.  Accounting and disclosure rules may affect financial results  Generally accepted accounting principles and accompanying accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines, and interpretations for many areas of ourbusiness, such as revenue recognition, accounting for investments, and accounting for stock options, are very complex and involve significant and sometimes subjective judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation could significantlyimpact our reported earnings and operating income and could add significant volatility to those measures in the future, without a corresponding change in our cash flows.  We rely on key personnel and the loss of their services or the inability to attract and retain them may negatively affect our businesses  Our ability to continue to attract, retain and motivate qualified research and development, engineering and operating personnel, generally and duringperiods of rapid growth, especially in those of our businesses focused on new products and advanced manufacturing processes, is essential to our business success. We also depend on the services of experienced key senior management.  The loss of the services of any of our key research and development, engineering or operational personnel or senior management without adequatereplacement, or the inability to attract new qualified personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our operations.   12 We are subject to strict environmental regulations and regulatory changes that could result in fines or restrictionsthat interrupt our operations  Our manufacturing process generates chemical waste, waste water and other industrial waste and variousgreen house gases at various stages in the manufacturing process, and we are currently or may be in the future subject to a variety of laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of such substances. We have installedvarious types of anti-pollution equipment for the treatment of chemical waste and waste water at our various facilities. However, we cannot provide assurance that environmental claims will not be brought against us or that the local or nationalgovernments will not take steps toward adopting more stringent environment standards.  Any failure on our part to comply with any presentor future environmental regulations could result in the assessment of damages or imposition of fines against us, suspension/cessation of production or operations. In addition, environmental regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment,incur other significant compliance expenses or limit or restrict production or operations and thus materially and negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations.  Changes in regulations and the regulatory environment in the United States and other countries,such as those resulting from the regulation and impact of global warming and CO2 abatement, may affect our businesses and their results in adverse ways by,among other things, substantially increasing manufacturing costs, limiting availability of scarce resources, especially energy, or requiring limitations on production and sale of our products or those of our customers.  We may experience difficulties in enforcing our intellectual property rights and we may be subject to claims of infringement of the intellectual property rights ofothers  We may encounter difficulties in protecting our intellectual property rights or obtaining rights to additional intellectualproperty necessary to permit us to continue or expand our businesses. We cannot assure you that the patents that we hold or may obtain will provide meaningful protection against our competitors. Changes in law concerning intellectual property mayaffect our ability to protect our intellectual property. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights. Litigation is inherently uncertain and the outcome is often unpredictable. Other companies hold patents on technologiesused in our industries and are aggressively seeking to expand, enforce and license their patent portfolios.  The intellectual propertyrights of others could inhibit our ability to introduce new products. We are, and may in the future be, subject to claims of intellectual property infringement or misappropriation that may result in loss of revenue, require us to incur substantialcosts, or lead to monetary damages or injunctive relief against us. We cannot assure you as to the outcome of any such claims.  Current or futurelitigation may harm our financial condition or results of operations  Pending, threatened or future litigation is subject to inherentuncertainties. Our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected by unfavorable outcomes, expenses and costs exceeding amounts estimated or insured. In particular, we have been named as a defendant in numerous lawsuitsalleging personal injury from exposure to asbestos. As described in Legal Proceedings, our negotiations with the representatives of asbestos claimants produced a tentative plan of settlement through a PCC Plan of Reorganization, but this Plan wasnot confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court. The proponents of the Plan have moved for reconsideration of the order entered by the Court on December 21, 2006 denying Plan confirmation. It is reasonably possible that changes to the Plan will benegotiated, but the elements of the Plan and final approval are subject to a number of contingencies. Total charges of $1 billion have been recorded through December 31, 2007; however, additional charges or credits are possible due to thepotential fluctuation in the price of our common stock, other adjustments in the proposed settlement, and other litigation factors.  We face risksthrough our equity method investments in companies that we do not control  Cornings net income includes significant equity inearnings of associated companies. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we recognized $942 million of equity earnings, of which $927 million came from our two largest investments: Dow Corning Corporation (which makes silicone products) andSamsung Corning Precision (which makes liquid crystal display glass). Samsung Corning Precision is located in the Asia-Pacific region and is subject to political and geographic risks mentioned above, as well as business and other risks within theDisplay segment. Our equity investments may not continue to perform at the same levels as in recent years. In 2006 and 2007, we recognized equity losses associated with Samsung Corning Co., Ltd. (our 50% equity method investment that makes glasspanels and funnels for conventional televisions), which recorded fixed asset and other impairment charges.   13 We may not have adequate insurance coverage for claims against us  We face the risk of loss resulting from product liability, securities, fiduciary liability, intellectual property, antitrust, contractual, warranty,environmental, fraud and other lawsuits, whether or not such claims are valid. In addition, our product liability, fiduciary, directors and officers, property, natural catastrophe and comprehensive general liability insurance may not be adequate tocover such claims or may not be available to the extent we expect. Our insurance costs can be volatile and, at any time, can increase given changes in market supply and demand. We may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage in the futureat acceptable costs. A successful claim that exceeds or is not covered by our policies could require us to pay substantial sums. Some of the carriers in our excess insurance programs are in liquidation and may not be able to respond if we shouldhave claims reaching into excess layers. The financial health of other insurers may deteriorate. Several of our insurance carriers are litigating with us the extent, if any, of their obligation to provide insurance coverage for asbestosisliabilities asserted against us. The results of that litigation may adversely affect our insurance coverage for those risks. In addition, we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage for certain risk such as political risk, terrorism orwar.   14 Other  Additional information in response to Item 1 is found in Note 18 (Operating Segments) to the consolidated financial statements and selected financial data"
17,GLW,CORNING INC,2007-02-27,"Risk Factors
Set forth below are some of the principal risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual business results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements contained in this Report. Future results could be materially affected by general industry and market conditions, changes in laws or accounting rules, general economic and political conditions, including a global economic slowdown, fluctuation of interest rates or currency exchange rates, terrorism, political unrest or international conflicts, political instability or major health concerns, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected business conditions. These risk factors should be considered in addition to our cautionary comments concerning forward-looking statements in this Annual Report.10Our sales could be negatively impacted if one or more of our key customers substantially reduce orders for our products      Cornings ten largest customers account for about 50% of our sales. No individual customer accounts for more than 10% of consolidated sales except for AU Optronics Corporation (AUO) which accounted for 13% of consolidated sales in 2006.     In addition, a relatively small number of customers accounted for a high percentage of net sales in each of our reportable operating segments. For 2006, three customers of the Display Technologies segment, which individually accounted for more than 10% of segment net sales, represented 64% of total segment sales when combined. In the Telecommunications segment, two customers, which individually accounted for more than 10% of segment net sales, represented 25% of total segment sales when combined. In the Environmental Technologies segment, three customers, which individually accounted for more than 10% of segment net sales, represented 72% of total segment sales in aggregate. In the Life Sciences segment, one distributor accounted for 43% of this segments sales in 2006.     Samsung Corning Precisions sales were also concentrated in 2006, with sales to two LCD panel makers located in South Korea accounting for approximately 92% of total Samsung Corning Precision sales.     Although the sale of LCD glass substrates has increased in 2006, there can be no assurance that positive trends will continue. Our customers are LCD panel and color filter makers. As they switch to larger size glass, the pace of their orders may be uneven while they adjust their manufacturing processes and facilities. Additionally, consumer preferences for panels of differing sizes, price, or other seasonal factors, may lead to pauses in market growth from time to time. Our customers may not be able to maintain profitable operations or access sufficient capital to fund ongoing and future planned expansions, which may limit their pace of orders to us. Emerging technologies could replace our glass substrates for certain applications resulting in a decline in demand for our LCD products.     Our Telecommunications segment customers purchases of our products are affected by their capital expansion plans, general market and economic uncertainty and regulatory changes, including broadband policy. Sales in the Telecommunications segment are expected to be impacted by the pace of Verizon Communication Inc. (Verizon) fiber-to-the-premises deployments. Our sales will be dependent on Verizons planned targets for homes passed and connected. Changes in Verizons deployment plan could adversely affect future sales in any quarter or for the full year.     In the Environmental Technologies segment, sales of our ceramic substrate and filter products for automotive and diesel emissions and pollution control are expected to fluctuate with vehicle production. Changes in governmental laws and regulations for air quality and emission controls may also influence future sales. Sales in our Environmental Technologies segment are to four catalyzers and emission system component manufacturers. Our customers sell these systems to automotive original equipment manufacturers and diesel engine manufacturers. Sales within this segment may be affected by adverse developments in the U.S. auto industry or by such factors as higher fuel prices that may affect vehicles sales.     Sales in our Life Sciences segment were historically through two large distributors to government entities, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, hospitals, universities and other research facilities. During 2005, we did not renew the contract with one large distributor and transitioned the sales through this distributor to our remaining primary distributor and other existing and developing channels. This change had an adverse impact on sales volumes. In 2006, our remaining primary distributor accounted for 43% of Life Sciences segment sales.11If the markets for our products do not develop and expand as we anticipate, demand for our products may decline, which would negatively impact our results of operations and financial performance      The markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies, evolving industry or government standards and new product introductions. Our success is expected to depend, in substantial part, on the successful introduction of new products, or upgrades of current products, and our ability to compete with new technologies. The following factors related to our products and markets, if not achieved, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations:our ability to introduce leading products such as glass substrates for liquid crystal displays, optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment, and environmental substrate products that can command competitive prices;our ability to achieve a favorable sales mix of large generation sizes of liquid crystal display glass;our ability to develop new products in response to government regulations and laws, particularly diesel filter products in the Environmental Technologies segment;continued strong demand for notebook computers and LCD monitors;growth in purchases of LCD televisions to replace other technologies;screen size of LCD televisions, which affects glass demands; andgrowth of the fiber-to-the-premises build-out in North America.We face pricing pressures in each of our leading businesses that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial performance      We face pricing pressure in each of our leading businesses as a result of intense competition, emerging new technologies, or over-capacity. While we will work toward reducing our costs to offset pricing pressures, we may not be able to achieve proportionate reductions in costs. As a result of overcapacity in the Telecommunications segment, we anticipate pricing pressures will continue into 2007 and beyond. Pricing pressure in our Display Technologies segment was at a historically high level in 2006. Although we are taking steps to reduce the rate of price decline in 2007, we cannot be assured of success. Our 2007 pricing strategy may also result in lost market share.We face risks related to our international operations and sales      We have customers and significant operations, including manufacturing and sales, located outside the U.S. We have large manufacturing operations for liquid crystal display glass substrates in Taiwan and the Asia-Pacific region, including an equity investment in Samsung Corning Precision operating in South Korea that makes glass substrates for the LCD market. All of our Display segment customers are located in the Asia-Pacific region. As a result of these and other international operations, we face a number of risks, including:geographical concentration of our factories and operations;periodic health concerns;difficulty of managing global operations;difficulty in protecting intellectual property;tariffs, duties and other trade barriers including anti-dumping duties;undeveloped legal systems;natural disasters;potential power loss affecting glass production and equipment damage;political and economic instability in foreign markets, andforeign currency risk.     Any of these items could cause our sales or profitability to be significantly reduced.12We face risks due to foreign currency fluctuations     Because we have significant customers and operations outside the U.S., fluctuations in foreign currencies, especially the Japanese yen, the New Taiwan dollar, the Korean won, and the euro, affect our sales and profit levels. Foreign exchange rates may make our products less competitive in countries where local currencies decline in value relative to the dollar and Japanese yen. Sales in our Display Technologies segment, representing 41% of Cornings sales, are denominated in Japanese yen. The expected sales growth of the Display Technologies segment will increase our exposure to currency fluctuations. Although we hedge significant transaction and balance sheet currency exposures, we do not hedge translation risk and thus changes in exchange rates (especially the yen) may significantly impact our reported revenues and results of operations.If the financial condition of our customers declines, our credit risks could increase      Although we have a rigorous process to administer credit and believe our reserve is adequate, we have experienced, and in the future may experience, losses as a result of our inability to collect our accounts receivable. If our customers fail to meet their payment obligations to us, we could experience reduced cash flows and losses in excess of amounts reserved. Some customers of our Display Technologies segment are thinly capitalized and/ or marginally profitable. In our Environmental products segment, the U.S. auto customers and certain of their suppliers have encountered credit downgrades or, in the case of Delphi Corporation, bankruptcy. These factors may result in an inability to collect receivables or a possible loss in business. As of December 31, 2006, reserves for trade receivables totaled approximately $21 million.If we do not successfully adjust our manufacturing volumes and fixed cost structure, or achieve manufacturing yields or sufficient product reliability, our operating results could suffer, and we may not achieve anticipated profitability levels     We are investing heavily in additional manufacturing capacity of certain businesses, including liquid crystal display glass and diesel emission substrates and filters. The speed of constructing the new facilities presents challenges. We may face technical and process issues in moving to commercial production. There can be no assurance that Corning will be able to pace its capacity expansion to the actual demand. It is possible that manufacturing capacity may exceed customer demand during certain periods.     The manufacturing of our products involves highly complex and precise processes, requiring production in highly controlled and dust-free environments.

We may experience shortages that could adversely affect our operations. Although we work closely with our suppliers to avoid shortages, there can be no assurances that we will not encounter these problems in the future. Furthermore, certain manufacturing equipment or components are available only from a single source or limited sources. We may not be able to find alternate sources in a timely manner. A reduction or interruption in supplies, or a significant increase in the price of supplies, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses.13We have incurred, and may in the future incur, restructuring and other charges, the amounts of which are difficult to predict accurately      We have recorded several charges for restructuring, impairment of assets, and the write-off of cost and equity based investments. It is possible we may record additional charges for restructuring or other asset impairments if additional actions become necessary.We have incurred, and may in the future incur, goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges      At December 31, 2006, Corning had goodwill and other intangible assets of $316 million. While we believe the estimates and judgments about future cash flows used in the goodwill impairment tests are reasonable, we cannot provide assurance that future impairment charges will not be required if the expected cash flow estimates as projected by management do not occur.If our products or materials purchased from our suppliers experience performance issues, our business will suffer      Our business depends on the production of products of consistently high quality.

Total charges of $816 million have beenrecorded through December 31, 2006; however, additional charges or credits are possible due to the potential fluctuation in the price of our common stock, other adjustments in the proposed settlement, and other litigation factors.14We face risks through our equity method investments in companies that we do not control      Cornings net income includes significant equity in earnings of associated companies. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we recognized $960 million of equity earnings, of which $889 million came from our two largest investments: Dow Corning Corporation (which makes silicone products) and Samsung Corning Precision (which makes liquid crystal display glass). Samsung Corning Precision is located in the Asia-Pacific region and is subject to political and geographic risks mentioned above, as well as business and other risks within the Display segment. Our equity investments may not continue to perform at the same levels as in recent years. In 2005 and 2006, we recognized equity losses associated with Samsung Corning Co., Ltd. (our 50% equity method investment that makes glass panels and funnels for conventional televisions), which recorded fixed asset and other impairment charges. As the conventional television market will benegatively impacted by strong growth in the LCD glass market, it is reasonably possible that Samsung Corning Co., Ltd. may incur additional restructuring or impairment charges or net operating losses in the future.We may not have adequate insurance coverage for claims against us      We face the risk of loss resulting from product liability, securities, fiduciary liability, intellectual property, antitrust, contractual, warranty, fraud and other lawsuits, whether or not such claims are valid. In addition, our product liability, fiduciary, directors and officers, property, natural catastrophe and comprehensive general liability insurance may not be adequate to cover such claims or may not be available to the extent we expect.
