7,BELFB,BEL FUSE INC,2024-03-11,"  Risk Factors
 The risks described below should be carefully considered before making an investment decision. These are the risk factors that we consider to be material, but they are not the only risk factors that should be considered in making an investment decision. This Form 10-K also contains Forward-Looking Statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See the ""Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Information,"" above. Our business, consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of the risk factors described below, under ""Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Information"" or with respect to specific Forward-Looking Statements presented herein. The trading price of our securities could decline due to any of these risks, and investors in our securities may lose all or part of their investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business in the future.  Except as required by the federal securities law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any risk factor, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. STRATEGIC RISKS We conduct business in a highly competitive industry. Our business operates in a globally competitive industry, with relatively low barriers to entry. We compete principally on the basis of product performance, quality, reliability, depth of product line, customer service, technological innovation, design, delivery time and price. The industry in which we operate has become increasingly concentrated and globalized in recent years and our major competitors, many of which are larger than Bel, have significant financial resources and technological capabilities. Our intellectual property rights may not be adequately protected under the current state of the law. Our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights through patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and in other countries may not prevent misappropriation, and our failure or inability to protect our proprietary rights could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and future prospects. A third party could, without authorization, copy or otherwise appropriate our proprietary information. Our agreements with employees and others who participate in development activities could be breached, we may not have adequate remedies for any breach, and our trade secrets may otherwise become known or independently developed by competitors. Our acquisitions may not produce the anticipated results. A significant portion of our growth has been attributable to acquisitions. We cannot assure that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future. If an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our other businesses, our results of operations, enterprise value, market value and prospects could all be materially and adversely affected. Integration of new acquisitions into our consolidated operations may result in lower average operating results for the group as a whole, and may divert management's focus from the ongoing operations of the Company during the integration period. Our strategy also focuses on the reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses through the integration or elimination of redundant sales facilities and administrative functions at acquired companies. If we are unable to achieve our expectations with respect to our acquisitions, such inability could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations. If the acquisitions fail to perform up to our expectations, or if there is a weakening of economic conditions, we could be required to record impairment charges on the goodwill associated with our acquisitions.  We are dependent on our ability to develop new products. Our future operating results are dependent, in part, on our ability to develop, produce and market new and more technologically advanced products. There are numerous risks inherent in this process, including the risks that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to timely develop and bring to market new products and applications to meet customers' changing needs.        11     Table of Contents OPERATIONAL RISKS Our global operations and demand for our products face risks related to health epidemics such as the coronavirus.  Any outbreaks of contagious diseases and other adverse public health developments in countries where we operate could have a material and adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations. Over the past three years, our business was impacted by temporary facility closures, shelter-in-place orders and challenges related to travel restrictions imposed by the local governmental authorities as a result of COVID. Our suppliers, customers and our customers’ contract manufacturers have experienced similar challenges from time to time throughout the pandemic. As the status of the COVID pandemic and its effects continue to evolve, additional Bel facilities could become negatively impacted. COVID remains a potential supply continuity risk due to the unknown nature of future outbreaks including as a result of the emergence of further COVID virus variants. The extent to which COVID will impact our business and our consolidated financial results will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at the time of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  See ""Overview - Key Factors Affecting our Business - Potential Future Impacts of COVID"" in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of current and potential future impacts of COVID upon our business. We may experience labor unrest. As we periodically implement transfers of certain of our operations, we may experience strikes or other types of labor unrest as a result of lay-offs or termination of employees in higher labor cost countries. Our manufacturing facilities in the United Kingdom and Mexico are represented by labor unions and substantially all of our factory workers in the PRC are represented by government-sponsored unions. We may experience labor shortages. Government, economic, social and labor policies in the PRC may cause shortages of factory labor in areas where we have some of our products manufactured. Further, availability of labor in the PRC is cyclical and is significantly affected by the migration of workers in relation to the annual Lunar New Year holiday. If we are required to manufacture more of these products outside of the PRC as a result of such shortages, our margins will likely be materially adversely affected. A shortage of availability or an increase in the cost of raw materials, components and other resources may adversely impact our ability to procure these items at cost effective prices and thus may negatively impact profit margins. Additionally, inflationary pressures could result in higher input costs and materially adversely affect our financial results. Our results of operations may be materially adversely impacted by difficulties in obtaining raw materials, supplies, power, labor, natural resources and any other items needed for the production of our products, as well as by the effects of quality deviations in raw materials and the effects of significant fluctuations in the prices of existing inventories and purchase commitments for these materials. Many of these materials and components are produced by a limited number of suppliers and their availability to us may be constrained by supplier capacity. Any material disruption could materially adversely affect our financial results. In addition, inflationary pressures could result in higher input costs, including those related to our raw materials, labor, freight, utilities, healthcare and other expenses. Our future operating results will depend, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings initiatives and sourcing decisions, and any negative impact of inflation could materially adversely affect our financial results. See “Overview - Key Factors Affecting our Business"" in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of how pricing and availability of materials is currently impacting our business.        12     Table of Contents We have substantial manufacturing operations located in the PRC, which exposes us to significant risks that could materially and adversely affect our business, operations, consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations. The majority of Bel's Magnetic Solutions manufacturing capacity and supplier base is located in the PRC, as is a portion of Bel's Power Solutions and Protection group. As of December 31, 2023, 50% of our associates, 74% of our owned or leased manufacturing facilities (by square footage) and 24% of our Company’s tangible assets were all located in the PRC. Our Company’s presence and operations in the PRC expose us to significant risks that could materially and adversely affect our Company and our business, operations, financial position and results of operations. For example, our significant operational presence in the PRC exposes us to foreign currency exchange risk. Our PRC-based manufacturing associates’ salaries, and other labor and overhead costs, associated with our PRC operations are paid in the Chinese renminbi. As a result, the cost of our operations and our consolidated operating results may be adversely impacted by the effects of fluctuations in the applicable exchange rate for the renminbi as compared to the U.S dollar. Our significant labor force based within the PRC subjects us to risks associated with staffing and managing this substantial complement of factory workers and other associates who are important to our Company’s operations and success. As noted above, factory workers in the PRC are represented by government-sponsored unions, and are participants in a cyclical labor market that may become subject to shortages including as a result of PRC government policies. See “We may experience labor unrest” and “We may experience labor shortages” above. Wage rates in the PRC have been increasing in recent years as PRC government-mandated increases in the minimum wage rate have caused an increase in our overall pay scale for our PRC workers.  The PRC government has broad authority and discretion to regulate the economy, manufacturing, industry, and the technology sector, among other areas generally. As a result, our activities and operations in the PRC as well as those of our PRC-based suppliers are subject to extensive local government regulation. Additionally, the PRC government has implemented policies from time to time to regulate economic expansion. It exercises significant control over its economic growth through the allocation of resources, setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies. Any additional new regulations or the amendment of previously implemented regulations could require us to change our business plans, increase our costs, or limit our ability to manufacture and sell products domestically and/or otherwise restrict or curtail our operations in the PRC. To the extent our suppliers in the PRC are negatively impacted by new or amended regulations, any such negative implications could adversely impact our supply chain, including in the form of increased costs, disruptions, shortages or unavailability of product or component parts, and/or other deleterious consequences, which could materially adversely affect our business and operating results.         13     Table of Contents Our significant manufacturing operations in the PRC may expose us to other risks. Risks inherent in our PRC operations include the following:   ●  changes in import, export, transportation regulations and tariffs, and risks associated with boycotts and embargoes;   ●  changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements or restrictions, including tax and trade laws in the U.S. and in the PRC, and government action to restrict our ability to sell to customers where sales of products may require export licenses;   ●  transportation delays and other supply chain issues;   ●  changes in tax regulations in the U.S. and/or the PRC, including restrictions and/or taxes applicable to the transfer or repatriation of funds;   ●  international political relationships, including the relationship between the U.S. and the PRC;   ●  epidemics and illnesses (including COVID, any new variants that may emerge, and any future health crises) within the PRC that affect the areas in which we operate and manufacture our products;   ●  economic, social and political instability;   ●  longer accounts receivable collection cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable;   ●  less effective protection of intellectual property and contractual arrangements, and risks associated with enforcing contracts and legal rights and remedies generally;   ●  uncertainties associated with the PRC legal system, which is based on civil law, can involve protected proceedings involving substantial judicial discretion, and is based in part on PRC government policies and internal rules, some of which are not published on a timely basis, or at all, and may have retroactive effect;   ●  risks arising out of any changes in governmental and economic policy and the potential for adverse developments arising out of any political or economic instability related to Hong Kong or Taiwan;   ●  the potential for political unrest, expropriation, nationalization, revolution, war or acts of terrorism; and   ●  risks associated with the concentration of a substantial portion of our manufacturing capacity and supplier base in the PRC.  In addition to the risks associated with our PRC operations described above, the global nature of our operations generally subjects us to additional risks. We conduct operations in 14 countries, and outside of the United States (and the PRC), our largest manufacturing operations and associate populations are located within Mexico, Slovakia, the Dominican Republic, India and the United Kingdom. Please see the Risk Factor appearing below under the caption, ""The global nature of our operations exposes us to numerous risks that could materially adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations.” The loss of certain substantial customers could materially and adversely affect us. During the year ended December 31, 2023, while there were no direct customers whose sales exceeded 10% of our 2023 consolidated net sales, approximately11.6% of the Company's total net sales were sold to one ultimate end-user through various intermediary contract manufacturers. While Bel sells a diversified portfolio of products to this ultimate end-user, we believe that the loss of this end user could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. We have experienced significant concentrations of customers in prior years. See Note 14, ""Segments"" for additional disclosures related to our significant customers. Furthermore, factors that negatively impact the businesses of our major customers could materially and adversely affect us even if the customer represents less than 10% of our 2023 consolidated net sales.        14     Table of Contents We may not achieve all of the expected benefits from our restructuring programs. In 2022, we announced restructuring plans related to four facility consolidations as further described in ""Overview - Key Factors Affecting our Business - Restructuring"" in Item 7 of this Annual Report. Management has estimated that these initiatives will result in restructuring costs of approximately $13.4 million ($6.3 million of which was incurred through December 31, 2023), incremental capital expenditures of approximately $5 million and once complete, annualized cost savings of approximately $6.9 million. Additionally, in connection with a new restructuring initiative implemented in the fourth quarter of 2023 involving the transition of certain manufacturing from our Glen Rock, Pennsylvania facility to other existing Bel sites as further described in ""Overview – Key Factors Affecting our Business – Restructuring"" in Item 7 of this Annual Report, management estimated that the initiative will result in restructuring costs of approximately $0.5 million ($0.4 million of which was incurred through December 31, 2023) and once complete, annualized cost savings of approximately $1.0 million. We made certain assumptions in estimating the anticipated savings we expect to achieve related to these initiatives, which include the estimated savings from the elimination of certain headcount and the consolidation of facilities. These assumptions may turn out to be incorrect due to a variety of factors. In addition, our ability to realize the expected benefits from these programs is subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unsuccessful in implementing these programs or if we do not achieve our expected results, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected or our business operations could be disrupted. As mentioned above, the amounts set forth in the foregoing including anticipated restructuring costs, incremental capital expenditure spend and annualized cost savings are the Company’s current estimates based on information presently available to the Company, assumptions and circumstances as they exist in each case at the time of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and are subject to change. See ""Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Information."" FINANCIAL RISKS There are several factors which can cause our margins to suffer. Our margins could be substantially impacted by the following factors.    ●  Declines in Selling Prices: The average selling prices for our products tend to decrease over their life cycles, and customers put pressure on suppliers to lower prices even when production costs are increasing. Further, increased competition from low-cost suppliers around the world has put additional pressures on pricing. Any drop in demand for our products or increase in supply of competitive products could also cause a significant drop in our average sales prices.     ●  Increases in Material Costs: While we continually strive to negotiate better pricing for components and raw materials, there are many factors that could lead to higher material costs, or premiums incurred for expedited orders, including an increase in industry demand for or supplier shortages of certain components, or inflationary pressures. Further, commodity prices, especially those pertaining to gold, copper and silver, can be volatile. Fluctuations in these prices and other commodity prices associated with Bel's raw materials will have a corresponding impact on our profit margins.    ●  Increases in Labor Costs: Wage rates, particularly in the PRC, Mexico and Slovakia where the majority of our manufacturing associates are located, have been gradually increasing in recent years as government-mandated increases in the minimum wage rate in these jurisdictions cause an increase in our overall pay scale. Labor costs can also be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rates in which local wages are paid as compared to the U.S. dollar.   Profit margins will be materially and adversely impacted if we are not able to reduce our costs of production, introduce technological innovations as sales prices decline, or pass through cost increases to customers. Our backlog figures may not be reliable indicators.  Many of the orders that comprise our backlog may be delayed, accelerated or canceled by customers without penalty. Customers may on occasion double order from multiple sources to ensure timely delivery when lead times are particularly long. Customers often cancel orders when business is weak and inventories are excessive. Additional factors that could cause the Company to fail to ship orders comprising our backlog include unanticipated supply difficulties, changes in customer demand and new customer designs. Throughout 2023, Bel has faced macroeconomic and excessive levels of inventory within the supply channel and these conditions expected to continue through at least the first half of 2024. Due to the foregoing factors, we cannot be certain that the amount of our backlog equals or exceeds the level of orders that will ultimately be delivered, and backlog may not be a reliable indicator of the timing of future sales. Our results of operations could be adversely impacted if customers cancel a material portion of orders in our backlog. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.  Our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.        15     Table of Contents If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay acquisitions, investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to effect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our credit agreement restricts our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default, the lenders under the credit agreement could terminate their commitments to loan money, the lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.  Our level of indebtedness could negatively impact our access to the capital markets and our ability to satisfy financial covenants under our existing credit agreement. Our U.S. debt service requirements are significant in relation to our U.S. revenue and cash flow. This leverage exposes us to risk in the event of downturns in our business, in our industry or in the economy generally, and may impair our operating flexibility and our ability to compete effectively. Our current credit agreement requires us to maintain certain covenant ratios. If we do not continue to satisfy these required ratios or receive waivers from our lenders, we will be in default under the credit agreement, which could result in an accelerated maturity of our debt obligations. We cannot assure investors that we will be able to access private or public debt or equity on satisfactory terms, or at all. Any equity financing that could be arranged may dilute existing shareholders and any debt financing that could be arranged may result in the imposition of more stringent financial and operating covenants. LEGAL, TAX AND REGULATORY RISKS We may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights and we may incur defense costs and possibly royalty obligations or lose the right to use technology important to our business. From time to time, we receive claims by third parties asserting that our products violate their intellectual property rights. Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be time consuming and expensive to litigate or settle and could divert management attention from administering our business. A third party asserting infringement claims against us or our customers with respect to our current or future products may materially and adversely affect us by, for example, causing us to enter into costly royalty arrangements or forcing us to incur settlement or litigation costs. We are subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions. As a result, any adverse development in the tax laws of any of these jurisdictions or any disagreement with our tax positions could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of operations. We are subject to taxation in, and to the tax laws and regulations of, multiple jurisdictions as a result of the international scope of our operations and our corporate and financing structure. We are also subject to transfer pricing laws with respect to our intercompany transactions, including those relating to the flow of funds among our companies. Adverse developments in fiscal or tax laws, regulations or policies, or any change in position regarding the application, administration or interpretation thereof, in any applicable jurisdiction, could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of our operations. In addition, the tax authorities in any applicable jurisdiction, including the United States, may disagree with the positions we have taken or intend to take regarding the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions. If any applicable tax authorities, including U.S. tax authorities, were to successfully challenge the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of our operations. Our results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted by environmental and other regulations.  Our manufacturing operations, products and/or product packaging are subject to environmental laws and regulations governing air emissions; wastewater discharges; the handling, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances, wastes and certain chemicals used or generated in our manufacturing processes; employee health and safety labeling or other notifications with respect to the content or other aspects of our processes, products or packaging; restrictions on the use of certain materials in or on design aspects of our products or product packaging; and, responsibility for disposal of products or product packaging. Discussions and proposals related to gas emissions and climate change have increasingly become the subject of substantial attention; additional regulation in this area could have the effect of restricting our business operations or increasing our operating costs. More stringent environmental regulations may be enacted in the future, and we cannot presently determine the modifications, if any, in our operations that any such future regulations might require, or the cost of compliance with these regulations.        16     Table of Contents ESG issues, including those related to climate change and sustainability, may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could damage our reputation. Companies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny relating to their ESG policies. Increased focus and activism related to ESG may hinder our access to capital, as investors may reconsider their capital investment as a result of their assessment of our ESG practices. In particular, investors, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focusing on environmental issues, including climate change, water use, waste and other sustainability concerns. Changing customer or consumer preferences may also result in increased demands regarding components and materials including packaging materials, including with respect to their environmental impact on sustainability. These demands could impact the profitability products, cause us to incur additional costs, to make changes to our operations, or to make additional commitments, set targets or establish additional goals and take actions to meet them, which could expose us to market, operational and execution costs or risks. In addition, governmental and non-governmental organizations, investors, customers, consumers, our employees and other stakeholders have placed increasing importance on ESG matters, and depending on their assessment of our ESG practices, certain investors may reconsider their investment in the Company. Concern over climate change, waste, consumption or use of materials including packaging materials, may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate impacts to the environment. Increased regulatory requirements, including in relation to various aspects of ESG including the SEC’s recent disclosure proposal on climate change, or environmental causes may result in increased compliance or input costs of energy, raw materials or compliance with emissions standards, which may cause disruptions in the manufacture of our products or an increase in operating costs. We may undertake additional costs to control, assess and report on ESG metrics as the nature, scope and complexity of ESG reporting, diligence and disclosure requirements expand. Our ability to achieve any stated goal, target, or objective is subject to numerous factors and conditions, many of which are outside of our control. Any failure to achieve our ESG goals or ambitions or a perception (whether or not valid) of our failure to act responsibly with respect to the environment or to effectively respond to new, or changes in, legal or regulatory requirements concerning environmental or other ESG matters, or increased operating or manufacturing costs due to increased regulation or environmental causes could adversely affect our business and reputation. If we do not adapt to or comply with new regulations, or fail to meet ESG goals or ambitions or evolving investor, industry or stakeholder expectations and standards, or if we are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for ESG issues, customers may choose to stop purchasing our products or purchase products from another company or a competitor, and our reputation, business or financial condition may be adversely affected. Expanding and evolving data privacy laws and regulations could impact our business and expose us to increased liability. Our global business is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations including but not limited to privacy, data security and data localization. Evolving foreign events may adversely affect our revenues and could subject us to new regulatory costs and challenges (such as the transfer of personal data between the EU and the United Kingdom), in addition to other adverse effects that we are unable to effectively anticipate. This may impose significant requirements on how we collect, process and transfer personal data, as well as significant financial penalties for non-compliance. Any inability to adequately address privacy concerns, even if unfounded, or to comply with the more complex privacy or data protection laws, regulations and privacy standards, could lead to significant financial penalties, which may result in a material and adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations.        17     Table of Contents RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK As a result of protective provisions in the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, the voting power of holders of Class A common shares whose voting rights are not suspended (including officers, directors and principal shareholders) may be increased at future meetings of the Company's shareholders. The Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, provides that if a shareholder, other than shareholders subject to specific exceptions, acquires (after the date of the Company's 1998 recapitalization) 10% or more of the outstanding Class A common stock and does not own an equal or greater percentage of all then outstanding shares of both Class A and Class B common stock (all of which common stock must have been acquired after the date of the 1998 recapitalization), such shareholder must, within 90 days of the trigger date, purchase Class B common shares, in an amount and at a price determined in accordance with a formula described in the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, or forfeit its right to vote its Class A common shares. As of February 29, 2024, to the Company's knowledge, there was one shareholder of the Company's common stock with ownership in excess of 10% of Class A outstanding shares with no ownership of the Company's Class B common stock and with no basis for exception from the operation of the above-mentioned provisions. In order to vote its shares at Bel's next shareholders' meeting, this shareholder must either purchase the required number of Class B common shares or sell or otherwise transfer Class A common shares until its Class A holdings are under 10%. As of February 29, 2024, to the Company's knowledge, this shareholder owned 16.7% of the Company's Class A common stock and had not taken steps to either purchase the required number of Class B common shares or sell or otherwise transfer Class A common shares until its Class A holdings fall below 10%. Unless and until this situation is satisfied in a manner permitted by the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, the subject shareholder will not be permitted to vote its shares of common stock. To the extent that the voting rights of particular holders of Class A common stock are suspended as of times when the Company's shareholders vote due to the above-mentioned provisions, such suspension will have the effect of increasing the voting power of those holders of Class A common shares whose voting rights are not suspended. As of February 29, 2024, Daniel Bernstein, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owned 382,032 Class A common shares (or 21.4%) of the outstanding Class A common shares whose voting rights were not suspended, and all directors and current executive officers as a group (which includes Daniel Bernstein) beneficially owned 396,175 Class A common shares (or 22.2%) of the outstanding Class A common shares whose voting rights were not suspended. Our stock price, like that of many companies, has been and may continue to be volatile. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate as a result of variations in our quarterly operating results and other factors beyond our control. These fluctuations may be exaggerated if the trading volume of our common stock is low. The market price of our common stock may rise and fall in response to a variety of other factors, including:  •  announcements of technological or competitive developments;  •  general market or economic conditions;  •  the continuing and uncertain future impact of the COVID pandemic on our operations and supply chain;  •  market or economic conditions specific to particular geographical areas in which we operate;  •  acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or our competitors; •our ability to achieve our anticipated cost savings from announced restructuring programs; •  the gain or loss of a significant customer or order; •changes in the amount or frequency of our payments of dividends or repurchases of our common stock; or •  changes in estimates of our financial performance or changes in recommendations by securities analysts regarding us or our industry.  In addition, equity securities of many companies have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations even in periods when the capital markets generally are not distressed. These price and volume fluctuations often have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies.        18     Table of Contents GENERAL RISKS The global nature of our operations exposes us to numerous risks that could materially adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations.  We manufacture in 7 countries, and our products are distributed in those countries as well as in other parts of the world. A large portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside of the United States and a large portion of our sales are generated outside of the United States. Operations outside of the United States, particularly operations in developing regions, are subject to various risks that may not be present or as significant for our U.S. operations. Economic uncertainty in some of the geographic regions in which we operate, including developing regions, could result in the disruption of commerce and negatively impact cash flows from our operations in those areas. Risks inherent in our international operations include:   ●  COVID-related closures and other pandemic-related uncertainties in the countries in which we operate;   ●  Import and export regulations that could erode profit margins or restrict exports;   ●  Foreign exchange controls and tax rates;   ●  Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, including devaluations;   ●  Changes in regional and local economic conditions, including local inflationary pressures;   ●  Difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems;   ●  Variations in protection of intellectual property and other legal rights;   ●  More expansive legal rights of foreign unions or works councils;   ●  Changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;   ●  Inability or regulatory limitations on our ability to move goods across borders;   ●  Changes in laws and regulations, including the laws and policies of the United States affecting trade, tariffs and foreign investment;   ●  Restrictive governmental actions such as those on transfer or repatriation of funds and trade protection matters, including antidumping duties, tariffs, trade wars, embargoes and prohibitions or restrictions on acquisitions or joint ventures;   ●  Social plans that prohibit or increase the cost of certain restructuring actions;   ●  The potential for nationalization of enterprises or facilities; and   ●  Unsettled political conditions and possible terrorist attacks against U.S. or other interests.  As a multi-national company, we are faced with increased complexities due to recent changes to the U.S. corporate tax code relating to our unremitted foreign earnings, potential revisions to international tax law treaties, and renegotiated trade deals. In addition, other events, such as the ongoing discussion and negotiations concerning varying levels of tariffs on product imported from the PRC, also create a level of uncertainty. If we are unable to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks, it could have a material and adverse effect on our business, our consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition. The recent political tensions and armed conflict involving Russia and Ukraine continues to evolve and we are closely monitoring this dynamic situation. The Company has indefinitely ceased all shipments of product to customers in Russia. The Company's operations in Slovakia have not been, and are not currently expected to be, impacted by the political instability of the Russia-Ukraine conflict as our facility is not in close proximity to the Ukraine border. We do not currently anticipate any material impact to the Company's financial results. For additional information regarding risks associated with our operations in the PRC, see the discussion set forth above under the caption, ""We have substantial manufacturing operations located in the PRC, which exposes us to significant risks that could materially and adversely affect our business, operations, consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations.""        19     Table of Contents Cybersecurity risk and the failure to maintain the integrity of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties with which we do business, could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations. Cybersecurity threats, including but not limited to malware, phishing, credential harvesting, ransomware and other attacks, are rapidly evolving and are becoming increasingly sophisticated, making it difficult to detect and prevent such threats from impacting the Company. Our Company has seen an increased volume of cybersecurity threats and ransomware attempts in 2023 and expects to continue to experience cybersecurity threats from time to time, which pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers, or cybersecurity attacks or security breaches of our networks, systems or applications, could result in the loss of customers and business opportunities, legal liability, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, other litigation, regulatory and legal risks and the costs associated therewith, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, remediation costs, increased cybersecurity protection costs, additional compliance costs, increased insurance premiums, and lost revenues, damage to the Company's competitiveness, stock price, and long-term shareholder value, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we attempt to mitigate these risks, our systems, networks, products, solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced and persistent threats. We also maintain and have access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws and regulations. Despite our efforts to protect such sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, our facilities and systems and those of our customers and third-party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches, theft, fraud, misplaced or lost data, “Acts of God”, programming and/or human errors that could lead to the compromising of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, improper use of our systems, software solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations. A loss of the services of the Company's executive officers or other skilled associates could negatively impact our operations and results. The success of the Company's operations is largely dependent upon the performance of its executive officers, managers, engineers and salespeople. Many of these individuals have a significant number of years of experience within the Company and/or the industry in which we compete and would be extremely difficult to replace. The loss of the services of any of these associates may materially and adversely impact our results of operations if we are unable to replace them in a timely manner.  "
2,BELFB,BEL FUSE INC,2023-03-10,"  Risk Factors
 The risks described below should be carefully considered before making an investment decision. These are the risk factors that we consider to be material, but they are not the only risk factors that should be considered in making an investment decision. This Form 10-K also contains Forward-Looking Statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See the ""Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Information,"" above. Our business, consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of the risk factors described below, under ""Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Information"" or with respect to specific Forward-Looking Statements presented herein. The trading price of our securities could decline due to any of these risks, and investors in our securities may lose all or part of their investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business in the future.  Except as required by the federal securities law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any risk factor, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. STRATEGIC RISKS We conduct business in a highly competitive industry. Our business operates in a globally competitive industry, with relatively low barriers to entry. We compete principally on the basis of product performance, quality, reliability, depth of product line, customer service, technological innovation, design, delivery time and price. The industry in which we operate has become increasingly concentrated and globalized in recent years and our major competitors, many of which are larger than Bel, have significant financial resources and technological capabilities. Our intellectual property rights may not be adequately protected under the current state of the law. Our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights through patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and in other countries may not prevent misappropriation, and our failure or inability to protect our proprietary rights could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and future prospects. A third party could, without authorization, copy or otherwise appropriate our proprietary information. Our agreements with employees and others who participate in development activities could be breached, we may not have adequate remedies for any breach, and our trade secrets may otherwise become known or independently developed by competitors. Our acquisitions may not produce the anticipated results. A significant portion of our growth has been attributable to acquisitions. We cannot assure that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future. If an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our other businesses, our results of operations, enterprise value, market value and prospects could all be materially and adversely affected.  Integration of new acquisitions into our consolidated operations may result in lower average operating results for the group as a whole, and may divert management's focus from the ongoing operations of the Company during the integration period. Our strategy also focuses on the reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses through the integration or elimination of redundant sales facilities and administrative functions at acquired companies.  If we are unable to achieve our expectations with respect to our acquisitions, such inability could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations.  If the acquisitions fail to perform up to our expectations, or if there is a weakening of economic conditions, we could be required to record impairment charges on the goodwill associated with our acquisitions.  We are dependent on our ability to develop new products. Our future operating results are dependent, in part, on our ability to develop, produce and market new and more technologically advanced products. There are numerous risks inherent in this process, including the risks that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to timely develop and bring to market new products and applications to meet customers' changing needs.        11     Table of Contents OPERATIONAL RISKS Our global operations and demand for our products face risks related to health epidemics such as the coronavirus.  Any outbreaks of contagious diseases and other adverse public health developments in countries where we operate could have a material and adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations. In January 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 was first identified.  In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic, variants of which continue to spread and have ramifications throughout and upon the U.S. and the world. Over the past three years, our business was impacted by temporary facility closures, shelter-in-place orders and challenges related to travel restrictions imposed by the local governmental authorities.  Our suppliers, customers and our customers’ contract manufacturers have experienced similar challenges from time to time throughout the pandemic. The ongoing impact and continuing and future effects from the rapidly changing U.S. and global market and economic conditions due to the COVID-19 outbreak is uncertain, with disruptions to the business of our customers and suppliers, which have impacted, and could continue to impact, our business and consolidated results of operations and financial condition. During March 2022, the PRC government issued a notice with immediate effect whereby certain regions were temporarily shut down to perform widespread testing in response to a COVID outbreak in those regions and in accordance with Beijing’s ""zero-tolerance"" policy at the time.  Our Bel Power Solutions manufacturing facility in Shenzhen, China and our Magnetics TRP manufacturing facility in Changping, China were closed for approximately one week during the month of March 2022 while residents underwent testing. Upon the discontinuation of COVID protocols in the PRC in late 2022, we experienced approximately 3-4 weeks between December 2022 and January 2023 where the attendance rate of workers at our factories in the PRC were very low due to COVID outbreaks in the regions in which we operate. As the status of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, additional Bel facilities could become negatively impacted.  COVID-19 remains a potential supply continuity risk due to the unknown nature of future outbreaks including as a result of the emergence of further COVID-19 virus variants.  The extent to which COVID-19 will impact our business and our consolidated financial results will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at the time of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  See ""The Effects of COVID-19 on Bel’s Business"" in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of how COVID-19 is currently impacting our business. We may experience labor unrest. As we periodically implement transfers of certain of our operations, we may experience strikes or other types of labor unrest as a result of lay-offs or termination of employees in higher labor cost countries.  Our manufacturing facilities in the United Kingdom and Mexico are represented by labor unions and substantially all of our factory workers in the PRC are represented by government-sponsored unions. We may experience labor shortages. Government, economic, social and labor policies in the PRC may cause shortages of factory labor in areas where we have some of our products manufactured.  Further, availability of labor in the PRC is cyclical and is significantly affected by the migration of workers in relation to the annual Lunar New Year holiday.  If we are required to manufacture more of these products outside of the PRC as a result of such shortages, our margins will likely be materially adversely affected. A shortage of availability or an increase in the cost of raw materials, components and other resources may adversely impact our ability to procure these items at cost effective prices and thus may negatively impact profit margins. Additionally, inflationary pressures could result in higher input costs and materially adversely affect our financial results. Our results of operations may be materially adversely impacted by difficulties in obtaining raw materials, supplies, power, labor, natural resources and any other items needed for the production of our products, as well as by the effects of quality deviations in raw materials and the effects of significant fluctuations in the prices of existing inventories and purchase commitments for these materials.  Many of these materials and components are produced by a limited number of suppliers and their availability to us may be constrained by supplier capacity. Beginning in the third quarter of 2021, pandemic-related issues have created additional port congestion and intermittent supplier shutdowns and delays, resulting in additional expenses to expedite delivery of critical parts.  A further increase in demand for electronic components within the industry had led to incremental direct and indirect supply chain challenges related to raw material availability and logistics which persisted throughout 2022. We expect this environment to continue through at least the first half of 2023.  Any material disruption could materially adversely affect our financial results. In addition, inflationary pressures could result in higher input costs, including those related to our raw materials, labor, freight, utilities, healthcare and other expenses. Our future operating results will depend, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings initiatives and sourcing decisions, and any negative impact of inflation could materially adversely affect our financial results. See “The Effects of COVID-19 on Bel’s Business” and ""Other Key Factors Affecting our Business"" in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of how pricing and availability of materials is currently impacting our business.        12     Table of Contents We have substantial manufacturing operations located in the PRC, which exposes us to significant risks that could materially and adversely affect our business, operations, consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations. The majority of Bel's Magnetic Solutions manufacturing capacity and supplier base is located in the PRC, as is a portion of Bel's Power Solutions and Protection group.  As of December 31, 2022, 56% of our associates, 68% of our owned or leased manufacturing facilities (by square footage) and 35% of our Company’s tangible assets were all located in the PRC.  Our Company’s presence and operations in the PRC expose us to significant risks that could materially and adversely affect our Company and our business, operations, financial position and results of operations. For example, our significant operational presence in the PRC exposes us to foreign currency exchange risk. Our PRC-based manufacturing associates’ salaries, and other labor and overhead costs, associated with our PRC operations are paid in the Chinese renminbi.  As a result, the cost of our operations and our consolidated operating results may be adversely impacted by the effects of fluctuations in the applicable exchange rate for the renminbi as compared to the U.S dollar. Our significant labor force based within the PRC subjects us to risks associated with staffing and managing this substantial complement of factory workers and other associates who are important to our Company’s operations and success.  As noted above, factory workers in the PRC are represented by government-sponsored unions, and are participants in a cyclical labor market that may become subject to shortages including as a result of PRC government policies.  See “We may experience labor unrest” and “We may experience labor shortages” above.  Wage rates in the PRC have been increasing in recent years as PRC government-mandated increases in the minimum wage rate have caused an increase in our overall pay scale for our PRC workers.  The PRC government has broad authority and discretion to regulate the economy, manufacturing, industry, and the technology sector, among other areas generally.  As a result, our activities and operations in the PRC as well as those of our PRC-based suppliers are subject to extensive local government regulation.  Additionally, the PRC government has implemented policies from time to time to regulate economic expansion.  It exercises significant control over its economic growth through the allocation of resources, setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies.  Any additional new regulations or the amendment of previously implemented regulations could require us to change our business plans, increase our costs, or limit our ability to manufacture and sell products domestically and/or otherwise restrict or curtail our operations in the PRC.  To the extent our suppliers in the PRC are negatively impacted by new or amended regulations, any such negative implications could adversely impact our supply chain, including in the form of increased costs, disruptions, shortages or unavailability of product or component parts, and/or other deleterious consequences, which could materially adversely affect our business and operating results.  In late 2022, there were widespread COVID outbreaks, due to relaxing of government mandates, at our factories and those related to our supply chain in the PRC.  While these events did not have a material impact on our business and are not presently ongoing as of the date of this filing, any prolonged shutdown of our or our suppliers' factories (or other interference or limitation of production capacity resulting from other PRC infrastructure issues or government regulations, policies, mandates or otherwise), could cause significant disruption to our supply chain and/or Bel's ability to manufacture its products, and have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results.        13     Table of Contents Our significant manufacturing operations in the PRC also expose us to other risks.  Risks inherent in our PRC operations include the following:   ●  changes in import, export, transportation regulations and tariffs, and risks associated with boycotts and embargoes;   ●  changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements or restrictions, including tax and trade laws in the U.S. and in the PRC, and government action to restrict our ability to sell to customers where sales of products may require export licenses;   ●  transportation delays and other supply chain issues;   ●  changes in tax regulations in the U.S. and/or the PRC, including restrictions and/or taxes applicable to the transfer or repatriation of funds;   ●  international political relationships, including the relationship between the U.S. and the PRC;   ●  epidemics and illnesses (including COVID-19, and any new variants that may emerge) within the PRC that affect the areas in which we operate and manufacture our products;   ●  economic, social and political instability;   ●  longer accounts receivable collection cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivables;   ●  less effective protection of intellectual property and contractual arrangements, and risks associated with enforcing contracts and legal rights and remedies generally;   ●  uncertainties associated with the PRC legal system, which is based on civil law, can involve protected proceedings involving substantial judicial discretion, and is based in part on PRC government policies and internal rules, some of which are not published on a timely basis, or at all, and may have retroactive effect;   ●  risks arising out of any changes in governmental and economic policy and the potential for adverse developments arising out of any political or economic instability related to Hong Kong or Taiwan;   ●  the potential for political unrest, expropriation, nationalization, revolution, war or acts of terrorism; and   ●  risks associated with the concentration of a substantial portion of our manufacturing capacity and supplier base in the PRC.  In addition to the risks associated with our PRC operations described above, the global nature of our operations generally subjects us to additional risks.  We conduct operations in 15 countries, and outside of the United States (and the PRC), our largest manufacturing operations and associate populations are located within Mexico, Slovakia, the Dominican Republic, India and the United Kingdom.  Please see the Risk Factor appearing below under the caption, “The global nature of our operations exposes us to numerous risks that could materially adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations.” The loss of certain substantial customers could materially and adversely affect us. During the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 17.6% of the Company's total net sales were sold to one ultimate end-user through various intermediary contract manufacturers.  The largest Bel direct-customer was an intermediary contract manufacturer that manufactured and assembled products to various end customers, which represented 12.8% of our 2022 consolidated net sales.  While Bel sells a diversified portfolio of products to this ultimate end-user, we believe that the loss of either of this ultimate end user and/or this intermediate contract manufacturer could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations.  We have experienced significant concentrations of customers in prior years. See Note 13, ""Segments"" for additional disclosures related to our significant customers.  Furthermore, factors that negatively impact the businesses of our major customers could materially and adversely affect us even if the customer represents less than 10% of our 2022 consolidated net sales.        14     Table of Contents We may not achieve all of the expected benefits from our restructuring programs. In 2022, we announced restructuring plans related to four facility consolidations as further described in ""Other Key Factors Affecting our Business"" in Item 7 of this Annual Report. Management has estimated that these initiatives will result in restructuring costs of approximately $12 million ($7.3 million of which was incurred through December 31, 2022), incremental capital expenditures of approximately $5 million and once complete, annualized cost savings of approximately $5 million. We made certain assumptions in estimating the anticipated savings we expect to achieve related to these initiatives, which include the estimated savings from the elimination of certain headcount and the consolidation of facilities. These assumptions may turn out to be incorrect due to a variety of factors. In addition, our ability to realize the expected benefits from these programs is subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unsuccessful in implementing these programs or if we do not achieve our expected results, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected or our business operations could be disrupted. As mentioned above, the amounts set forth in the foregoing including anticipated restructuring costs, incremental capital expenditure spend and annualized cost savings are the Company’s current estimates based on information presently available to the Company, assumptions and circumstances as they exist in each case at the time of filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and are subject to change. See ""Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Information."" There are risks related to the implementation of our new global enterprise resource planning system. We have been engaged in a multi-year process of conforming the majority of our operations onto one global enterprise resource planning system (""ERP"").  The ERP is designed to improve the efficiency of our supply chain and financial transaction processes, accurately maintain our books and records, and provide information important to the operation of the business to our management team.  While this project is substantially complete, the conversion of recent acquisitions onto the new ERP system, or any significant deficiency in the design and implementation of the ERP could negatively impact data processing and electronic communications among business locations, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of operations.   FINANCIAL RISKS There are several factors which can cause our margins to suffer. Our margins could be substantially impacted by the following factors.    ●  Declines in Selling Prices: The average selling prices for our products tend to decrease over their life cycles, and customers put pressure on suppliers to lower prices even when production costs are increasing. Further, increased competition from low-cost suppliers around the world has put additional pressures on pricing. Any drop in demand for our products or increase in supply of competitive products could also cause a dramatic drop in our average sales prices.     ●  Increases in Material Costs: While we continually strive to negotiate better pricing for components and raw materials, there are many factors that could lead to higher material costs, or premiums incurred for expedited orders, including an increase in industry demand for or supplier shortages of certain components, or inflationary pressures. Further, commodity prices, especially those pertaining to gold, copper and silver, can be volatile.  Fluctuations in these prices and other commodity prices associated with Bel's raw materials will have a corresponding impact on our profit margins.    ●  Increases in Labor Costs: Wage rates, particularly in the PRC, Mexico and Slovakia where the majority of our manufacturing associates are located, have been gradually increasing in recent years as government-mandated increases in the minimum wage rate in these jurisdictions cause an increase in our overall pay scale.  Labor costs can also be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rates in which local wages are paid as compared to the U.S. dollar.   Profit margins will be materially and adversely impacted if we are not able to reduce our costs of production, introduce technological innovations as sales prices decline, or pass through cost increases to customers. Our backlog figures may not be reliable indicators.  Many of the orders that comprise our backlog may be delayed, accelerated or canceled by customers without penalty. Customers may on occasion double order from multiple sources to ensure timely delivery when lead times are particularly long. Customers often cancel orders when business is weak and inventories are excessive.  Additional factors that could cause the Company to fail to ship orders comprising our backlog include unanticipated supply difficulties, changes in customer demand and new customer designs.  Throughout 2022, Bel has faced macroeconomic and global supply chain challenges, and these conditions are expected to continue through at least the first half of 2023.  Due to the foregoing factors, we cannot be certain that the amount of our backlog equals or exceeds the level of orders that will ultimately be delivered, and backlog may not be a reliable indicator of the timing of future sales. Our results of operations could be adversely impacted if customers cancel a material portion of orders in our backlog. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.  Our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.        15     Table of Contents If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay acquisitions, investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to effect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our credit agreement restricts our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default, the lenders under the credit agreement could terminate their commitments to loan money, the lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.  Our level of indebtedness could negatively impact our access to the capital markets and our ability to satisfy financial covenants under our existing credit agreement. Our U.S. debt service requirements are significant in relation to our U.S. revenue and cash flow.  This leverage exposes us to risk in the event of downturns in our business, in our industry or in the economy generally, and may impair our operating flexibility and our ability to compete effectively.  Our current credit agreement requires us to maintain certain covenant ratios.  If we do not continue to satisfy these required ratios or receive waivers from our lenders, we will be in default under the credit agreement, which could result in an accelerated maturity of our debt obligations.  We cannot assure investors that we will be able to access private or public debt or equity on satisfactory terms, or at all.  Any equity financing that could be arranged may dilute existing shareholders and any debt financing that could be arranged may result in the imposition of more stringent financial and operating covenants. LEGAL, TAX AND REGULATORY RISKS We may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights and we may incur defense costs and possibly royalty obligations or lose the right to use technology important to our business. From time to time, we receive claims by third parties asserting that our products violate their intellectual property rights.  Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be time consuming and expensive to litigate or settle and could divert management attention from administering our business.  A third party asserting infringement claims against us or our customers with respect to our current or future products may materially and adversely affect us by, for example, causing us to enter into costly royalty arrangements or forcing us to incur settlement or litigation costs. We are subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions. As a result, any adverse development in the tax laws of any of these jurisdictions or any disagreement with our tax positions could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of operations. We are subject to taxation in, and to the tax laws and regulations of, multiple jurisdictions as a result of the international scope of our operations and our corporate and financing structure. We are also subject to transfer pricing laws with respect to our intercompany transactions, including those relating to the flow of funds among our companies. Adverse developments in fiscal or tax laws, regulations or policies, or any change in position regarding the application, administration or interpretation thereof, in any applicable jurisdiction, could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of our operations. In addition, the tax authorities in any applicable jurisdiction, including the United States, may disagree with the positions we have taken or intend to take regarding the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions. If any applicable tax authorities, including U.S. tax authorities, were to successfully challenge the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of our operations. Our results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted by environmental and other regulations.  Our manufacturing operations, products and/or product packaging are subject to environmental laws and regulations governing air emissions; wastewater discharges; the handling, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances, wastes and certain chemicals used or generated in our manufacturing processes; employee health and safety labeling or other notifications with respect to the content or other aspects of our processes, products or packaging; restrictions on the use of certain materials in or on design aspects of our products or product packaging; and, responsibility for disposal of products or product packaging. Discussions and proposals related to gas emissions and climate change have increasingly become the subject of substantial attention; additional regulation in this area could have the effect of restricting our business operations or increasing our operating costs.  More stringent environmental regulations may be enacted in the future, and we cannot presently determine the modifications, if any, in our operations that any such future regulations might require, or the cost of compliance with these regulations.        16     Table of Contents ESG issues, including those related to climate change and sustainability, may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could damage our reputation. Companies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny relating to their ESG policies. Increased focus and activism related to ESG may hinder our access to capital, as investors may reconsider their capital investment as a result of their assessment of our ESG practices. In particular, investors, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focusing on environmental issues, including climate change, water use, waste and other sustainability concerns. Changing customer or consumer preferences may also result in increased demands regarding components and materials including packaging materials, including with respect to their environmental impact on sustainability. These demands could impact the profitability products, cause us to incur additional costs, to make changes to our operations, or to make additional commitments, set targets or establish additional goals and take actions to meet them, which could expose us to market, operational and execution costs or risks. In addition, governmental and non-governmental organizations, investors, customers, consumers, our employees and other stakeholders have placed increasing importance on ESG matters, and depending on their assessment of our ESG practices, certain investors may reconsider their investment in the Company. Concern over climate change, waste, consumption or use of materials including packaging materials, may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate impacts to the environment. Increased regulatory requirements, including in relation to various aspects of ESG including the SEC’s recent disclosure proposal on climate change, or environmental causes may result in increased compliance or input costs of energy, raw materials or compliance with emissions standards, which may cause disruptions in the manufacture of our products or an increase in operating costs. We may undertake additional costs to control, assess and report on ESG metrics as the nature, scope and complexity of ESG reporting, diligence and disclosure requirements expand. Our ability to achieve any stated goal, target, or objective is subject to numerous factors and conditions, many of which are outside of our control. Any failure to achieve our ESG goals or ambitions or a perception (whether or not valid) of our failure to act responsibly with respect to the environment or to effectively respond to new, or changes in, legal or regulatory requirements concerning environmental or other ESG matters, or increased operating or manufacturing costs due to increased regulation or environmental causes could adversely affect our business and reputation. If we do not adapt to or comply with new regulations, or fail to meet ESG goals or ambitions or evolving investor, industry or stakeholder expectations and standards, or if we are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for ESG issues, customers may choose to stop purchasing our products or purchase products from another company or a competitor, and our reputation, business or financial condition may be adversely affected. Expanding and evolving data privacy laws and regulations could impact our business and expose us to increased liability. Our global business is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations including but not limited to privacy, data security and data localization. Evolving foreign events, including the effect of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, may adversely affect our revenues and could subject us to new regulatory costs and challenges (such as the transfer of personal data between the EU and the United Kingdom), in addition to other adverse effects that we are unable to effectively anticipate. This may impose significant requirements on how we collect, process and transfer personal data, as well as significant financial penalties for non-compliance.  Any inability to adequately address privacy concerns, even if unfounded, or to comply with the more complex privacy or data protection laws, regulations and privacy standards, could lead to significant financial penalties, which may result in a material and adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations.        17     Table of Contents RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK As a result of protective provisions in the Company's certificate of incorporation, the voting power of holders of Class A common shares whose voting rights are not suspended (including officers, directors and principal shareholders) may be increased at future meetings of the Company's shareholders. The Company's certificate of incorporation provides that if a shareholder, other than shareholders subject to specific exceptions, acquires (after the date of the Company's 1998 recapitalization) 10% or more of the outstanding Class A common stock and does not own an equal or greater percentage of all then outstanding shares of both Class A and Class B common stock (all of which common stock must have been acquired after the date of the 1998 recapitalization), such shareholder must, within 90 days of the trigger date, purchase Class B common shares, in an amount and at a price determined in accordance with a formula described in the Company's certificate of incorporation, or forfeit its right to vote its Class A common shares. As of February 28, 2023, to the Company's knowledge, there was one shareholder of the Company's common stock with ownership in excess of 10% of Class A outstanding shares with no ownership of the Company's Class B common stock and with no basis for exception from the operation of the above-mentioned provisions. In order to vote its shares at Bel's next shareholders' meeting, this shareholder must either purchase the required number of Class B common shares or sell or otherwise transfer Class A common shares until its Class A holdings are under 10%. As of February 28, 2023, to the Company's knowledge, this shareholder owned17.9% of the Company's Class A common stock and had not taken steps to either purchase the required number of Class B common shares or sell or otherwise transfer Class A common shares until its Class A holdings fall below 10%.  Unless and until this situation is satisfied in a manner permitted by the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the subject shareholder will not be permitted to vote its shares of common stock. To the extent that the voting rights of particular holders of Class A common stock are suspended as of times when the Company's shareholders vote due to the above-mentioned provisions, such suspension will have the effect of increasing the voting power of those holders of Class A common shares whose voting rights are not suspended.  As of February 28, 2023, Daniel Bernstein, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owned 381,720 Class A common shares (or 21.7%) of the outstanding Class A common shares whose voting rights were not suspended, and all directors and current executive officers as a group (which includes Daniel Bernstein) beneficially owned 397,505 Class A common shares (or 22.4%) of the outstanding Class A common shares whose voting rights were not suspended. Our stock price, like that of many companies, has been and may continue to be volatile. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate as a result of variations in our quarterly operating results and other factors beyond our control.  These fluctuations may be exaggerated if the trading volume of our common stock is low.  The market price of our common stock may rise and fall in response to a variety of other factors, including:  •  announcements of technological or competitive developments;  •  general market or economic conditions;  •  the continuing and uncertain future impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and supply chain;  •  market or economic conditions specific to particular geographical areas in which we operate;  •  acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or our competitors; •our ability to achieve our anticipated cost savings from announced restructuring programs; •  the gain or loss of a significant customer or order; or  •  changes in estimates of our financial performance or changes in recommendations by securities analysts regarding us or our industry  In addition, equity securities of many companies have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations even in periods when the capital markets generally are not distressed.  These price and volume fluctuations often have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies.        18     Table of Contents  GENERAL RISKS The global nature of our operations exposes us to numerous risks that could materially adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations.  We operate in 15 countries, and our products are distributed in those countries as well as in other parts of the world. A large portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside of the United States and a large portion of our sales are generated outside of the United States. Operations outside of the United States, particularly operations in developing regions, are subject to various risks that may not be present or as significant for our U.S. operations. Economic uncertainty in some of the geographic regions in which we operate, including developing regions, could result in the disruption of commerce and negatively impact cash flows from our operations in those areas. Risks inherent in our international operations include:   ●  COVID-19-related closures and other pandemic-related uncertainties in the countries in which we operate;   ●  Import and export regulations that could erode profit margins or restrict exports;   ●  Foreign exchange controls and tax rates;   ●  Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, including devaluations;   ●  Changes in regional and local economic conditions, including local inflationary pressures;   ●  Difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems;   ●  Variations in protection of intellectual property and other legal rights;   ●  More expansive legal rights of foreign unions or works councils;   ●  Changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;   ●  Inability or regulatory limitations on our ability to move goods across borders;   ●  Changes in laws and regulations, including the laws and policies of the United States affecting trade, tariffs and foreign investment;   ●  Restrictive governmental actions such as those on transfer or repatriation of funds and trade protection matters, including antidumping duties, tariffs, trade wars, embargoes and prohibitions or restrictions on acquisitions or joint ventures;   ●  Social plans that prohibit or increase the cost of certain restructuring actions;   ●  The uncertainty surrounding the effect of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union;   ●  The potential for nationalization of enterprises or facilities; and   ●  Unsettled political conditions and possible terrorist attacks against U.S. or other interests.  As a multi-national company, we are faced with increased complexities due to recent changes to the U.S. corporate tax code relating to our unremitted foreign earnings, potential revisions to international tax law treaties, and renegotiated trade deals.  In addition, other events, such as the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union and the ongoing discussion and negotiations concerning varying levels of tariffs on product imported from the PRC also create a level of uncertainty.  If we are unable to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks, it could have a material and adverse effect on our business, our consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition. The recent political tensions and armed conflict involving Russia and Ukraine continues to evolve and we are closely monitoring this dynamic situation.  The Company has indefinitely ceased all shipments of product to customers in Russia. The Company's operations in Slovakia have not been, and are not currently expected to be, impacted by the political instability of the Russia-Ukraine conflict as our facility is not in close proximity to the Ukraine border.  We do not currently anticipate any material impact to the Company's financial results. For additional information regarding risks associated with our operations in the PRC, see the discussion set forth above under the caption, “We have substantial manufacturing operations located in the PRC, which exposes us to significant risks that could materially and adversely affect our business, operations, consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations.”        19     Table of Contents Cyber risk and the failure to maintain the integrity of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties with which we do business, could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations. Cyber threats, including but not limited to malware, phishing, credential harvesting, ransomware and other attacks, are rapidly evolving and are becoming increasingly sophisticated, making it difficult to detect and prevent such threats from impacting the Company. Our Company has seen an increased volume of cyber threats and ransomware attempts throughout the COVID-19 pandemic and expects to continue to experience cyber threats from time to time, which pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers, or cyber-attacks or security breaches of our networks or systems, could result in the loss of customers and business opportunities, legal liability, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, other litigation, regulatory and legal risks and the costs associated therewith, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, remediation costs, increased cybersecurity protection costs, additional compliance costs, increased insurance premiums, and lost revenues, damage to the Company's competitiveness, stock price, and long-term shareholder value, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we attempt to mitigate these risks, our systems, networks, products, solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced and persistent threats. We also maintain and have access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws and regulations. Despite our efforts to protect such sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, our facilities and systems and those of our customers and third-party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches, theft, fraud, misplaced or lost data, “Acts of God”, programming and/or human errors that could lead to the compromising of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, improper use of our systems, software solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations. A loss of the services of the Company's executive officers or other skilled associates could negatively impact our operations and results. The success of the Company's operations is largely dependent upon the performance of its executive officers, managers, engineers and salespeople.  Many of these individuals have a significant number of years of experience within the Company and/or the industry in which we compete and would be extremely difficult to replace.  The loss of the services of any of these associates may materially and adversely impact our results of operations if we are unable to replace them in a timely manner.  "
5,BELFB,BEL FUSE INC,2022-03-14,"  Risk Factors
 The risks described below should be carefully considered before making an investment decision. These are the risk factors that we consider to be material, but they are not the only risk factors that should be considered in making an investment decision. This Form 10-K also contains Forward-Looking Statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See the ""Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Information,"" above. Our business, consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of the risk factors described below, under ""Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Information"" or with respect to specific Forward-Looking Statements presented herein. The trading price of our securities could decline due to any of these risks, and investors in our securities may lose all or part of their investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business in the future.  Except as required by the federal securities law, we undertake no obligation to update or revise any risk factor, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. STRATEGIC RISKS We conduct business in a highly competitive industry. Our business operates in a globally competitive industry, with relatively low barriers to entry. We compete principally on the basis of product performance, quality, reliability, depth of product line, customer service, technological innovation, design, delivery time and price. The industry in which we operate has become increasingly concentrated and globalized in recent years and our major competitors, some of which are larger than Bel, have significant financial resources and technological capabilities. Our intellectual property rights may not be adequately protected under the current state of the law. Our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights through patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and in other countries may not prevent misappropriation, and our failure or inability to protect our proprietary rights could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and future prospects. A third party could, without authorization, copy or otherwise appropriate our proprietary information. Our agreements with employees and others who participate in development activities could be breached, we may not have adequate remedies for any breach, and our trade secrets may otherwise become known or independently developed by competitors. Our acquisitions may not produce the anticipated results. A significant portion of our growth has been attributable to acquisitions. We cannot assure that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future. If an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our other businesses, our results of operations, enterprise value, market value and prospects could all be materially and adversely affected.  Integration of new acquisitions into our consolidated operations may result in lower average operating results for the group as a whole, and may divert management's focus from the ongoing operations of the Company during the integration period. Our strategy also focuses on the reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses through the integration or elimination of redundant sales facilities and administrative functions at acquired companies.  If we are unable to achieve our expectations with respect to our acquisitions, such inability could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations.  If the acquisitions fail to perform up to our expectations, or if there is a weakening of economic conditions, we could be required to record impairment charges on the goodwill associated with our acquisitions.  We are dependent on our ability to develop new products. Our future operating results are dependent, in part, on our ability to develop, produce and market new and more technologically advanced products. There are numerous risks inherent in this process, including the risks that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to timely develop and bring to market new products and applications to meet customers' changing needs.      9   Table of Contents OPERATIONAL RISKS Our global operations and demand for our products face risks related to health epidemics such as the coronavirus.  Any outbreaks of contagious diseases and other adverse public health developments in countries where we operate could have a material and adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations. In January 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 was first identified.  In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 a pandemic, which continues to spread throughout the U.S. and the world. Over the course of 2020 and 2021, our business was impacted by temporary facility closures, shelter-in-place orders and challenges related to travel restrictions imposed by the local governmental authorities.  Our suppliers, customers and our customers’ contract manufacturers have experienced similar challenges from time to time throughout the pandemic. The impact from the rapidly changing U.S. and global market and economic conditions due to the COVID-19 outbreak is uncertain, with disruptions to the business of our customers and suppliers, which has, and could continue, to impact our business and consolidated results of operations and financial condition. On March 13, 2022, the PRC government issued a notice whereby effective immediately, certain regions would be temporarily shut down to perform widespread testing in response to the recent COVID-19 outbreak, which includes our Bel Power Solutions manufacturing facility in Shenzhen, China and our Magnetics TRP manufacturing facility in Changping, China. Both are currently closed for a minimum of 3-5 business days.  COVID-19 remains a potential supply continuity risk due to the unknown nature of future outbreaks.   As the status of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to be uncertain, additional Bel facilities could become negatively impacted.  COVID-19 remains a potential supply continuity risk due to the unknown nature of future outbreaks including as a result of the emergence of COVID-19 virus variants.  The extent to which COVID-19 will impact our business and our consolidated financial results will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at the time of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  See ""The Effects of COVID-19 on Bel’s Business"" in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of how COVID-19 is currently impacting our business. We may experience labor unrest. As we periodically implement transfers of certain of our operations, we may experience strikes or other types of labor unrest as a result of lay-offs or termination of employees in higher labor cost countries.  Our manufacturing facilities in the United Kingdom and Mexico are represented by labor unions and substantially all of our factory workers in the PRC are represented by government-sponsored unions. We may experience labor shortages. Government, economic, social and labor policies in the PRC may cause shortages of factory labor in areas where we have some of our products manufactured.  Further, availability of labor in the PRC is cyclical and is significantly affected by the migration of workers in relation to the annual Lunar New Year holiday.  If we are required to manufacture more of these products outside of the PRC as a result of such shortages, our margins will likely be materially adversely affected. A shortage of availability or an increase in the cost of raw materials, components and other resources may adversely impact our ability to procure these items at cost effective prices and thus may negatively impact profit margins. Our results of operations may be materially adversely impacted by difficulties in obtaining raw materials, supplies, power, labor, natural resources and any other items needed for the production of our products, as well as by the effects of quality deviations in raw materials and the effects of significant fluctuations in the prices of existing inventories and purchase commitments for these materials.  Many of these materials and components are produced by a limited number of suppliers and their availability to us may be constrained by supplier capacity. Beginning in the third quarter of 2021, pandemic-related issues have created additional port congestion and intermittent supplier shutdowns and delays, resulting in additional expenses to expedite delivery of critical parts.  A recent increase in demand for electronic components within the industry had led to incremental direct and indirect supply chain challenges related to raw material availability and logistics and we expect this environment to continue in 2022.  Any material disruption could materially adversely affect our financial results.  See “The Effects of COVID-19 on Bel’s Business” and ""Other Key Factors Affecting our Business"" in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of how pricing and availability of materials is currently impacting our business.        10                   We have substantial manufacturing operations located in the PRC, which exposes us to significant risks that could materially and adversely affect our business, operations, consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations. The majority of Bel's Magnetic Solutions manufacturing capacity and supplier base is located in the PRC, as is a portion of Bel's Power Solutions and Protection group.  As of December 31, 2021, 62% of our associates, 73% of our owned or leased manufacturing facilities (by square footage) and 26% of our Company’s tangible assets were all located in the PRC.  Our Company’s presence and operations in the PRC expose us to significant risks that could materially and adversely affect our Company and our business, operations, financial position and results of operations. For example, our significant operational presence in the PRC exposes us to foreign currency exchange risk.  Our PRC-based manufacturing associates’ salaries, and other labor and overhead costs, associated with our PRC operations are paid in the Chinese Renminbi.  As a result, the cost of our operations and our consolidated operating results may be adversely impacted by the effects of fluctuations in the applicable exchange rate for the Renminbi as compared to the U.S dollar. Our significant labor force based within the PRC subjects us to risks associated with staffing and managing this substantial complement of factory workers and other associates who are important to our Company’s operations and success.  As noted above, factory workers in the PRC are represented by government-sponsored unions, and are participants in a cyclical labor market that may become subject to shortages including as a result of PRC government policies.  See “We may experience labor unrest” and “We may experience labor shortages” above.  Wage rates in the PRC have been gradually increasing in recent years as PRC government-mandated increases in the minimum wage rate have caused an increase in our overall pay scale for our PRC workers.  The PRC government has broad authority and discretion to regulate the economy, manufacturing, industry, and the technology sector, among other areas generally.  As a result, our activities and operations in PRC and as well as those of our PRC-based suppliers are subject to extensive local government regulation.  Additionally, the PRC government has implemented policies from time to time to regulate economic expansion.  It exercises significant control over its economic growth through the allocation of resources, setting monetary policy and providing preferential treatment to particular industries or companies.  Any additional new regulations or the amendment of previously implemented regulations could require us to change our business plans, increase our costs, or limit our ability to manufacture and sell products domestically and/or otherwise restrict or curtail our operations in the PRC.  To the extent our suppliers in the PRC are negatively impacted by new or amended regulations, any such negative implications could adversely impact our supply chain, including in the form of increased costs, disruptions, shortages or unavailability of product or component parts, and/or other deleterious consequences, which could materially adversely affect our business and operating results.  In 2021, there were power shortages in the PRC, resulting in the rationing of electricity in a number of provinces during peak production hours.  While these events did not have a material impact on our business and are not presently ongoing as of the date of this filing, any prolonged shutdown of our or our supplier’s factories (or other interference or limitation of production capacity resulting from other PRC infrastructure issues or government regulations, policies, mandates or otherwise), could cause significant disruption to our supply chain and/or Bel's ability to manufacture its products, and have a materially adverse effect on our business and operating results.        11                   Our significant manufacturing operations in the PRC also expose us to other risks.  Risks inherent in our PRC operations include the following:   ●  changes in import, export, transportation regulations and tariffs, and risks associated with boycotts and embargoes;   ●  changes in, or impositions of, legislative or regulatory requirements or restrictions, including tax and trade laws in the U.S. and in the PRC, and government action to restrict our ability to sell to customers where sales of products may require export licenses;   ●  transportation delays and other supply chain issues;   ●  changes in tax regulations in the U.S. and/or the PRC, including restrictions and/or taxes applicable to the transfer or repatriation of funds;   ●  international political relationships, including the relationship between the U.S. and the PRC;   ●  epidemics and illnesses (including COVID-19, and any new variants that may emerge) within the PRC that affect the areas in which we operate and manufacture our products;   ●  economic, social and political instability;   ●  longer accounts receivable collection cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivables;   ●  less effective protection of intellectual property and contractual arrangements, and risks associated with enforcing contracts and legal rights and remedies generally;   ●  uncertainties associated with the PRC legal system, which is based on civil law, can involve protected proceedings involving substantial judicial discretion, and is based in part on PRC government policies and internal rules, some of which are not published on a timely basis, or at all, and may have retroactive effect;   ●  risks arising out of any changes in governmental and economic policy and the potential for adverse developments arising out of any political or economic instability related to Hong Kong or Taiwan;   ●  the potential for political unrest, expropriation, nationalization, revolution, war or acts of terrorism; and   ●  risks associated with the concentration of a substantial portion of our manufacturing capacity and supplier base in the PRC.  In addition to the risks associated with our PRC operations described above, the global nature of our operations generally subjects us to additional risks.  We conduct operations in 15 countries, and outside of the United States (and the PRC), our largest manufacturing operations and associate populations are located within Mexico, Slovakia, the UK and India.  Please see the Risk Factor appearing below under the caption, “The global nature of our operations exposes us to numerous risks that could materially adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations.” The loss of certain substantial customers could materially and adversely affect us. During the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 18% of the Company's total net sales were sold to one ultimate end-user through various intermediary contract manufacturers.  The largest Bel direct-customer was an intermediary contract manufacturer that manufactured and assembled products to various end customers, which represented 10.6% of our 2021 consolidated net sales.  We believe that the loss of either of this ultimate end user and/or this intermediate contract manufacturer could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations.  We have experienced significant concentrations of customers in prior years. See Note 13, ""Segments"" for additional disclosures related to our significant customers.  Furthermore, factors that negatively impact the businesses of our major customers could materially and adversely affect us even if the customer represents less than 10% of our 2021 consolidated net sales.       12   Table of Contents We may not achieve all of the expected benefits from our restructuring programs. We have implemented a number of restructuring programs in recent years and we may continue to restructure or rationalize our operations in future periods. These programs include various cost savings, the consolidation of certain facilities and the reduction of headcount. We make certain assumptions in estimating the anticipated savings we expect to achieve under such programs, which include the estimated savings from the elimination of certain headcount and the consolidation of facilities. These assumptions may turn out to be incorrect due to a variety of factors. In addition, our ability to realize the expected benefits from these programs is subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unsuccessful in implementing these programs or if we do not achieve our expected results, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected or our business operations could be disrupted. There are risks related to the implementation of our new global enterprise resource planning system. We have been engaged in a multi-year process of conforming the majority of our operations onto one global enterprise resource planning system (""ERP"").  The ERP is designed to improve the efficiency of our supply chain and financial transaction processes, accurately maintain our books and records, and provide information important to the operation of the business to our management team.  While this project is substantially complete, the conversion of recent acquisitions onto the new ERP system, or any significant deficiency in the design and implementation of the ERP could negatively impact data processing and electronic communications among business locations, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of operations.   FINANCIAL RISKS There are several factors which can cause our margins to suffer. Our margins could be substantially impacted by the following factors.    ●  Declines in Selling Prices: The average selling prices for our products tend to decrease over their life cycles, and customers put pressure on suppliers to lower prices even when production costs are increasing. Further, increased competition from low-cost suppliers around the world has put additional pressures on pricing. Any drop in demand for our products or increase in supply of competitive products could also cause a dramatic drop in our average sales prices.     ●  Increases in Material Costs: While we continually strive to negotiate better pricing for components and raw materials, an increase in industry demand for or supplier shortages of certain components can result in higher material costs, or premiums incurred for expedited orders.  Further, commodity prices, especially those pertaining to gold, copper and silver, can be volatile.  Fluctuations in these prices and other commodity prices associated with Bel's raw materials will have a corresponding impact on our profit margins.    ●  Increases in Labor Costs: Wage rates, particularly in the PRC, Mexico and Slovakia where the majority of our manufacturing associates are located, have been gradually increasing in recent years as government-mandated increases in the minimum wage rate in these jurisdictions cause an increase in our overall pay scale.  Labor costs can also be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rates in which local wages are paid as compared to the U.S. dollar.   Profit margins will be materially and adversely impacted if we are not able to reduce our costs of production, introduce technological innovations as sales prices decline, or pass through cost increases to customers. Our backlog figures may not be reliable indicators.  Many of the orders that comprise our backlog may be delayed, accelerated or canceled by customers without penalty. Customers may on occasion double order from multiple sources to ensure timely delivery when lead times are particularly long. Customers often cancel orders when business is weak and inventories are excessive.  Additional factors that could cause the Company to fail to ship orders comprising our backlog include unanticipated supply difficulties, changes in customer demand and new customer designs.  Throughout 2021, Bel has faced macroeconomic and global supply chain challenges, and these conditions are expected to continue in 2022.  Due to the foregoing factors, we cannot be certain that the amount of our backlog equals or exceeds the level of orders that will ultimately be delivered, and backlog may not be a reliable indicator of the timing of future sales. Our results of operations could be adversely impacted if customers cancel a material portion of orders in our backlog. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.  Our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.      13   Table of Contents If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay acquisitions, investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to effect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our credit agreement restricts our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default, the lenders under the credit agreement could terminate their commitments to loan money, the lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.  Our level of indebtedness could negatively impact our access to the capital markets and our ability to satisfy financial covenants under our existing credit agreement. Our U.S. debt service requirements are significant in relation to our U.S. revenue and cash flow.  This leverage exposes us to risk in the event of downturns in our business, in our industry or in the economy generally, and may impair our operating flexibility and our ability to compete effectively.  Our current credit agreement requires us to maintain certain covenant ratios, and the ratios become more restrictive at specific dates during the term.  If we do not continue to satisfy these required ratios or receive waivers from our lenders, we will be in default under the credit agreement, which could result in an accelerated maturity of our debt obligations.  We cannot assure investors that we will be able to access private or public debt or equity on satisfactory terms, or at all.  Any equity financing that could be arranged may dilute existing shareholders and any debt financing that could be arranged may result in the imposition of more stringent financial and operating covenants.  LEGAL, TAX AND REGULATORY RISKS We may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights and we may incur defense costs and possibly royalty obligations or lose the right to use technology important to our business. From time to time, we receive claims by third parties asserting that our products violate their intellectual property rights.  Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be time consuming and expensive to litigate or settle and could divert management attention from administering our business.  A third party asserting infringement claims against us or our customers with respect to our current or future products may materially and adversely affect us by, for example, causing us to enter into costly royalty arrangements or forcing us to incur settlement or litigation costs. We are subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions. As a result, any adverse development in the tax laws of any of these jurisdictions or any disagreement with our tax positions could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of operations. We are subject to taxation in, and to the tax laws and regulations of, multiple jurisdictions as a result of the international scope of our operations and our corporate and financing structure. We are also subject to transfer pricing laws with respect to our intercompany transactions, including those relating to the flow of funds among our companies. Adverse developments in fiscal or tax laws, regulations or policies, or any change in position regarding the application, administration or interpretation thereof, in any applicable jurisdiction, could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of our operations. In addition, the tax authorities in any applicable jurisdiction, including the United States, may disagree with the positions we have taken or intend to take regarding the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions. If any applicable tax authorities, including U.S. tax authorities, were to successfully challenge the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of our operations. Expanding and evolving data privacy laws and regulations could impact our business and expose us to increased liability. Our global business is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations including but not limited to privacy, data security and data localization. Evolving foreign events, including the effect of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, may adversely affect our revenues and could subject us to new regulatory costs and challenges (such as the transfer of personal data between the EU and the United Kingdom), in addition to other adverse effects that we are unable to effectively anticipate. This may impose significant requirements on how we collect, process and transfer personal data, as well as significant financial penalties for non-compliance.  Any inability to adequately address privacy concerns, even if unfounded, or to comply with the more complex privacy or data protection laws, regulations and privacy standards, could lead to significant financial penalties, which may result in a material and adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations.        14     Table of Contents RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK As a result of protective provisions in the Company's certificate of incorporation, the voting power of holders of Class A common shares whose voting rights are not suspended (including officers, directors and principal shareholders) may be increased at future meetings of the Company's shareholders. The Company's certificate of incorporation provides that if a shareholder, other than shareholders subject to specific exceptions, acquires (after the date of the Company's 1998 recapitalization) 10% or more of the outstanding Class A common stock and does not own an equal or greater percentage of all then outstanding shares of both Class A and Class B common stock (all of which common stock must have been acquired after the date of the 1998 recapitalization), such shareholder must, within 90 days of the trigger date, purchase Class B common shares, in an amount and at a price determined in accordance with a formula described in the Company's certificate of incorporation, or forfeit its right to vote its Class A common shares. As of February 28, 2022, to the Company's knowledge, there was one shareholder of the Company's common stock with ownership in excess of 10% of Class A outstanding shares with no ownership of the Company's Class B common stock and with no basis for exception from the operation of the above-mentioned provisions. In order to vote its shares at Bel's next shareholders' meeting, this shareholder must either purchase the required number of Class B common shares or sell or otherwise transfer Class A common shares until its Class A holdings are under 10%. As of February 28, 2022, to the Company's knowledge, this shareholder owned 19.1% of the Company's Class A common stock and had not taken steps to either purchase the required number of Class B common shares or sell or otherwise transfer Class A common shares until its Class A holdings fall below 10%.  Unless and until this situation is satisfied in a manner permitted by the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the subject shareholder will not be permitted to vote its shares of common stock. To the extent that the voting rights of particular holders of Class A common stock are suspended as of times when the Company's shareholders vote due to the above-mentioned provisions, such suspension will have the effect of increasing the voting power of those holders of Class A common shares whose voting rights are not suspended.  As of February 28, 2022, Daniel Bernstein, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, beneficially owned 381,747 Class A common shares (or 21.9%) of the outstanding Class A common shares whose voting rights were not suspended, and all directors and current executive officers as a group (which includes Daniel Bernstein) beneficially owned 394,702 Class A common shares (or 22.5%) of the outstanding Class A common shares whose voting rights were not suspended. Our stock price, like that of many companies, has been and may continue to be volatile. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate as a result of variations in our quarterly operating results and other factors beyond our control.  These fluctuations may be exaggerated if the trading volume of our common stock is low.  The market price of our common stock may rise and fall in response to a variety of other factors, including:  •  announcements of technological or competitive developments;  •  general market or economic conditions;  •  the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and supply chain;  •  market or economic conditions specific to particular geographical areas in which we operate;  •  acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or our competitors;  •  the gain or loss of a significant customer or order; or  •  changes in estimates of our financial performance or changes in recommendations by securities analysts regarding us or our industry  In addition, equity securities of many companies have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations even in periods when the capital markets generally are not distressed.  These price and volume fluctuations often have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies.      15   Table of Contents Our results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted by environmental and other regulations.  Our manufacturing operations, products and/or product packaging are subject to environmental laws and regulations governing air emissions; wastewater discharges; the handling, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances, wastes and certain chemicals used or generated in our manufacturing processes; employee health and safety labeling or other notifications with respect to the content or other aspects of our processes, products or packaging; restrictions on the use of certain materials in or on design aspects of our products or product packaging; and, responsibility for disposal of products or product packaging. Discussions and proposals related to gas emissions and climate change have increasingly become the subject of substantial attention; additional regulation in this area could have the effect of restricting our business operations or increasing our operating costs.  More stringent environmental regulations may be enacted in the future, and we cannot presently determine the modifications, if any, in our operations that any such future regulations might require, or the cost of compliance with these regulations.  GENERAL RISKS The global nature of our operations exposes us to numerous risks that could materially adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations.  We operate in 15 countries, and our products are distributed in those countries as well as in other parts of the world. A large portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside of the United States and a large portion of our sales are generated outside of the United States. Operations outside of the United States, particularly operations in developing regions, are subject to various risks that may not be present or as significant for our U.S. operations. Economic uncertainty in some of the geographic regions in which we operate, including developing regions, could result in the disruption of commerce and negatively impact cash flows from our operations in those areas. Risks inherent in our international operations include:   ●  COVID-19-related closures and other pandemic-related uncertainties in the countries in which we operate;   ●  Import and export regulations that could erode profit margins or restrict exports;   ●  Foreign exchange controls and tax rates;   ●  Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, including devaluations;   ●  Changes in regional and local economic conditions, including local inflationary pressures;   ●  Difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems;   ●  Variations in protection of intellectual property and other legal rights;   ●  More expansive legal rights of foreign unions or works councils;   ●  Changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;   ●  Inability or regulatory limitations on our ability to move goods across borders;   ●  Changes in laws and regulations, including the laws and policies of the United States affecting trade, tariffs and foreign investment;   ●  Restrictive governmental actions such as those on transfer or repatriation of funds and trade protection matters, including antidumping duties, tariffs, trade wars, embargoes and prohibitions or restrictions on acquisitions or joint ventures;   ●  Social plans that prohibit or increase the cost of certain restructuring actions;   ●  The uncertainty surrounding the effect of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union;   ●  The potential for nationalization of enterprises or facilities; and   ●  Unsettled political conditions and possible terrorist attacks against U.S. or other interests.  As a multi-national company, we are faced with increased complexities due to recent changes to the U.S. corporate tax code relating to our unremitted foreign earnings, potential revisions to international tax law treaties, and renegotiated trade deals.  In addition, other events, such as the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union and the ongoing discussion and negotiations concerning varying levels of tariffs on product imported from the PRC also create a level of uncertainty.  If we are unable to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks, it could have a material and adverse effect on our business, our consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition. The recent political tensions and armed conflict involving Russia and Ukraine continues to evolve and we are closely monitoring this dynamic situation.  As of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company had indefinitely ceased all shipments of product to customers in Russia.  As of February 28, 2022, there were approximately $2 million of orders in our backlog that were impacted by this decision.  The Company's operations in Slovakia have not been, and are not currently expected to be, impacted by the political instability of the Russia-Ukraine conflict as our facility is not in close proximity to the Ukraine border.  We do not currently anticipate any material impact to the Company's financial results. For additional information regarding risks associated with our operations in the PRC, see the discussion set forth above under the caption, “We have substantial manufacturing operations located in the PRC, which exposes us to significant risks that could materially and adversely affect our business, operations, consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations.”      16   Table of Contents Cyber risk and the failure to maintain the integrity of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties with which we do business, could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Our Company expects to continue to experience cyber threats from time to time, which pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers, or cyber-attacks or security breaches of our networks or systems, could result in the loss of customers and business opportunities, legal liability, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, other litigation, regulatory and legal risks and the costs associated therewith, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, remediation costs, increased cybersecurity protection costs, additional compliance costs, increased insurance premiums, and lost revenues, damage to the Company's competitiveness, stock price, and long-term shareholder value, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we attempt to mitigate these risks, our systems, networks, products, solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced and persistent threats. We also maintain and have access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws and regulations. Despite our efforts to protect such sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, our facilities and systems and those of our customers and third-party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches, theft, fraud, misplaced or lost data, “Acts of God”, programming and/or human errors that could lead to the compromising of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, improper use of our systems, software solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations. A loss of the services of the Company's executive officers or other skilled associates could negatively impact our operations and results. The success of the Company's operations is largely dependent upon the performance of its executive officers, managers, engineers and salespeople.  Many of these individuals have a significant number of years of experience within the Company and/or the industry in which we compete and would be extremely difficult to replace.  The loss of the services of any of these associates may materially and adversely impact our results of operations if we are unable to replace them in a timely manner.  "
9,BELFB,BEL FUSE INC,2021-03-12,"  Risk Factors
 The risks described below should be carefully considered before making an investment decision. These are the risk factors that we consider to be material, but they are not the only risk factors that should be considered in making an investment decision. This Form 10-K also contains Forward-Looking Statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See the ""Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Information,"" above. Our business, consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of the risk factors described below, under ""Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Information"" or with respect to specific Forward-Looking Statements presented herein. The trading price of our securities could decline due to any of these risks, and investors in our securities may lose all or part of their investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business in the future. STRATEGIC RISKS We conduct business in a highly competitive industry. Our business is largely in a highly competitive worldwide industry, with relatively low barriers to competitive entry. We compete principally on the basis of product performance, quality, reliability, depth of product line, customer service, technological innovation, design, delivery time and price. The industry in which we operate has become increasingly concentrated and globalized in recent years and our major competitors, some of which are larger than Bel, have significant financial resources and technological capabilities. Our intellectual property rights may not be adequately protected under the current state of the law. Our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights through patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and in other countries may not prevent misappropriation, and our failure or inability to protect our proprietary rights could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and future prospects. A third party could, without authorization, copy or otherwise appropriate our proprietary information. Our agreements with employees and others who participate in development activities could be breached, we may not have adequate remedies for any breach, and our trade secrets may otherwise become known or independently developed by competitors. Our acquisitions may not produce the anticipated results. A significant portion of our growth has been attributable to acquisitions. We cannot assure that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future. If an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our other businesses, our results of operations, enterprise value, market value and prospects could all be materially and adversely affected.  Integration of new acquisitions into our consolidated operations may result in lower average operating results for the group as a whole, and may divert management's focus from the ongoing operations of the Company during the integration period. Our strategy also focuses on the reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses through the integration or elimination of redundant sales facilities and administrative functions at acquired companies.  If we are unable to achieve our expectations with respect to our acquisitions, such inability could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations.  During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $8.9 million due to weakened market conditions in our former North America operating segment.  If the acquisitions fail to perform up to our expectations, or if there is further weakening of economic conditions, we could be required to record additional impairment charges.  We are dependent on our ability to develop new products. Our future operating results are dependent, in part, on our ability to develop, produce and market new and more technologically advanced products. There are numerous risks inherent in this process, including the risks that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to timely develop and bring to market new products and applications to meet customers' changing needs.        8   Table of Contents OPERATIONAL RISKS Our global operations and demand for our products face risks related to health epidemics such as the coronavirus.  Any outbreaks of contagious diseases and other adverse public health developments in countries where we operate could have a material and adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations. In January 2020, the outbreak of COVID-19 was first identified and had an unfavorable impact on our four largest manufacturing facilities, which are located in China, throughout the first quarter of 2020.  Travel restrictions imposed by the local governmental authorities to control the spread of the virus resulted in an extended closure of our facilities in China over the Lunar New Year holiday, with the return of workers delayed after the holiday break.  Our overall worker return rate at our China facilities was approximately 85% by early March 2020 and these factories have been running at near normal productivity levels since that time.  Our suppliers, customers and our customers’ contract manufacturers were similarly impacted earlier in 2020, and the majority have returned to near pre-COVID-19 production levels.  Throughout the remainder of 2020, many of the jurisdictions in which we operate within North America and Europe had mandated shelter-in-place orders, with the exception of essential businesses.  As of the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, all of the Company's manufacturing sites were open, with certain locations at reduced workforce levels due to local government mandates.  As the status of the COVID-19 outbreak continues to be uncertain particularly in the U.S. and Europe, additional Bel facilities could become negatively impacted.  In addition, COVID-19 has adversely affected the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that has affected demand for certain of our end customers’ products. The extent to which COVID-19 will impact our business and our consolidated financial results will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at the time of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  See ""The Effects of COVID-19 on Bel’s Business"" in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of how COVID-19 is currently impacting our business. We may experience labor unrest. As we periodically implement transfers of certain of our operations, we may experience strikes or other types of labor unrest as a result of lay-offs or termination of employees in higher labor cost countries.  Our manufacturing facilities in the United Kingdom and Mexico are represented by labor unions and substantially all of our factory workers in the PRC are represented by government-sponsored unions. We may experience labor shortages. Government, economic, social and labor policies in the PRC may cause shortages of factory labor in areas where we have some of our products manufactured.  Further, availability of labor is cyclical and is significantly affected by the migration of workers in relation to the annual Lunar New Year holiday.  If we are required to manufacture more of these products outside of the PRC as a result of such shortages, our margins will likely be materially adversely affected. A shortage of availability or an increase in the cost of high-quality raw materials, components and other resources may adversely impact our ability to procure these items at cost effective prices and thus may negatively impact profit margins. Our results of operations may be materially adversely impacted by difficulties in obtaining raw materials, supplies, power, labor, natural resources and any other items needed for the production of our products, as well as by the effects of quality deviations in raw materials and the effects of significant fluctuations in the prices of existing inventories and purchase commitments for these materials.  Many of these materials and components are produced by a limited number of suppliers and their availability to us may be constrained by supplier capacity.  See ""Key Factors Affecting our Business"" in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of how pricing and availability of materials is currently impacting our business. The loss of certain substantial customers could materially and adversely affect us. During the year ended December 31, 2020, sales to one direct customer exceeded 10% of our consolidated net sales.  This customer, Hon Hai/Foxconn Technology Group, a contract manufacturer utilized by various end customers, represented 11.9% of our 2020 consolidated net sales.  We believe that the loss of this customer could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations.  We have experienced significant concentrations of customers in prior years. See Note 12, ""Segments"" for additional disclosures related to our significant customers.  Furthermore, factors that negatively impact the businesses of our major customers, such as the grounding of aircraft at a major commercial aerospace customer, could materially and adversely affect us even if the customer represents less than 10% of our 2020 consolidated net sales.       9   Table of Contents We may not achieve all of the expected benefits from our restructuring programs. We have implemented a number of restructuring programs in recent years and we may continue to restructure or rationalize our operations in future periods. These programs include various cost savings, the consolidation of certain facilities and the reduction of headcount. We make certain assumptions in estimating the anticipated savings we expect to achieve under such programs, which include the estimated savings from the elimination of certain headcount and the consolidation of facilities. These assumptions may turn out to be incorrect due to a variety of factors. In addition, our ability to realize the expected benefits from these programs is subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unsuccessful in implementing these programs or if we do not achieve our expected results, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected or our business operations could be disrupted. There are risks related to the implementation of our new global enterprise resource planning system. We are currently engaged in a multi-year process of conforming the majority of our operations onto one global enterprise resource planning system (""ERP"").  The ERP is designed to improve the efficiency of our supply chain and financial transaction processes, accurately maintain our books and records, and provide information important to the operation of the business to our management team. The implementation of the ERP will continue to require significant investment of human and financial resources, and we may experience significant delays, increased costs and other difficulties as a result. Any significant disruption or deficiency in the design and implementation of the ERP could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fulfill and invoice customer orders, apply cash receipts, place purchase orders with suppliers, and make cash disbursements, and could negatively impact data processing and electronic communications among business locations, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of operations. We also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing necessary upgrades to those systems while we implement the new ERP system. While we have invested significant resources in planning and project management, significant implementation issues may arise. FINANCIAL RISKS There are several factors which can cause our margins to suffer. Our margins could be substantially impacted by the following factors.    ●  Declines in Selling Prices: The average selling prices for our products tend to decrease over their life cycles, and customers put pressure on suppliers to lower prices even when production costs are increasing. Further, increased competition from low cost suppliers around the world has put additional pressures on pricing. Any drop in demand for our products or increase in supply of competitive products could also cause a dramatic drop in our average sales prices.     ●  Increases in Material Costs: While we continually strive to negotiate better pricing for components and raw materials, an increase in industry demand for or supplier shortages of certain components can result in higher material costs, or premiums incurred for expedited orders.  Further, commodity prices, especially those pertaining to gold, copper and silver, can be volatile.  Fluctuations in these prices and other commodity prices associated with Bel's raw materials will have a corresponding impact on our profit margins.    ●  Increases in Labor Costs: Wage rates, particularly in the PRC, Mexico and Slovakia where the majority of our manufacturing associates are located, have been gradually increasing in recent years as government-mandated increases in the minimum wage rate in these jurisdictions cause an increase in our overall pay scale.  Labor costs can also be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rates in which local wages are paid as compared to the U.S. dollar.   Profit margins will be materially and adversely impacted if we are not able to reduce our costs of production, introduce technological innovations as sales prices decline, or pass through cost increases to customers. Our backlog figures may not be reliable indicators.  Many of the orders that comprise our backlog may be delayed, accelerated or canceled by customers without penalty. Customers may on occasion double order from multiple sources to ensure timely delivery when lead times are particularly long. Customers often cancel orders when business is weak and inventories are excessive.  Therefore, we cannot be certain that the amount of our backlog equals or exceeds the level of orders that will ultimately be delivered. Our results of operations could be adversely impacted if customers cancel a material portion of orders in our backlog. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.  Our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.        10   Table of Contents If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay acquisitions, investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to effect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our credit agreement restricts our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default, the lenders under the credit agreement could terminate their commitments to loan money, the lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.  Our level of indebtedness could negatively impact our access to the capital markets and our ability to satisfy financial covenants under our existing credit agreement. Our U.S. debt service requirements are significant in relation to our U.S. revenue and cash flow.  This leverage exposes us to risk in the event of downturns in our business, in our industry or in the economy generally, and may impair our operating flexibility and our ability to compete effectively.  Our current credit agreement requires us to maintain certain covenant ratios, and the ratios become more restrictive at specific dates during the term.  If we do not continue to satisfy these required ratios or receive waivers from our lenders, we will be in default under the credit agreement, which could result in an accelerated maturity of our debt obligations.  We cannot assure investors that we will be able to access private or public debt or equity on satisfactory terms, or at all.  Any equity financing that could be arranged may dilute existing shareholders and any debt financing that could be arranged may result in the imposition of more stringent financial and operating covenants.  LEGAL, TAX AND REGULATORY RISKS We may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights and we may incur defense costs and possibly royalty obligations or lose the right to use technology important to our business. From time to time, we receive claims by third parties asserting that our products violate their intellectual property rights.  Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be time consuming and expensive to litigate or settle and could divert management attention from administering our business.  A third party asserting infringement claims against us or our customers with respect to our current or future products may materially and adversely affect us by, for example, causing us to enter into costly royalty arrangements or forcing us to incur settlement or litigation costs. We are subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions. As a result, any adverse development in the tax laws of any of these jurisdictions or any disagreement with our tax positions could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of operations. We are subject to taxation in, and to the tax laws and regulations of, multiple jurisdictions as a result of the international scope of our operations and our corporate and financing structure. We are also subject to transfer pricing laws with respect to our intercompany transactions, including those relating to the flow of funds among our companies. Adverse developments in fiscal or tax laws, regulations or policies, or any change in position regarding the application, administration or interpretation thereof, in any applicable jurisdiction, could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of our operations. In addition, the tax authorities in any applicable jurisdiction, including the United States, may disagree with the positions we have taken or intend to take regarding the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions. If any applicable tax authorities, including U.S. tax authorities, were to successfully challenge the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of our operations. Expanding and evolving data privacy laws and regulations could impact our business and expose us to increased liability. Our global business is subject to complex and changing laws and regulations including but not limited to privacy, data security and data localization. Evolving foreign events, including the effect of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, may adversely affect our revenues and could subject us to new regulatory costs and challenges (such as the transfer of personal data between the EU and the United Kingdom), in addition to other adverse effects that we are unable to effectively anticipate. This may impose significant requirements on how we collect, process and transfer personal data, as well as significant financial penalties for non-compliance.  Any inability to adequately address privacy concerns, even if unfounded, or to comply with the more complex privacy or data protection laws, regulations and privacy standards, could lead to significant financial penalties, which may result in a material and adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations.         11                   RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCK As a result of protective provisions in the Company's certificate of incorporation, the voting power of holders of Class A common shares whose voting rights are not suspended (including officers, directors and principal shareholders) may be increased at future meetings of the Company's shareholders. The Company's certificate of incorporation provides that if a shareholder, other than shareholders subject to specific exceptions, acquires (after the date of the Company's 1998 recapitalization) 10% or more of the outstanding Class A common stock and does not own an equal or greater percentage of all then outstanding shares of both Class A and Class B common stock (all of which common stock must have been acquired after the date of the 1998 recapitalization), such shareholder must, within 90 days of the trigger date, purchase Class B common shares, in an amount and at a price determined in accordance with a formula described in the Company's certificate of incorporation, or forfeit its right to vote its Class A common shares. As of February 28, 2021, to the Company's knowledge, there was one shareholder of the Company's common stock with ownership in excess of 10% of Class A outstanding shares with no ownership of the Company's Class B common stock and with no basis for exception from the operation of the above-mentioned provisions. In order to vote its shares at Bel's next shareholders' meeting, this shareholder must either purchase the required number of Class B common shares or sell or otherwise transfer Class A common shares until its Class A holdings are under 10%. As of February 28, 2021, to the Company's knowledge, this shareholder owned 21.6% of the Company's Class A common stock and had not taken steps to either purchase the required number of Class B common shares or sell or otherwise transfer Class A common shares until its Class A holdings fall below 10%.  Unless and until this situation is satisfied in a manner permitted by the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the subject shareholder will not be permitted to vote its shares of common stock. To the extent that the voting rights of particular holders of Class A common stock are suspended as of times when the Company's shareholders vote due to the above-mentioned provisions, such suspension will have the effect of increasing the voting power of those holders of Class A common shares whose voting rights are not suspended.  As of February 28, 2021, Daniel Bernstein, the Company's chief executive officer, beneficially owned 380,686 Class A common shares (or 22.6%) of the outstanding Class A common shares whose voting rights were not suspended, and all directors and current executive officers as a group (which includes Daniel Bernstein) beneficially owned 391,534 Class A common shares (or 23.1%) of the outstanding Class A common shares whose voting rights were not suspended. Our stock price, like that of many technology companies, has been and may continue to be volatile. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate as a result of variations in our quarterly operating results and other factors beyond our control.  These fluctuations may be exaggerated if the trading volume of our common stock is low.  The market price of our common stock may rise and fall in response to a variety of other factors, including:  •  announcements of technological or competitive developments;  •  general market or economic conditions;  •  the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and supply chain;  •  market or economic conditions specific to particular geographical areas in which we operate;  •  acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or our competitors;  •  the gain or loss of a significant customer or order; or  •  changes in estimates of our financial performance or changes in recommendations by securities analysts regarding us or our industry  In addition, equity securities of many technology companies have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations even in periods when the capital markets generally are not distressed.  These price and volume fluctuations often have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies.       12   Table of Contents Our results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted by environmental and other regulations.  Our manufacturing operations, products and/or product packaging are subject to environmental laws and regulations governing air emissions; wastewater discharges; the handling, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances, wastes and certain chemicals used or generated in our manufacturing processes; employee health and safety labeling or other notifications with respect to the content or other aspects of our processes, products or packaging; restrictions on the use of certain materials in or on design aspects of our products or product packaging; and, responsibility for disposal of products or product packaging. Discussions and proposals related to gas emissions and climate change have increasingly become the subject of substantial attention; additional regulation in this area could have the effect of restricting our business operations or increasing our operating costs.  More stringent environmental regulations may be enacted in the future, and we cannot presently determine the modifications, if any, in our operations that any such future regulations might require, or the cost of compliance with these regulations.  GENERAL RISKS The global nature of our operations exposes us to numerous risks that could materially adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations.  We operate in 15 countries, and our products are distributed in those countries as well as in other parts of the world. A large portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside of the United States and a large portion of our sales are generated outside of the United States. Operations outside of the United States, particularly operations in developing regions, are subject to various risks that may not be present or as significant for our U.S. operations. Economic uncertainty in some of the geographic regions in which we operate, including developing regions, could result in the disruption of commerce and negatively impact cash flows from our operations in those areas. Risks inherent in our international operations include:   ●  COVID-19-related closures and other pandemic-related uncertainties in the countries in which we operate;   ●  Import and export regulations that could erode profit margins or restrict exports;   ●  Foreign exchange controls and tax rates;   ●  Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, including devaluations;   ●  Changes in regional and local economic conditions, including local inflationary pressures;   ●  Difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems;   ●  Variations in protection of intellectual property and other legal rights;   ●  More expansive legal rights of foreign unions or works councils;   ●  Changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;   ●  Inability or regulatory limitations on our ability to move goods across borders;   ●  Changes in laws and regulations, including the laws and policies of the United States affecting trade, tariffs and foreign investment;   ●  Restrictive governmental actions such as those on transfer or repatriation of funds and trade protection matters, including antidumping duties, tariffs, trade wars, embargoes and prohibitions or restrictions on acquisitions or joint ventures;   ●  Social plans that prohibit or increase the cost of certain restructuring actions;   ●  The uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effects of Brexit;   ●  The potential for nationalization of enterprises or facilities; and   ●  Unsettled political conditions and possible terrorist attacks against U.S. or other interests.  As a multi-national company, we are faced with increased complexities due to recent changes to the U.S. corporate tax code relating to our unremitted foreign earnings, potential revisions to international tax law treaties, and renegotiated trade deals.  In addition, other events, such as the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union and the ongoing discussion and negotiations concerning varying levels of tariffs on product imported from the PRC, also create a level of uncertainty.  If we are unable to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks, it could have a material and adverse effect on our business, our consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition.       13   Table of Contents Cyber risk and the failure to maintain the integrity of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties with which we do business, could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Our Company expects to continue to experience cyber threats from time to time, which pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers, or cyber-attacks or security breaches of our networks or systems, could result in the loss of customers and business opportunities, legal liability, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, other litigation, regulatory and legal risks and the costs associated therewith, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, remediation costs, increased cybersecurity protection costs, additional compliance costs, increased insurance premiums, and lost revenues, damage to the Company's competitiveness, stock price, and long-term shareholder value, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we attempt to mitigate these risks, our systems, networks, products, solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced and persistent threats. We also maintain and have access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws and regulations. Despite our efforts to protect such sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, our facilities and systems and those of our customers and third-party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches, theft, fraud, misplaced or lost data, “Acts of God”, programming and/or human errors that could lead to the compromising of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, improper use of our systems, software solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations. A loss of the services of the Company's executive officers or other skilled associates could negatively impact our operations and results. The success of the Company's operations is largely dependent upon the performance of its executive officers, managers, engineers and salespeople.  Many of these individuals have a significant number of years of experience within the Company and/or the industry in which we compete and would be extremely difficult to replace.  The loss of the services of any of these associates may materially and adversely impact our results of operations if we are unable to replace them in a timely manner.   "

 The risks described below should be carefully considered before making an investment decision. These are the risk factors that we consider to be the most significant risk factors, but they are not the only risk factors that should be considered in making an investment decision. This Form 10-K also contains Forward-Looking Statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See the ""Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Information,"" above. Our business, consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of the risk factors described below, under ""Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Information"" or with respect to specific Forward-Looking Statements presented herein. The trading price of our securities could decline due to any of these risks, and investors in our securities may lose all or part of their investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business in the future. We conduct business in a highly competitive industry. Our business is largely in a highly competitive worldwide industry, with relatively low barriers to competitive entry. We compete principally on the basis of product performance, quality, reliability, depth of product line, customer service, technological innovation, design, delivery time and price. The industry in which we operate has become increasingly concentrated and globalized in recent years and our major competitors, some of which are larger than Bel, have significant financial resources and technological capabilities. Our global operations and demand for our products face risks related to health epidemics such as the coronavirus.  Any outbreaks of contagious diseases and other adverse public health developments in countries where we operate could have a material and adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations. In January 2020, the recent outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus was first identified and had an unfavorable impact on our four largest manufacturing facilities, which are located in China, throughout the first quarter of 2020.  Travel restrictions imposed by the local governmental authorities to control the spread of the virus resulted in an extended closure of our facilities in China over the Lunar New Year holiday, with the return of workers delayed until following the holiday break.  By March 9, 2020, our overall worker return rate at our China facilities was approximately 85%.  Our suppliers, customers and our customers’ contract manufacturers have been similarly impacted, and many are also currently operating at less than full capacity.  As the coronavirus continues to spread across Europe and the U.S., additional Bel facilities may be negatively impacted.  In addition, the coronavirus has started to adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our end customers’ products. The extent to which the coronavirus will impact our business and our consolidated financial results will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at the time of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful. Our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to effect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our credit agreement restricts our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due. In addition, we conduct a substantial portion of our operations through our subsidiaries, certain of which are not guarantors of our indebtedness. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Unless they are guarantors of our indebtedness, our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity, and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. In the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations. If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default, the lenders under the credit agreement could terminate their commitments to loan money, the lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. 6Table of Contents Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly. Borrowings under our credit facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net earnings and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. Further, a portion of our interest rate in effect is determined each quarter by our leverage ratio in relation to a tiered pricing grid, as outlined in the credit agreement. An increase in our leverage ratio would result in higher borrowing costs. As of December 31, 2019, we had $145.0 million of borrowings under our credit facility at a variable interest rate. A 1% increase or decrease in the assumed interest rates on the senior secured credit facilities would result in a $1.4 million increase or decrease in annual interest expense. Our high level of indebtedness could negatively impact our access to the capital markets and our ability to satisfy financial covenants under our existing credit agreement. We incurred substantial amounts of indebtedness to fund the acquisitions of Power Solutions and Connectivity Solutions in 2014, and we may need to incur additional indebtedness to finance operations or for other general corporate purposes.  Our consolidated principal amount of outstanding indebtedness was $145.0 million at December 31, 2019, resulting in a leverage ratio of 3.14x adjusted EBITDA, as calculated in accordance with our credit agreement.  Accordingly, our U.S. debt service requirements are significant in relation to our U.S. net sales and cash flow.  This leverage exposes us to risk in the event of downturns in our business, in our industry or in the economy generally, and may impair our operating flexibility and our ability to compete effectively.  Our current credit agreement requires us to maintain a certain covenant leverage ratio, and the ratio becomes more restrictive at specific dates during the term.  If we do not continue to satisfy this required ratio or receive waivers from our lenders, we will be in default under the credit agreement, which could result in an accelerated maturity of our debt obligations. Our backlog figures may not be reliable indicators. Many of the orders that comprise our backlog may be delayed, accelerated or canceled by customers without penalty. Customers may on occasion double order from multiple sources to ensure timely delivery when lead times are particularly long. Customers often cancel orders when business is weak and inventories are excessive.  Therefore, we cannot be certain that the amount of our backlog equals or exceeds the level of orders that will ultimately be delivered. Our results of operations could be adversely impacted if customers cancel a material portion of orders in our backlog. There are several factors which can cause us to lower our prices or otherwise cause our margins to suffer. Our prices and/or margins could be substantially impacted by the following factors: a)  The average selling prices for our products tend to decrease over their life cycles, and customers put pressure on suppliers to lower prices even when production costs are increasing. Our profits suffer if we are not able to reduce our costs of production, introduce technological innovations as sales prices decline, or pass through cost increases to customers. b)  Any drop in demand for our products or increase in supply of competitive products could cause a dramatic drop in our average sales prices which in turn could result in a decrease in our gross margins.  A shift in product mix could also have an unfavorable or favorable impact on our gross margins, depending upon the underlying raw material content and labor requirements of the associated products. c)  Increased competition from low cost suppliers around the world has put further pressures on pricing.  We continually strive to lower our costs, negotiate better pricing for components and raw materials and improve our operating efficiencies.  Profit margins will be materially and adversely impacted if we are not able to reduce our costs of production or introduce technological innovations when sales prices decline. Our annual effective income tax rate can change materially as a result of changes in our mix of U.S. and foreign earnings and other factors, including changes in tax laws and changes made by regulatory authorities. Our overall effective income tax rate is equal to our total tax expense as a percentage of total earnings before tax. However, income tax expense and benefits are not recognized on a global basis but rather on a jurisdictional or legal entity basis. Losses in one jurisdiction may not be used to offset profits in other jurisdictions and may cause an increase in our tax rate. Changes in statutory tax rates and laws, as well as ongoing audits by domestic and international authorities, could affect the amount of income taxes and other taxes paid by us. Also, changes in the mix of earnings (or losses) between jurisdictions and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes, among other factors, could have a significant effect on our overall effective income tax rate. In addition, our effective tax rate would increase if we were unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions, or if we were otherwise required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets. We are subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions. As a result, any adverse development in the tax laws of any of these jurisdictions or any disagreement with our tax positions could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of operations. We are subject to taxation in, and to the tax laws and regulations of, multiple jurisdictions as a result of the international scope of our operations and our corporate and financing structure. We are also subject to transfer pricing laws with respect to our intercompany transactions, including those relating to the flow of funds among our companies. Adverse developments in these laws or regulations, or any change in position regarding the application, administration or interpretation thereof, in any applicable jurisdiction, could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of our operations. In addition, the tax authorities in any applicable jurisdiction, including the United States, may disagree with the positions we have taken or intend to take regarding the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions. If any applicable tax authorities, including U.S. tax authorities, were to successfully challenge the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of our operations. 7Table of Contents Our business may be materially affected by changes to fiscal and tax policies. Negative or unexpected tax consequences could materially adversely affect our results of operations. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the ""Tax Act"") which included significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system. The effect of the international provisions of the Tax Act resulted in a one-time deemed repatriation tax on unremitted foreign earnings and profits (a ""transition tax"").  At December 31, 2017, we had made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax in connection with which we recognized a provisional amount of $18.1 million, which was included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations.  On the basis of revised computations that were completed during the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recognized a measurement-period adjustment reducing the deemed repatriation tax by $2.6 million, resulting in a reduction of the Company's provisional estimate from $18.1 million to $15.5 million.  Any further changes to fiscal and tax policies could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of operations. In the PRC, we are challenged to match availability of workers and maintain lead times in line with customer demand for certain of our products, which demand has been highly volatile in recent years.  This volatility can materially adversely affect Bel's results. In the PRC, the availability of labor is cyclical and is significantly affected by the migration of workers in relation to the annual Lunar New Year holiday as well as economic conditions in the PRC and current concerns regarding responses to the outbreak of the coronavirus.  In addition, we have little visibility into the ordering habits of our customers and can be subjected to large and unpredictable variations in demand for our products.  Accordingly, we must continually recruit and train new workers to replace those lost to attrition each year and to address peaks in demand that may occur from time to time.  These recruiting and training efforts and related inefficiencies, as well as overtime required in order to meet demand, can add volatility to the costs incurred by the Company for labor in the PRC. Increases in minimum wage rates in the PRC and Mexico will have an unfavorable impact on our profit margins. Approximately one-third of our total sales are generated from labor intensive magnetic products, which are primarily manufactured in the PRC.  Minimum wage rates in the PRC, which are mandated by the government, were increased in early- and mid-2018 in each of the regions in which Bel's products are manufactured.  In addition, the government in Mexico issued increases to the minimum wage rates effective January 1, 2019 which impacted our labor rates at both of our manufacturing facilities in Mexico.  These and any future increases in minimum wage rates will have an unfavorable impact on our profit margins. We are dependent on our ability to develop new products. Our future operating results are dependent, in part, on our ability to develop, produce and market new and more technologically advanced products. There are numerous risks inherent in this process, including the risks that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to timely develop and bring to market new products and applications to meet customers' changing needs. Our insurance policies may not cover all operating risks and a casualty loss beyond the limits of our coverage could adversely impact our business. Our business is subject to operating hazards and risks relating to handling, storing, transporting and use of the products we sell. We maintain insurance policies in amounts and with coverage and deductibles that we believe are reasonable and prudent. Nevertheless, our insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us from all liabilities and expenses that may arise from claims for personal injury or death or property damage arising in the ordinary course of business, and our current levels of insurance may not be maintained or available in the future at economical prices. If a significant liability claim is brought against us that is not adequately covered by insurance, we may have to pay the claim with our own funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of operations. Our acquisitions may not produce the anticipated results. A significant portion of our growth has been attributable to acquisitions. We cannot assure that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future. If an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our other businesses, our results of operations, enterprise value, market value and prospects could all be materially and adversely affected.  Integration of new acquisitions into our consolidated operations may result in lower average operating results for the group as a whole, and may divert management's focus from the ongoing operations of the Company during the integration period. Our strategy also focuses on the reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses through the integration or elimination of redundant sales facilities and administrative functions at acquired companies.  If we are unable to achieve our expectations with respect to our acquisitions, such inability could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations.  If the acquisitions fail to perform up to our expectations, or if there is further weakening of economic conditions, we could be required to record impairment charges.  During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded an impairment charge of $8.9 million due to weakened market conditions in our former North America operating segment. 8Table of Contents We may not achieve all of the expected benefits from our restructuring programs. We have implemented a number of restructuring programs in recent years and we may continue to restructure or rationalize our operations in future periods. These programs include various cost savings, the consolidation of certain facilities and the reduction of headcount. We make certain assumptions in estimating the anticipated savings we expect to achieve under such programs, which include the estimated savings from the elimination of certain headcount and the consolidation of facilities. These assumptions may turn out to be incorrect due to a variety of factors. In addition, our ability to realize the expected benefits from these programs is subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unsuccessful in implementing these programs or if we do not achieve our expected results, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected or our business operations could be disrupted. The global nature of our operations exposes us to numerous risks that could materially adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations. We operate in 15 countries, and our products are distributed in those countries as well as in other parts of the world. A large portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside of the United States and a large portion of our sales are generated outside of the United States. Operations outside of the United States, particularly operations in developing regions, are subject to various risks that may not be present or as significant for our U.S. operations. Economic uncertainty in some of the geographic regions in which we operate, including developing regions, could result in the disruption of commerce and negatively impact cash flows from our operations in those areas. Risks inherent in our international operations include: •foreign exchange controls and tax rates; •foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, including devaluations; •the potential for changes in regional and local economic conditions, including local inflationary pressures; •restrictive governmental actions such as those on transfer or repatriation of funds and trade protection matters, including antidumping duties, tariffs, trade wars, embargoes and prohibitions or restrictions on acquisitions or joint ventures; •changes in laws and regulations, including the laws and policies of the United States affecting trade, tariffs and foreign investment; •the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems; •variations in protection of intellectual property and other legal rights; •more expansive legal rights of foreign unions or works councils; •changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; •inability or regulatory limitations on our ability to move goods across borders;  •social plans that prohibit or increase the cost of certain restructuring actions; •the potential for nationalization of enterprises or facilities; and •unsettled political conditions and possible terrorist attacks against U.S. or other interests. As a multi-national company, we are faced with increased complexities due to recent changes to the U.S. corporate tax code relating to our unremitted foreign earnings, potential revisions to international tax law treaties, and renegotiated trade deals.  In addition, other events, such as the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union and the ongoing discussion and negotiations concerning varying levels of tariffs on product imported from the PRC, also create a level of uncertainty.  If we are unable to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks, it could have a material and adverse effect on our business, our consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial condition. 9Table of Contents   The loss of certain substantial customers could materially and adversely affect us. During the year ended December 31, 2019, sales to one direct customer exceeded 10% of our consolidated net sales. Hon Hai/Foxconn Technology Group, a contract manufacturer utilized by various end customers, represented 10.2% of our 2019 consolidated net sales. We believe that the loss of this customer could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations.  We have experienced significant concentrations in prior years. See Note 12, ""Segments"" for additional disclosures related to our significant customers.  Furthermore, factors that negatively impact the businesses of our major customers, such as the continued grounding of aircraft at a major commercial aerospace customer, could materially and adversely affect us even if the customer represents less than 10% of our 2019 consolidated net sales. We may experience labor unrest. As we periodically implement transfers of certain of our operations, we may experience strikes or other types of labor unrest as a result of lay-offs or termination of employees in higher labor cost countries.  Our manufacturing facilities in the United Kingdom and Mexico are represented by labor unions and substantially all of our factory workers in the PRC are represented by government-sponsored unions. We may experience labor shortages. Government, economic, social and labor policies in the PRC may cause shortages of factory labor in areas where we have some of our products manufactured.  If we are required to manufacture more of these products outside of the PRC as a result of such shortages, our margins will likely be materially adversely affected. There are risks related to the implementation of our new global enterprise resource planning system. We are currently engaged in a multi-year process of conforming the majority of our operations onto one global enterprise resource planning system (""ERP"").  The ERP is designed to improve the efficiency of our supply chain and financial transaction processes, accurately maintain our books and records, and provide information important to the operation of the business to our management team. The implementation of the ERP will continue to require significant investment of human and financial resources, and we may experience significant delays, increased costs and other difficulties as a result. Any significant disruption or deficiency in the design and implementation of the ERP could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fulfill and invoice customer orders, apply cash receipts, place purchase orders with suppliers, and make cash disbursements, and could negatively impact data processing and electronic communications among business locations, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of operations. We also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing necessary upgrades to those systems while we implement the new ERP system. While we have invested significant resources in planning and project management, significant implementation issues may arise. Expanding and evolving data privacy laws and regulations could impact our business and expose us to increased liability. Our business is subject to federal, state, local and foreign privacy laws, rules and regulations of multiple countries that we operate in, including but not limited to the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (“EU GDPR”) and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2020. The California Consumer Privacy Act (""CCPA"") that went into effect in January 2020 with many regulations that are similar to the EU GDPR. Under the Withdrawal Agreement (Brexit), EU GDPR will continue to apply to and in the United Kingdom during the Transition Period from January 31, 2020 until December 31, 2020. The EU GDPR imposes significant requirements on how we collect, process and transfer personal data, as well as significant financial penalties for non-compliance.  Any inability to adequately address privacy concerns, even if unfounded, or to comply with the more complex privacy or data protection laws, regulations and privacy standards, could lead to significant financial penalties, which may result in a material and adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations. Our results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted by environmental and other regulations. Our manufacturing operations, products and/or product packaging are subject to environmental laws and regulations governing air emissions; wastewater discharges; the handling, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances, wastes and certain chemicals used or generated in our manufacturing processes; employee health and safety labeling or other notifications with respect to the content or other aspects of our processes, products or packaging; restrictions on the use of certain materials in or on design aspects of our products or product packaging; and, responsibility for disposal of products or product packaging. More stringent environmental regulations may be enacted in the future, and we cannot presently determine the modifications, if any, in our operations that any such future regulations might require, or the cost of compliance with these regulations. 10Table of Contents We may face risks relating to climate change that could have an adverse impact on our business. Greenhouse gas (""GHG"") emissions have increasingly become the subject of substantial international, national, regional, state and local attention.  GHG emission regulations have been promulgated in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate, and additional GHG requirements are in various stages of development.  Such measures could require us to modify existing or obtain new permits, implement additional pollution control technology, curtail operations or increase our operating costs.  Any additional regulation of GHG emissions, including a cap-and-trade system, technology mandate, emissions tax, reporting requirement or other program, could materially adversely affect our business. Regulations related to conflict minerals will cause the Company to incur additional expenses and may have other adverse consequences. The SEC has adopted inquiry, diligence and additional disclosure requirements related to certain minerals sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and surrounding countries, or ""conflict minerals"", that are necessary to the functionality of a product manufactured, or contracted to be manufactured, by an SEC reporting company. The minerals that the rules cover are commonly referred to as ""3TG"" and include tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold. As a public company, Bel has been required to make filings under these rules since 2014.  In such annual filings, Bel describes the due diligence it has undertaken of its suppliers in an effort to determine the source of any conflict minerals used in its products or components.  These due diligence requirements are ongoing, and Bel will continue to incur additional costs, which could be substantial, related to its due diligence and compliance process.  In addition, the Company's supply chain is complex, and if it is not able to determine with certainty the source and chain of custody for all conflict minerals used in its products that are sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and surrounding countries, then the Company may face reputational challenges with customers, investors or others.  As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering ""conflict free"" minerals, if the Company chooses to use only conflict minerals that are ""conflict free"" in its products and components, the Company cannot be sure that it will be able to obtain necessary materials from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices.      Our results may vary substantially from period to period. Our revenues and expenses may vary significantly from one accounting period to another accounting period due to a variety of factors, including customers' buying decisions, our product mix, the volatility of raw material costs, the impact of competition, the impact of the Chinese New Year and general market and economic conditions.  Such variations could significantly impact our stock price. A shortage of availability or an increase in the cost of high-quality raw materials, components and other resources may adversely impact our ability to procure these items at cost effective prices and thus may negatively impact profit margins. Our results of operations may be materially adversely impacted by difficulties in obtaining raw materials, supplies, power, labor, natural resources and any other items needed for the production of our products, as well as by the effects of quality deviations in raw materials and the effects of significant fluctuations in the prices of existing inventories and purchase commitments for these materials.  Many of these materials and components are produced by a limited number of suppliers and their availability to us may be constrained by supplier capacity.  See ""Key Factors Affecting our Business"" in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of how pricing and availability of materials is currently impacting our business. Rapid shifts in demand for various products may cause some of our inventory of raw materials, components or finished goods to become obsolete. The life cycles and demand for our products are directly linked to the life cycles and demand for the end products into which they are designed.  Rapid shifts in the life cycles or demand for these end products due to technological shifts, economic conditions or other market trends may result in material amounts of either raw materials or finished goods inventory becoming obsolete.   While the Company works diligently to manage inventory levels, rapid shifts in demand may result in obsolete or excess inventory and materially adversely impact financial results. A loss of the services of the Company's executive officers or other skilled associates could negatively impact our operations and results. The success of the Company's operations is largely dependent upon the performance of its executive officers, managers, engineers and sales people.  Many of these individuals have a significant number of years of experience within the Company and/or the industry in which we compete and would be extremely difficult to replace.  The loss of the services of any of these associates may materially and adversely impact our results of operations if we are unable to replace them in a timely manner. 11Table of Contents Our stock price, like that of many technology companies, has been and may continue to be volatile. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate as a result of variations in our quarterly operating results and other factors beyond our control.  These fluctuations may be exaggerated if the trading volume of our common stock is low.  The market price of our common stock may rise and fall in response to a variety of other factors, including: •announcements of technological or competitive developments;•general market or economic conditions;•the impact of the coronavirus on our operations and supply chain;•market or economic conditions specific to particular geographical areas in which we operate;•acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or our competitors;•the gain or loss of a significant customer or order; or•changes in estimates of our financial performance or changes in recommendations by securities analysts regarding us or our industry In addition, equity securities of many technology companies have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations even in periods when the capital markets generally are not distressed.  These price and volume fluctuations often have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies. Our intellectual property rights may not be adequately protected under the current state of the law. Our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights through patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and in other countries may not prevent misappropriation, and our failure to protect our proprietary rights could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and future prospects. A third party could, without authorization, copy or otherwise appropriate our proprietary information. Our agreements with employees and others who participate in development activities could be breached, we may not have adequate remedies for any breach, and our trade secrets may otherwise become known or independently developed by competitors. We may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights and we may incur defense costs and possibly royalty obligations or lose the right to use technology important to our business. From time to time, we receive claims by third parties asserting that our products violate their intellectual property rights.  Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be time consuming and expensive to litigate or settle and could divert management attention from administering our business.  A third party asserting infringement claims against us or our customers with respect to our current or future products may materially and adversely affect us by, for example, causing us to enter into costly royalty arrangements or forcing us to incur settlement or litigation costs. As a result of protective provisions in the Company's certificate of incorporation, the voting power of certain officers, directors and principal shareholders may be increased at future meetings of the Company's shareholders. The Company's certificate of incorporation provides that if a shareholder, other than shareholders subject to specific exceptions, acquires (after the date of the Company's 1998 recapitalization) 10% or more of the outstanding Class A common stock and does not own an equal or greater percentage of all then outstanding shares of both Class A and Class B common stock (all of which common stock must have been acquired after the date of the 1998 recapitalization), such shareholder must, within 90 days of the trigger date, purchase Class B common shares, in an amount and at a price determined in accordance with a formula described in the Company's certificate of incorporation, or forfeit its right to vote its Class A common shares. As of February 29, 2020, to the Company's knowledge, there was one shareholder of the Company's common stock with ownership in excess of 10% of Class A outstanding shares with no ownership of the Company's Class B common stock and with no basis for exception from the operation of the above-mentioned provisions. In order to vote its shares at Bel's next shareholders' meeting, this shareholder must either purchase the required number of Class B common shares or sell or otherwise transfer Class A common shares until its Class A holdings are under 10%. As of February 29, 2020, to the Company's knowledge, this shareholder owned 21.5% of the Company's Class A common stock and had not taken steps to either purchase the required number of Class B common shares or sell or otherwise transfer Class A common shares until its Class A holdings fall below 10%.  Unless and until this situation is satisfied in a manner permitted by the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the subject shareholder will not be permitted to vote its shares of common stock. To the extent that the voting rights of particular holders of Class A common stock are suspended as of times when the Company's shareholders vote due to the above-mentioned provisions, such suspension will have the effect of increasing the voting power of those holders of Class A common shares whose voting rights are not suspended.  As of February 29, 2020, Daniel Bernstein, the Company's chief executive officer, beneficially owned 354,906 Class A common shares (or 21.0%) of the outstanding Class A common shares whose voting rights were not suspended, and all directors and current executive officers as a group (which includes Daniel Bernstein) beneficially owned 362,930 Class A common shares (or 21.4%) of the outstanding Class A common shares whose voting rights were not suspended. 12Table of Contents Cyber risk and the failure to maintain the integrity of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties with which we do business, could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations. We are subject to an increasing number of various types of information technology vulnerabilities, threats and targeted computer crimes which pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers, or cyber-attacks or security breaches of our networks or systems, could result in the loss of customers and business opportunities, legal liability, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, other litigation, regulatory and legal risks and the costs associated therewith, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, remediation costs, increased cybersecurity protection costs, additional compliance costs, increased insurance premiums, and lost revenues, damage to the Company's competitiveness, stock price, and long-term shareholder value, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we attempt to mitigate these risks, our systems, networks, products, solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced and persistent threats. We also maintain and have access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer controls. Despite our efforts to protect such sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, our facilities and systems and those of our customers and third-party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches, theft, fraud, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors that could lead to the compromising of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, improper use of our systems, software solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and consolidated results of operations. As a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to a number of procurement rules and regulations. We must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the award, administration, and performance of U.S. Government contracts. Government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and, in some instances, impose added costs on our business. A violation of specific laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties or the termination of our contracts or debarment from bidding on contracts. These fines and penalties could be imposed for failing to follow procurement integrity and bidding rules, employing improper billing practices or otherwise failing to follow cost accounting standards, receiving or paying kickbacks, or filing false claims. We have been, and expect to continue to be, subjected to audits and investigations by government agencies. The failure to comply with the terms of our government contracts could harm our business reputation. It could also result in our progress payments being withheld. In some instances, these laws and regulations impose terms or rights that are more favorable to the government than those typically available to commercial parties in negotiated transactions. For example, the U.S. Government may terminate any of our government contracts and, in general, subcontracts, at its convenience as well as for default based on performance. Upon termination for convenience of a fixed-price type contract, we normally are entitled to receive the purchase price for delivered items, reimbursement for allowable costs for work-in-process, and an allowance for profit on work actually completed on the contract or adjustment for loss if completion of performance would have resulted in a loss. Upon termination for convenience of a Federal Government cost reimbursement contract, we normally are entitled to reimbursement of allowable costs plus a portion of the fee. Such allowable costs would normally include our cost to terminate agreements with our suppliers and subcontractors. The amount of the fee recovered, if any, is related to the portion of the work accomplished prior to termination and is determined by negotiation. "
12,BELFB,BEL FUSE INC,2019-03-08,"  Risk Factors
The risks described below should be carefully considered before making an investment decision. These are the risk factors that we consider to be the most significant risk factors, but they are not the only risk factors that should be considered in making an investment decision. This Form 10-K also contains Forward-Looking Statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See the ""Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Information,"" above. Our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of the risk factors described below, under ""Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Information"" or with respect to specific Forward-Looking Statements presented herein. The trading price of our securities could decline due to any of these risks, and investors in our securities may lose all or part of their investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business in the future.We conduct business in a highly competitive industry.Our business is largely in a highly competitive worldwide industry, with relatively low barriers to competitive entry. We compete principally on the basis of product performance, quality, reliability, depth of product line, customer service, technological innovation, design, delivery time and price. The industry in which we operate has become increasingly concentrated and globalized in recent years and our major competitors, some of which are larger than Bel, have significant financial resources and technological capabilities.We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.Our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to effect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our credit agreement restricts our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due.In addition, we conduct a substantial portion of our operations through our subsidiaries, certain of which are not guarantors of our indebtedness. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Unless they are guarantors of our indebtedness, our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity, and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. In the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness.Our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations.If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default, the lenders under the credit agreement could terminate their commitments to loan money, the lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. 6Return to IndexOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.Borrowings under our credit facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net earnings and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. As of December 31, 2018, we had $116.0 million of borrowings under our credit facility at a variable interest rate. A 1% increase or decrease in the assumed interest rates on the senior secured credit facilities would result in a $1.1 million increase or decrease in annual interest expense.Our high level of indebtedness could negatively impact our access to the capital markets and our ability to satisfy financial covenants under our existing credit agreement.We incurred substantial amounts of indebtedness to fund the acquisitions of Power Solutions and Connectivity Solutions in 2014, and we may need to incur additional indebtedness to finance operations or for other general corporate purposes.  Our consolidated principal amount of outstanding indebtedness was $116.0 million at December 31, 2018, resulting in a leverage ratio of 2.18x adjusted EBITDA, as calculated in accordance with our credit agreement.  Accordingly, our U.S. debt service requirements are significant in relation to our U.S. net sales and cash flow.  This leverage exposes us to risk in the event of downturns in our business, in our industry or in the economy generally, and may impair our operating flexibility and our ability to compete effectively.  Our current credit agreement requires us to maintain a certain covenant leverage ratio, and the ratio becomes more restrictive at specific dates during the term.  If we do not continue to satisfy this required ratio or receive waivers from our lenders, we will be in default under the credit agreement, which could result in an accelerated maturity of our debt obligations.Our backlog figures may not be reliable indicators.Many of the orders that comprise our backlog may be delayed, accelerated or canceled by customers without penalty. Customers may on occasion double order from multiple sources to ensure timely delivery when lead times are particularly long. Customers often cancel orders when business is weak and inventories are excessive.  Therefore, we cannot be certain that the amount of our backlog equals or exceeds the level of orders that will ultimately be delivered. Our results of operations could be adversely impacted if customers cancel a material portion of orders in our backlog.There are several factors which can cause us to lower our prices or otherwise cause our margins to suffer.Our prices and/or margins could be substantially impacted by the following factors:a)  The average selling prices for our products tend to decrease over their life cycles, and customers put pressure on suppliers to lower prices even when production costs are increasing. Our profits suffer if we are not able to reduce our costs of production, introduce technological innovations as sales prices decline, or pass through cost increases to customers.b)  Any drop in demand for our products or increase in supply of competitive products could cause a dramatic drop in our average sales prices which in turn could result in a decrease in our gross margins.  A shift in product mix could also have an unfavorable or favorable impact on our gross margins, depending upon the underlying raw material content and labor requirements of the associated products.c)  Increased competition from low cost suppliers around the world has put further pressures on pricing.  We continually strive to lower our costs, negotiate better pricing for components and raw materials and improve our operating efficiencies.  Profit margins will be materially and adversely impacted if we are not able to reduce our costs of production or introduce technological innovations when sales prices decline.Our annual effective income tax rate can change materially as a result of changes in our mix of U.S. and foreign earnings and other factors, including changes in tax laws and changes made by regulatory authorities.Our overall effective income tax rate is equal to our total tax expense as a percentage of total earnings before tax. However, income tax expense and benefits are not recognized on a global basis but rather on a jurisdictional or legal entity basis. Losses in one jurisdiction may not be used to offset profits in other jurisdictions and may cause an increase in our tax rate. Changes in statutory tax rates and laws, as well as ongoing audits by domestic and international authorities, could affect the amount of income taxes and other taxes paid by us. Also, changes in the mix of earnings (or losses) between jurisdictions and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes, among other factors, could have a significant effect on our overall effective income tax rate. In addition, our effective tax rate would increase if we were unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions, or if we were otherwise required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets. 7Return to IndexWe are subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions. As a result, any adverse development in the tax laws of any of these jurisdictions or any disagreement with our tax positions could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations.We are subject to taxation in, and to the tax laws and regulations of, multiple jurisdictions as a result of the international scope of our operations and our corporate and financing structure. We are also subject to transfer pricing laws with respect to our intercompany transactions, including those relating to the flow of funds among our companies. Adverse developments in these laws or regulations, or any change in position regarding the application, administration or interpretation thereof, in any applicable jurisdiction, could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or results of our operations. In addition, the tax authorities in any applicable jurisdiction, including the United States, may disagree with the positions we have taken or intend to take regarding the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions. If any applicable tax authorities, including U.S. tax authorities, were to successfully challenge the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of our operations.Our business may be materially affected by changes to fiscal and tax policies. Negative or unexpected tax consequences could materially adversely affect our results of operations.On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the ""Tax Act"") which includes significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system. The effect of the international provisions of the Tax Act resulted in a one-time deemed repatriation tax on unremitted foreign earnings and profits (a ""transition tax"").  At December 31, 2017, we had made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax in connection with which we recognized a provisional amount of $18.1 million, which was included as a component of income tax expense from continuing operations.  On the basis of revised computations that were completed during the year ended December 31, 2018, the Company recognized a measurement-period adjustment reducing the deemed repatriation tax by $2.6 million, resulting in a reduction of the Company's provisional estimate from $18.1 million to $15.5 million.  Any further changes to fiscal and tax policies could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of operations.In the PRC, we are challenged to match availability of workers and maintain lead times in line with customer demand for certain of our products, which demand has been highly volatile in recent years.  This volatility can materially adversely affect Bel's results.In the PRC, the availability of labor is cyclical and is significantly affected by the migration of workers in relation to the annual Lunar New Year holiday as well as economic conditions in the PRC.  In addition, we have little visibility into the ordering habits of our customers and can be subjected to large and unpredictable variations in demand for our products.  Accordingly, we must continually recruit and train new workers to replace those lost to attrition each year and to address peaks in demand that may occur from time to time.  These recruiting and training efforts and related inefficiencies, as well as overtime required in order to meet demand, can add volatility to the costs incurred by the Company for labor in the PRC.Increases in minimum wage rates in the PRC and Mexico will have an unfavorable impact on our profit margins.Approximately one-third of our total sales are generated from labor intensive magnetic products, which are primarily manufactured in the PRC.  Minimum wage rates in the PRC, which are mandated by the government, were increased in 2018 in each of the regions in which Bel's products are manufactured.  This was the primary driver of higher labor costs in 2018 at 11.5% of sales as compared to 10.8% of sales in 2017.  In addition, the government in Mexico issued increases to the minimum wage rates effective January 1, 2019 which will impact our labor rates at both of our manufacturing facilities in Mexico.  We anticipate the higher wage rates in Mexico will result in approximately $0.4 million of incremental labor costs in 2019.  These and any future increases in minimum wage rates will have an unfavorable impact on our profit margins.We are dependent on our ability to develop new products.Our future operating results are dependent, in part, on our ability to develop, produce and market new and more technologically advanced products. There are numerous risks inherent in this process, including the risks that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to timely develop and bring to market new products and applications to meet customers' changing needs.Our insurance policies may not cover all operating risks and a casualty loss beyond the limits of our coverage could adversely impact our business.Our business is subject to operating hazards and risks relating to handling, storing, transporting and use of the products we sell. We maintain insurance policies in amounts and with coverage and deductibles that we believe are reasonable and prudent. Nevertheless, our insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us from all liabilities and expenses that may arise from claims for personal injury or death or property damage arising in the ordinary course of business, and our current levels of insurance may not be maintained or available in the future at economical prices. If a significant liability claim is brought against us that is not adequately covered by insurance, we may have to pay the claim with our own funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations.8Return to IndexOur acquisitions may not produce the anticipated results.A significant portion of our growth has been attributable to acquisitions. We cannot assure that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future. If an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our other businesses, our results of operations, enterprise value, market value and prospects could all be materially and adversely affected.  Integration of new acquisitions into our consolidated operations may result in lower average operating results for the group as a whole, and may divert management's focus from the ongoing operations of the Company during the integration period.Our strategy also focuses on the reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses through the integration or elimination of redundant sales facilities and administrative functions at acquired companies.  If we are unable to achieve our expectations with respect to our acquisitions, such inability could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations.  If the acquisitions fail to perform up to our expectations, or if there is further weakening of economic conditions, we could be required to record impairment charges.We may not achieve all of the expected benefits from our restructuring programs.We have implemented a number of restructuring programs in recent years and we may continue to restructure or rationalize our operations in future periods. These programs include various cost savings, the consolidation of certain facilities and the reduction of headcount. We make certain assumptions in estimating the anticipated savings we expect to achieve under such programs, which include the estimated savings from the elimination of certain headcount and the consolidation of facilities. These assumptions may turn out to be incorrect due to a variety of factors. In addition, our ability to realize the expected benefits from these programs is subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unsuccessful in implementing these programs or if we do not achieve our expected results, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected or our business operations could be disrupted.The global nature of our operations exposes us to numerous risks that could materially adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.We operate in 15 countries, and our products are distributed in those countries as well as in other parts of the world. A large portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside of the United States and a large portion of our sales are generated outside of the United States. Operations outside of the United States, particularly operations in developing regions, are subject to various risks that may not be present or as significant for our U.S. operations. Economic uncertainty in some of the geographic regions in which we operate, including developing regions, could result in the disruption of commerce and negatively impact cash flows from our operations in those areas.Risks inherent in our international operations include: • foreign exchange controls and tax rates; • foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, including devaluations; • the potential for changes in regional and local economic conditions, including local inflationary pressures; • restrictive governmental actions such as those on transfer or repatriation of funds and trade protection matters, including antidumping duties, tariffs, embargoes and prohibitions or restrictions on acquisitions or joint ventures; • changes in laws and regulations, including the laws and policies of the United States affecting trade, tariffs and foreign investment; • the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems; • variations in protection of intellectual property and other legal rights; • more expansive legal rights of foreign unions or works councils; • changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; • inability or regulatory limitations on our ability to move goods across borders;   • social plans that prohibit or increase the cost of certain restructuring actions; • the potential for nationalization of enterprises or facilities; and • unsettled political conditions and possible terrorist attacks against U.S. or other interests.9Return to IndexAs a multi-national company, we are faced with increased complexities due to recent changes to the U.S. corporate tax code relating to our unremitted foreign earnings, potential revisions to international tax law treaties, and renegotiated trade deals.  In addition, other events, such as the United Kingdom's continued efforts to exit the European Union and the ongoing discussion and negotiations concerning varying levels of tariffs on product imported from the PRC, also create a level of uncertainty.  If we are unable to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks, it could have a material and adverse effect on our business and our results of operations and financial condition.The loss of certain substantial customers could materially and adversely affect us.During the year ended December 31, 2018, sales to one direct customer exceeded 10% of our consolidated net sales. Hon Hai Precision Industry Company Ltd., a contract manufacturer utilized by various end customers, represented 12.3% of our 2018 consolidated net sales. We believe that the loss of this customer could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations.  We have experienced significant concentrations in prior years. See Note 12, ""Segments"" for additional disclosures related to our significant customers.We may experience labor unrest.As we periodically implement transfers of certain of our operations, we may experience strikes or other types of labor unrest as a result of lay-offs or termination of employees in higher labor cost countries.  Our manufacturing facilities in New York State, the United Kingdom and Mexico are represented by labor unions and substantially all of our factory workers in the PRC are represented by government-sponsored unions.We may experience labor shortages.Government, economic, social and labor policies in the PRC may cause shortages of factory labor in areas where we have some of our products manufactured.  If we are required to manufacture more of these products outside of the PRC as a result of such shortages, our margins will likely be materially adversely affected.There are risks related to the implementation of our new global enterprise resource planning system.We are currently engaged in a multi-year process of conforming the majority of our operations onto one global enterprise resource planning system (""ERP"").  The ERP is designed to improve the efficiency of our supply chain and financial transaction processes, accurately maintain our books and records, and provide information important to the operation of the business to our management team. The implementation of the ERP will continue to require significant investment of human and financial resources, and we may experience significant delays, increased costs and other difficulties as a result. Any significant disruption or deficiency in the design and implementation of the ERP could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fulfill and invoice customer orders, apply cash receipts, place purchase orders with suppliers, and make cash disbursements, and could negatively impact data processing and electronic communications among business locations, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations. We also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing necessary upgrades to those systems while we implement the new ERP system. While we have invested significant resources in planning and project management, significant implementation issues may arise.Expanding and evolving data privacy laws and regulations could impact our business and expose us to increased liability.The General Data Protection Regulation (""GDPR""), which became effective in the European Union in May 2018, imposes significant new requirements on how we collect, process and transfer personal data, as well as significant financial penalties for non-compliance.  Any inability to adequately address privacy concerns, even if unfounded, or to comply with the more complex privacy or data protection laws, regulations and privacy standards, could lead to significant financial penalties, which may result in a material and adverse effect on our results of operations.Our results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted by environmental and other regulations.Our manufacturing operations, products and/or product packaging are subject to environmental laws and regulations governing air emissions; wastewater discharges; the handling, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances, wastes and certain chemicals used or generated in our manufacturing processes; employee health and safety labeling or other notifications with respect to the content or other aspects of our processes, products or packaging; restrictions on the use of certain materials in or on design aspects of our products or product packaging; and, responsibility for disposal of products or product packaging. More stringent environmental regulations may be enacted in the future, and we cannot presently determine the modifications, if any, in our operations that any such future regulations might require, or the cost of compliance with these regulations. 10Return to IndexWe may face risks relating to climate change that could have an adverse impact on our business.Greenhouse gas (""GHG"") emissions have increasingly become the subject of substantial international, national, regional, state and local attention.  GHG emission regulations have been promulgated in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate, and additional GHG requirements are in various stages of development.  Such measures could require us to modify existing or obtain new permits, implement additional pollution control technology, curtail operations or increase our operating costs.  Any additional regulation of GHG emissions, including a cap-and-trade system, technology mandate, emissions tax, reporting requirement or other program, could materially adversely affect our business. Regulations related to conflict minerals will cause the Company to incur additional expenses and may have other adverse consequences.The SEC has adopted inquiry, diligence and additional disclosure requirements related to certain minerals sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and surrounding countries, or ""conflict minerals"", that are necessary to the functionality of a product manufactured, or contracted to be manufactured, by an SEC reporting company. The minerals that the rules cover are commonly referred to as ""3TG"" and include tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold. As a public company, Bel was required to make its first annual filing under these new rules on May 31, 2014.  In such annual filings, Bel describes the due diligence it has undertaken of its suppliers in an effort to determine the source of any conflict minerals used in its products or components.  These due diligence requirements are ongoing, and Bel will continue to incur additional costs, which could be substantial, related to its due diligence and compliance process.  In addition, the Company's supply chain is complex, and if it is not able to determine with certainty the source and chain of custody for all conflict minerals used in its products that are sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and surrounding countries, then the Company may face reputational challenges with customers, investors or others.  As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering ""conflict free"" minerals, if the Company chooses to use only conflict minerals that are ""conflict free"" in its products and components, the Company cannot be sure that it will be able to obtain necessary materials from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices.     Our results may vary substantially from period to period.Our revenues and expenses may vary significantly from one accounting period to another accounting period due to a variety of factors, including customers' buying decisions, our product mix, the volatility of raw material costs, the impact of competition, the impact of the Chinese New Year and general market and economic conditions.  Such variations could significantly impact our stock price.A shortage of availability or an increase in the cost of high-quality raw materials, components and other resources may adversely impact our ability to procure these items at cost effective prices and thus may negatively impact profit margins.Our results of operations may be materially adversely impacted by difficulties in obtaining raw materials, supplies, power, labor, natural resources and any other items needed for the production of our products, as well as by the effects of quality deviations in raw materials and the effects of significant fluctuations in the prices of existing inventories and purchase commitments for these materials.  Many of these materials and components are produced by a limited number of suppliers and their availability to us may be constrained by supplier capacity.  See ""Key Factors Affecting our Business"" in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of how pricing and availability of materials is currently impacting our business.Rapid shifts in demand for various products may cause some of our inventory of raw materials, components or finished goods to become obsolete.The life cycles and demand for our products are directly linked to the life cycles and demand for the end products into which they are designed.  Rapid shifts in the life cycles or demand for these end products due to technological shifts, economic conditions or other market trends may result in material amounts of either raw materials or finished goods inventory becoming obsolete.   While the Company works diligently to manage inventory levels, rapid shifts in demand may result in obsolete or excess inventory and materially adversely impact financial results.A loss of the services of the Company's executive officers or other skilled associates could negatively impact our operations and results.The success of the Company's operations is largely dependent upon the performance of its executive officers, managers, engineers and sales people.  Many of these individuals have a significant number of years of experience within the Company and/or the industry in which we compete and would be extremely difficult to replace.  The loss of the services of any of these associates may materially and adversely impact our results of operations if we are unable to replace them in a timely manner.11Return to IndexOur stock price, like that of many technology companies, has been and may continue to be volatile.The market price of our common stock may fluctuate as a result of variations in our quarterly operating results and other factors beyond our control.  These fluctuations may be exaggerated if the trading volume of our common stock is low.  The market price of our common stock may rise and fall in response to a variety of other factors, including:·announcements of technological or competitive developments;·general market or economic conditions;·market or economic conditions specific to particular geographical areas in which we operate;·acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or our competitors;·the gain or loss of a significant customer or order; or·changes in estimates of our financial performance or changes in recommendations by securities analysts regarding us or our industryIn addition, equity securities of many technology companies have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations even in periods when the capital markets generally are not distressed.  These price and volume fluctuations often have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies.Our intellectual property rights may not be adequately protected under the current state of the law.Our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights through patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and in other countries may not prevent misappropriation, and our failure to protect our proprietary rights could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and future prospects. A third party could, without authorization, copy or otherwise appropriate our proprietary information. Our agreements with employees and others who participate in development activities could be breached, we may not have adequate remedies for any breach, and our trade secrets may otherwise become known or independently developed by competitors.We may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights and we may incur defense costs and possibly royalty obligations or lose the right to use technology important to our business.From time to time, we receive claims by third parties asserting that our products violate their intellectual property rights.  Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be time consuming and expensive to litigate or settle and could divert management attention from administering our business.  A third party asserting infringement claims against us or our customers with respect to our current or future products may materially and adversely affect us by, for example, causing us to enter into costly royalty arrangements or forcing us to incur settlement or litigation costs.As a result of protective provisions in the Company's certificate of incorporation, the voting power of certain officers, directors and principal shareholders may be increased at future meetings of the Company's shareholders.The Company's certificate of incorporation provides that if a shareholder, other than shareholders subject to specific exceptions, acquires (after the date of the Company's 1998 recapitalization) 10% or more of the outstanding Class A common stock and does not own an equal or greater percentage of all then outstanding shares of both Class A and Class B common stock (all of which common stock must have been acquired after the date of the 1998 recapitalization), such shareholder must, within 90 days of the trigger date, purchase Class B common shares, in an amount and at a price determined in accordance with a formula described in the Company's certificate of incorporation, or forfeit its right to vote its Class A common shares. As of February 28, 2019, to the Company's knowledge, there was one shareholder of the Company's common stock with ownership in excess of 10% of Class A outstanding shares with no ownership of the Company's Class B common stock and with no basis for exception from the operation of the above-mentioned provisions. In order to vote its shares at Bel's next shareholders' meeting, this shareholder must either purchase the required number of Class B common shares or sell or otherwise transfer Class A common shares until its Class A holdings are under 10%. As of February 28, 2019, to the Company's knowledge, this shareholder owned 23.6% of the Company's Class A common stock and had not taken steps to either purchase the required number of Class B common shares or sell or otherwise transfer Class A common shares until its Class A holdings fall below 10%.  Unless and until this situation is satisfied in a manner permitted by the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the subject shareholder will not be permitted to vote its shares of common stock. To the extent that the voting rights of particular holders of Class A common stock are suspended as of times when the Company's shareholders vote due to the above-mentioned provisions, such suspension will have the effect of increasing the voting power of those holders of Class A common shares whose voting rights are not suspended.  As of February 28, 2019, Daniel Bernstein, the Company's chief executive officer, beneficially owned 354,255 Class A common shares (or 21.3%) of the outstanding Class A common shares whose voting rights were not suspended, and all directors and current executive officers as a group (which includes Daniel Bernstein) beneficially owned 360,448 Class A common shares (or 21.6%) of the outstanding Class A common shares whose voting rights were not suspended.12Return to IndexCyber risk and the failure to maintain the integrity of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties with which we do business, could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to an increasing number of various types of information technology vulnerabilities, threats and targeted computer crimes which pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers, or cyber-attacks or security breaches of our networks or systems, could result in the loss of customers and business opportunities, legal liability, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, other litigation, regulatory and legal risks and the costs associated therewith, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, remediation costs, increased cybersecurity protection costs, additional compliance costs, increased insurance premiums, and lost revenues, damage to the Company's competitiveness, stock price, and long-term shareholder value, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we attempt to mitigate these risks, our systems, networks, products, solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced and persistent threats. We also maintain and have access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer controls. Despite our efforts to protect such sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, our facilities and systems and those of our customers and third-party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches, theft, fraud, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors that could lead to the compromising of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, improper use of our systems, software solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.As a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to a number of procurement rules and regulations.We must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the award, administration, and performance of U.S. Government contracts. Government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and, in some instances, impose added costs on our business. A violation of specific laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties or the termination of our contracts or debarment from bidding on contracts. These fines and penalties could be imposed for failing to follow procurement integrity and bidding rules, employing improper billing practices or otherwise failing to follow cost accounting standards, receiving or paying kickbacks, or filing false claims. We have been, and expect to continue to be, subjected to audits and investigations by government agencies. The failure to comply with the terms of our government contracts could harm our business reputation. It could also result in our progress payments being withheld.In some instances, these laws and regulations impose terms or rights that are more favorable to the government than those typically available to commercial parties in negotiated transactions. For example, the U.S. Government may terminate any of our government contracts and, in general, subcontracts, at its convenience as well as for default based on performance. Upon termination for convenience of a fixed-price type contract, we normally are entitled to receive the purchase price for delivered items, reimbursement for allowable costs for work-in-process, and an allowance for profit on work actually completed on the contract or adjustment for loss if completion of performance would have resulted in a loss. Upon termination for convenience of a Federal Government cost reimbursement contract, we normally are entitled to reimbursement of allowable costs plus a portion of the fee. Such allowable costs would normally include our cost to terminate agreements with our suppliers and subcontractors. The amount of the fee recovered, if any, is related to the portion of the work accomplished prior to termination and is determined by negotiation"
0,BELFB,BEL FUSE INC,2018-03-09,"  Risk Factors
 The risks described below should be carefully considered before making an investment decision. These are the risk factors that we consider to be the most significant risk factors, but they are not the only risk factors that should be considered in making an investment decision. This Form 10-K also contains Forward-Looking Statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See the ""Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Information,"" above. Our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of the risk factors described below, under ""Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Information"" or with respect to specific Forward-Looking Statements presented herein. The trading price of our securities could decline due to any of these risks, and investors in our securities may lose all or part of their investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business in the future.We conduct business in a highly competitive industry.Our business is largely in a highly competitive worldwide industry, with relatively low barriers to competitive entry. We compete principally on the basis of product performance, quality, reliability, depth of product line, customer service, technological innovation, design, delivery time and price. The industry in which we operate has become increasingly concentrated and globalized in recent years and our major competitors, some of which are larger than Bel, have significant financial resources and technological capabilities.We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.Our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to effect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our credit agreement restricts our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due.In addition, we conduct a substantial portion of our operations through our subsidiaries, certain of which are not guarantors of our indebtedness. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Unless they are guarantors of our indebtedness, our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity, and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. In the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness.6Return to IndexOur inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations.If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default, the lenders under the credit agreement could terminate their commitments to loan money, the lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.Borrowings under our credit facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net earnings and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. As of December 31, 2017, we had $125.0 million of borrowings under our credit facility at a variable interest rate. A 1% increase or decrease in the assumed interest rates on the senior secured credit facilities would result in a $1.2 million increase or decrease in annual interest expense.Our high level of indebtedness could negatively impact our access to the capital markets and our ability to satisfy financial covenants under our existing credit agreement.We incurred substantial amounts of indebtedness to fund the acquisitions of Power Solutions and Connectivity Solutions in 2014, and we may need to incur additional indebtedness to finance operations or for other general corporate purposes.  Our consolidated principal amount of outstanding indebtedness was $125.0 million at December 31, 2017, resulting in a leverage ratio of 2.46x adjusted EBITDA, as calculated in accordance with our credit agreement.  Accordingly, our U.S. debt service requirements are significant in relation to our U.S. net sales and cash flow.  This leverage exposes us to risk in the event of downturns in our business, in our industry or in the economy generally, and may impair our operating flexibility and our ability to compete effectively.  Our current credit agreement requires us to maintain a certain covenant leverage ratio, and the ratio becomes more restrictive at specific dates during the term.  If we do not continue to satisfy this required ratio or receive waivers from our lenders, we will be in default under the credit agreement, which could result in an accelerated maturity of our debt obligations.Our backlog figures may not be reliable indicators.Many of the orders that comprise our backlog may be delayed, accelerated or canceled by customers without penalty. Customers may on occasion double order from multiple sources to ensure timely delivery when lead times are particularly long. Customers often cancel orders when business is weak and inventories are excessive.  Therefore, we cannot be certain that the amount of our backlog equals or exceeds the level of orders that will ultimately be delivered. Our results of operations could be adversely impacted if customers cancel a material portion of orders in our backlog.There are several factors which can cause us to lower our prices or otherwise cause our margins to suffer.Our prices and/or margins could be substantially impacted by the following factors:a) The average selling prices for our products tend to decrease over their life cycles, and customers put pressure on suppliers to lower prices even when production costs are increasing. Our profits suffer if we are not able to reduce our costs of production, introduce technological innovations as sales prices decline, or pass through cost increases to customers.b) Any drop in demand for our products or increase in supply of competitive products could cause a dramatic drop in our average sales prices which in turn could result in a decrease in our gross margins.  A shift in product mix could also have an unfavorable or favorable impact on our gross margins, depending upon the underlying raw material content and labor requirements of the associated products.c) Increased competition from low cost suppliers around the world has put further pressures on pricing.  We continually strive to lower our costs, negotiate better pricing for components and raw materials and improve our operating efficiencies.  Profit margins will be materially and adversely impacted if we are not able to reduce our costs of production or introduce technological innovations when sales prices decline.7Return to IndexOur annual effective income tax rate can change materially as a result of changes in our mix of U.S. and foreign earnings and other factors, including changes in tax laws and changes made by regulatory authorities.Our overall effective income tax rate is equal to our total tax expense as a percentage of total earnings before tax. However, income tax expense and benefits are not recognized on a global basis but rather on a jurisdictional or legal entity basis. Losses in one jurisdiction may not be used to offset profits in other jurisdictions and may cause an increase in our tax rate. Changes in statutory tax rates and laws, as well as ongoing audits by domestic and international authorities, could affect the amount of income taxes and other taxes paid by us. Also, changes in the mix of earnings (or losses) between jurisdictions and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes, among other factors, could have a significant effect on our overall effective income tax rate. In addition, our effective tax rate would increase if we were unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions, or if we were otherwise required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets.We are subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions. As a result, any adverse development in the tax laws of any of these jurisdictions or any disagreement with our tax positions could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations.We are subject to taxation in, and to the tax laws and regulations of, multiple jurisdictions as a result of the international scope of our operations and our corporate and financing structure. We are also subject to transfer pricing laws with respect to our intercompany transactions, including those relating to the flow of funds among our companies. Adverse developments in these laws or regulations, or any change in position regarding the application, administration or interpretation thereof, in any applicable jurisdiction, could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or results of our operations. In addition, the tax authorities in any applicable jurisdiction, including the United States, may disagree with the positions we have taken or intend to take regarding the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions. If any applicable tax authorities, including U.S. tax authorities, were to successfully challenge the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of our operations.Our business may be materially affected by changes to fiscal and tax policies. Negative or unexpected tax consequences could materially adversely affect our results of operations.On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the ""Tax Act"") which includes significant changes to the U.S. corporate income tax system. The effect of the international provisions of the Tax Act resulted in a one-time deemed repatriation tax on unremitted foreign earnings and profits (a ""transition tax""). The Company's estimate of the transition tax was calculated using currently available information; however, the Company is continuing to evaluate the underlying documentation and revisions to the current calculation may occur.In the PRC, we are challenged to match availability of workers and maintain lead times in line with customer demand for certain of our products, which demand has been highly volatile in recent years.  This volatility can materially adversely affect Bel's results.In the PRC, the availability of labor is cyclical and is significantly affected by the migration of workers in relation to the annual Lunar New Year holiday as well as economic conditions in the PRC.  In addition, we have little visibility into the ordering habits of our customers and can be subjected to large and unpredictable variations in demand for our products.  Accordingly, we must continually recruit and train new workers to replace those lost to attrition each year and to address peaks in demand that may occur from time to time.  These recruiting and training efforts and related inefficiencies, as well as overtime required in order to meet demand, can add volatility to the costs incurred by the Company for labor in the PRC.Increases in minimum wage rates in the PRC will have an unfavorable impact on our profit margins.Approximately one-third of our total sales are generated from labor intensive magnetic products, which are primarily manufactured in the PRC.  Wage rates in the PRC, which are mandated by the government, now have higher minimum wage and overtime requirements.  Effective February 1, 2018, the PRC issued a 30% increase to the minimum wage in a region where one of Bel's factories is located.  We anticipate this increase in minimum wage to translate into 19-20% higher labor costs (or an increase of approximately $1.0 million - $1.4 million per year) at this facility going forward.  This and any future increases in minimum wage rates will have an unfavorable impact on our profit margins.We are dependent on our ability to develop new products.Our future operating results are dependent, in part, on our ability to develop, produce and market new and more technologically advanced products. There are numerous risks inherent in this process, including the risks that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to timely develop and bring to market new products and applications to meet customers' changing needs.8Return to IndexOur insurance policies may not cover all operating risks and a casualty loss beyond the limits of our coverage could adversely impact our business.Our business is subject to operating hazards and risks relating to handling, storing, transporting and use of the products we sell. We maintain insurance policies in amounts and with coverage and deductibles that we believe are reasonable and prudent. Nevertheless, our insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us from all liabilities and expenses that may arise from claims for personal injury or death or property damage arising in the ordinary course of business, and our current levels of insurance may not be maintained or available in the future at economical prices. If a significant liability claim is brought against us that is not adequately covered by insurance, we may have to pay the claim with our own funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations.Our acquisitions may not produce the anticipated results.A significant portion of our growth has been attributable to acquisitions. We cannot assure that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future. If an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our other businesses, our results of operations, enterprise value, market value and prospects could all be materially and adversely affected.  Integration of new acquisitions into our consolidated operations may result in lower average operating results for the group as a whole, and may divert management's focus from the ongoing operations of the Company during the integration period.Our strategy also focuses on the reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses through the integration or elimination of redundant sales facilities and administrative functions at acquired companies.  If we are unable to achieve our expectations with respect to our acquisitions, such inability could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations.  In connection with the 2014 Acquisitions, we recorded $105.4 million of goodwill and $73.2 million of other intangible assets.  During the first half of 2016, due to a decline in general market conditions, which lowered the Company's forecasted revenues and EBITDA growth rates for each of its reporting units, we recognized impairment charges of $101.7 million related to goodwill and $4.3 million related to indefinite-lived intangible assets.  If the acquisitions fail to perform up to our expectations, or if there is further weakening of economic conditions, we could be required to record additional impairment charges.We may not achieve all of the expected benefits from our restructuring programs.We have implemented a number of restructuring programs in recent years and we may continue to restructure or rationalize our operations in future periods. These programs include various cost savings, the consolidation of certain facilities and the reduction of headcount. We make certain assumptions in estimating the anticipated savings we expect to achieve under such programs, which include the estimated savings from the elimination of certain headcount and the consolidation of facilities. These assumptions may turn out to be incorrect due to a variety of factors. In addition, our ability to realize the expected benefits from these programs is subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unsuccessful in implementing these programs or if we do not achieve our expected results, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected or our business operations could be disrupted.The global nature of our operations exposes us to numerous risks that could materially adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.We operate in 15 countries, and our products are distributed in those countries as well as in other parts of the world. A large portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside of the United States and a large portion of our sales are generated outside of the United States. Operations outside of the United States, particularly operations in developing regions, are subject to various risks that may not be present or as significant for our U.S. operations. Economic uncertainty in some of the geographic regions in which we operate, including developing regions, could result in the disruption of commerce and negatively impact cash flows from our operations in those areas.Risks inherent in our international operations include: • foreign currency exchange controls and tax rates; • foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, including devaluations; • the potential for changes in regional and local economic conditions, including local inflationary pressures; • restrictive governmental actions such as those on transfer or repatriation of funds and trade protection matters, including antidumping duties, tariffs, embargoes and prohibitions or restrictions on acquisitions or joint ventures; 9Return to Index• changes in laws and regulations, including the laws and policies of the United States affecting trade and foreign investment; • the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems; • variations in protection of intellectual property and other legal rights; • more expansive legal rights of foreign unions or works councils; • changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; • inability or regulatory limitations on our ability to move goods across borders;   • social plans that prohibit or increase the cost of certain restructuring actions; • the potential for nationalization of enterprises or facilities; and • unsettled political conditions and possible terrorist attacks against U.S. or other interests.As a multi-national company, we are faced with increased complexities due to recent changes to the U.S. corporate tax code relating to our unremitted foreign earnings, potential revisions to international tax law treaties, and renegotiated trade deals, including potential changes to the North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).  In addition, other events, such as the United Kingdom's continued efforts to exit the European Union, also create a level of uncertainty.  If we are unable to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks, it could have a material and adverse effect on our business and our results of operations and financial condition.The loss of certain substantial customers could materially and adversely affect us.During the year ended December 31, 2017, sales to one direct customer exceeded 10% of our consolidated net sales. Hon Hai Precision Industry Company Ltd., a contract manufacturer utilized by various end customers, represented 11.7% of our 2017 consolidated net sales. We believe that the loss of this customer could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations.  We have experienced significant concentrations in prior years. See Note 12, ""Segments"" for additional disclosures related to our significant customers.We may experience labor unrest.As we implement transfers of certain of our operations, we may experience strikes or other types of labor unrest as a result of lay-offs or termination of employees in higher labor cost countries.  Our manufacturing facilities in New York State, the United Kingdom and Mexico are represented by labor unions and substantially all of our factory workers in the PRC are represented by government-sponsored unions.We may experience labor shortages.Government, economic, social and labor policies in the PRC may cause shortages of factory labor in areas where we have some of our products manufactured.  If we are required to manufacture more of these products outside of the PRC as a result of such shortages, our margins will likely be materially adversely affected.There are risks related to the implementation of our new global enterprise resource planning system.We are currently engaged in a multi-year process of conforming the majority of our operations onto one global enterprise resource planning system (""ERP"").  The ERP is designed to improve the efficiency of our supply chain and financial transaction processes, accurately maintain our books and records, and provide information important to the operation of the business to our management team. The implementation of the ERP will continue to require significant investment of human and financial resources, and we may experience significant delays, increased costs and other difficulties as a result. Any significant disruption or deficiency in the design and implementation of the ERP could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fulfill and invoice customer orders, apply cash receipts, place purchase orders with suppliers, and make cash disbursements, and could negatively impact data processing and electronic communications among business locations, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations. We also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing necessary upgrades to those systems while we implement the new ERP system. While we have invested significant resources in planning and project management, significant implementation issues may arise.Expanding and evolving data privacy laws and regulations could impact our business and expose us to increased liability.The General Data Protection Regulation (""GDPR""), which will become effective in the European Union in May 2018, imposes significant new requirements on how we collect, process and transfer personal data, as well as significant financial penalties for non-compliance.  Any inability to adequately address privacy concerns, even if unfounded, or to comply with the more complex privacy or data protection laws, regulations and privacy standards, could lead to significant financial penalties, which may result in a material and adverse effect on our results of operations.10Return to IndexOur results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted by environmental and other regulations.Our manufacturing operations, products and/or product packaging are subject to environmental laws and regulations governing air emissions; wastewater discharges; the handling, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances, wastes and certain chemicals used or generated in our manufacturing processes; employee health and safety labeling or other notifications with respect to the content or other aspects of our processes, products or packaging; restrictions on the use of certain materials in or on design aspects of our products or product packaging; and, responsibility for disposal of products or product packaging. More stringent environmental regulations may be enacted in the future, and we cannot presently determine the modifications, if any, in our operations that any such future regulations might require, or the cost of compliance with these regulations.We may face risks relating to climate change that could have an adverse impact on our business.Greenhouse gas (""GHG"") emissions have increasingly become the subject of substantial international, national, regional, state and local attention.  GHG emission regulations have been promulgated in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate, and additional GHG requirements are in various stages of development.  Such measures could require us to modify existing or obtain new permits, implement additional pollution control technology, curtail operations or increase our operating costs.  Any additional regulation of GHG emissions, including a cap-and-trade system, technology mandate, emissions tax, reporting requirement or other program, could materially adversely affect our business. Regulations related to conflict minerals will cause the Company to incur additional expenses and may have other adverse consequences.The SEC has adopted inquiry, diligence and additional disclosure requirements related to certain minerals sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and surrounding countries, or ""conflict minerals"", that are necessary to the functionality of a product manufactured, or contracted to be manufactured, by an SEC reporting company. The minerals that the rules cover are commonly referred to as ""3TG"" and include tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold. As a public company, Bel was required to make its first annual filing under these new rules on May 31, 2014.  In such annual filings, Bel describes the due diligence it has undertaken of its suppliers in an effort to determine the source of any conflict minerals used in its products or components.  These due diligence requirements are ongoing, and Bel will continue to incur additional costs, which could be substantial, related to its due diligence and compliance process.  In addition, the Company's supply chain is complex, and if it is not able to determine with certainty the source and chain of custody for all conflict minerals used in its products that are sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and surrounding countries, then the Company may face reputational challenges with customers, investors or others.  As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering ""conflict free"" minerals, if the Company chooses to use only conflict minerals that are ""conflict free"" in its products and components, the Company cannot be sure that it will be able to obtain necessary materials from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices.     Our results may vary substantially from period to period.Our revenues and expenses may vary significantly from one accounting period to another accounting period due to a variety of factors, including customers' buying decisions, our product mix, the volatility of raw material costs, the impact of competition, the impact of the Chinese New Year and general market and economic conditions.  Such variations could significantly impact our stock price.A shortage of availability or an increase in the cost of high-quality raw materials, components and other resources may adversely impact our ability to procure these items at cost effective prices and thus may negatively impact profit margins.Our results of operations may be materially adversely impacted by difficulties in obtaining raw materials, supplies, power, labor, natural resources and any other items needed for the production of our products, as well as by the effects of quality deviations in raw materials and the effects of significant fluctuations in the prices of existing inventories and purchase commitments for these materials.  Many of these materials and components are produced by a limited number of suppliers and their availability to us may be constrained by supplier capacity.  See ""Key Factors Affecting our Business"" in Item 7. of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of how pricing and availability of materials is currently impacting our business.As product life cycles shorten and during periods of market slowdowns, the risk of materials obsolescence increases and this may materially and adversely impact our financial results.Rapid shifts in demand for various products may cause some of our inventory of raw materials, components or finished goods to become obsolete.11Return to IndexThe life cycles and demand for our products are directly linked to the life cycles and demand for the end products into which they are designed.  Rapid shifts in the life cycles or demand for these end products due to technological shifts, economic conditions or other market trends may result in material amounts of either raw materials or finished goods inventory becoming obsolete.   While the Company works diligently to manage inventory levels, rapid shifts in demand may result in obsolete or excess inventory and materially adversely impact financial results.A loss of the services of the Company's executive officers or other skilled associates could negatively impact our operations and results.The success of the Company's operations is largely dependent upon the performance of its executive officers, managers, engineers and sales people.  Many of these individuals have a significant number of years of experience within the Company and/or the industry in which we compete and would be extremely difficult to replace.  The loss of the services of any of these associates may materially and adversely impact our results of operations if we are unable to replace them in a timely manner.Our stock price, like that of many technology companies, has been and may continue to be volatile.The market price of our common stock may fluctuate as a result of variations in our quarterly operating results and other factors beyond our control.  These fluctuations may be exaggerated if the trading volume of our common stock is low.  The market price of our common stock may rise and fall in response to a variety of other factors, including:·announcements of technological or competitive developments;·general market or economic conditions;·market or economic conditions specific to particular geographical areas in which we operate;·acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or our competitors;·the gain or loss of a significant customer or order; or·changes in estimates of our financial performance or changes in recommendations by securities analysts regarding us or our industryIn addition, equity securities of many technology companies have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations even in periods when the capital markets generally are not distressed.  These price and volume fluctuations often have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies.Our intellectual property rights may not be adequately protected under the current state of the law.Our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights through patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and in other countries may not prevent misappropriation, and our failure to protect our proprietary rights could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and future prospects. A third party could, without authorization, copy or otherwise appropriate our proprietary information. Our agreements with employees and others who participate in development activities could be breached, we may not have adequate remedies for any breach, and our trade secrets may otherwise become known or independently developed by competitors.We may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights and we may incur defense costs and possibly royalty obligations or lose the right to use technology important to our business.From time to time, we receive claims by third parties asserting that our products violate their intellectual property rights.  Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be time consuming and expensive to litigate or settle and could divert management attention from administering our business.  A third party asserting infringement claims against us or our customers with respect to our current or future products may materially and adversely affect us by, for example, causing us to enter into costly royalty arrangements or forcing us to incur settlement or litigation costs.As a result of protective provisions in the Company's certificate of incorporation, the voting power of certain officers, directors and principal shareholders may be increased at future meetings of the Company's shareholders.The Company's certificate of incorporation provides that if a shareholder, other than shareholders subject to specific exceptions, acquires (after the date of the Company's 1998 recapitalization) 10% or more of the outstanding Class A common stock and does not own an equal or greater percentage of all then outstanding shares of both Class A and Class B common stock (all of which common stock must have been acquired after the date of the 1998 recapitalization), such shareholder must, within 90 days of the trigger date, purchase Class B common shares, in an amount and at a price determined in accordance with a formula described in the Company's certificate of incorporation, or forfeit its right to vote its Class A common shares. As of February 28, 2018, to the Company's knowledge, there was one shareholder of the Company's common stock with ownership in excess of 10% of Class A outstanding shares with no ownership of the Company's Class B common stock and with no basis for exception from the operation of the above-mentioned provisions. In order to vote its shares at Bel's next shareholders' meeting, this shareholder must either purchase the required number of Class B common shares or sell or otherwise transfer Class A common shares until its Class A holdings are under 10%. As of February 28, 2018, to the Company's knowledge, this shareholder owned 23.2% of the Company's Class A common stock and had not taken steps to either purchase the required number of Class B common shares or sell or otherwise transfer Class A common shares until its Class A holdings fall below 10%.  Unless and until this situation is satisfied in a manner permitted by the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the subject shareholder will not be permitted to vote its shares of common stock.12Return to Index To the extent that the voting rights of particular holders of Class A common stock are suspended as of times when the Company's shareholders vote due to the above-mentioned provisions, such suspension will have the effect of increasing the voting power of those holders of Class A common shares whose voting rights are not suspended.  As of February 28, 2018, Daniel Bernstein, the Company's chief executive officer, beneficially owned 353,631 Class A common shares (or 21.1%) of the outstanding Class A common shares whose voting rights were not suspended, and all directors and current executive officers as a group (which includes Daniel Bernstein) beneficially owned 357,987 Class A common shares (or 21.4%) of the outstanding Class A common shares whose voting rights were not suspended.Cyber risk and the failure to maintain the integrity of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties with which we do business, could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to an increasing number of various types of information technology vulnerabilities, threats and targeted computer crimes which pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers, or cyber-attacks or security breaches of our networks or systems, could result in the loss of customers and business opportunities, legal liability, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, and additional compliance costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we attempt to mitigate these risks, our systems, networks, products, solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced and persistent threats. We also maintain and have access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer controls. Despite our efforts to protect such sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, our facilities and systems and those of our customers and third-party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches, theft, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors that could lead to the compromising of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, improper use of our systems, software solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.As a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to a number of procurement rules and regulations.We must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the award, administration, and performance of U.S. Government contracts. Government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and, in some instances, impose added costs on our business. A violation of specific laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties or the termination of our contracts or debarment from bidding on contracts. These fines and penalties could be imposed for failing to follow procurement integrity and bidding rules, employing improper billing practices or otherwise failing to follow cost accounting standards, receiving or paying kickbacks, or filing false claims. We have been, and expect to continue to be, subjected to audits and investigations by government agencies. The failure to comply with the terms of our government contracts could harm our business reputation. It could also result in our progress payments being withheld.In some instances, these laws and regulations impose terms or rights that are more favorable to the government than those typically available to commercial parties in negotiated transactions. For example, the U.S. Government may terminate any of our government contracts and, in general, subcontracts, at its convenience as well as for default based on performance. Upon termination for convenience of a fixed-price type contract, we normally are entitled to receive the purchase price for delivered items, reimbursement for allowable costs for work-in-process, and an allowance for profit on work actually completed on the contract or adjustment for loss if completion of performance would have resulted in a loss. Upon termination for convenience of a Federal Government cost reimbursement contract, we normally are entitled to reimbursement of allowable costs plus a portion of the fee. Such allowable costs would normally include our cost to terminate agreements with our suppliers and subcontractors. The amount of the fee recovered, if any, is related to the portion of the work accomplished prior to termination and is determined by negotiation"
13,BELFB,BEL FUSE INC,2017-03-10,"  Risk Factors
 The risks described below should be carefully considered before making an investment decision. These are the risk factors that we consider to be the most significant risk factors, but they are not the only risk factors that should be considered in making an investment decision. This Form 10-K also contains Forward-Looking Statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See the ""Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Information,"" above. Our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of the risk factors described below, under ""Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Information"" or with respect to specific Forward-Looking Statements presented herein. The trading price of our securities could decline due to any of these risks, and investors in our securities may lose all or part of their investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business in the future.We conduct business in a highly competitive industry.Our business is largely in a highly competitive worldwide industry, with relatively low barriers to competitive entry. We compete principally on the basis of product performance, quality, reliability, depth of product line, customer service, technological innovation, design, delivery time and price. The industry in which we operate has become increasingly concentrated and globalized in recent years and our major competitors, some of which are larger than Bel, have significant financial resources and technological capabilities.6Return to IndexWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.Our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to effect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our credit agreement restricts our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due.In addition, we conduct a substantial portion of our operations through our subsidiaries, certain of which are not guarantors of our indebtedness. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Unless they are guarantors of our indebtedness, our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity, and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. In the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness.Our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations.If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default, the lenders under the credit agreement could terminate their commitments to loan money, the lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.Our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.Borrowings under our credit facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net earnings and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. As of December 31, 2016, we had $143.8 million of borrowings under our credit facility at a variable interest rate. A 1% increase or decrease in the assumed interest rates on the senior secured credit facilities would result in a $1.4 million increase or decrease in annual interest expense.Our high level of indebtedness could negatively impact our access to the capital markets and our ability to satisfy financial covenants under our existing credit agreement.We incurred substantial amounts of indebtedness to fund the acquisitions of Power Solutions and Connectivity Solutions in 2014, and we may need to incur additional indebtedness to finance operations or for other general corporate purposes.  Our consolidated principal amount of outstanding indebtedness was $143.8 million at December 31, 2016, resulting in a leverage ratio of 2.53x adjusted EBITDA, as calculated in accordance with our credit agreement.  Accordingly, our debt service requirements are significant in relation to our net sales and cash flow.  This leverage exposes us to risk in the event of downturns in our business, in our industry or in the economy generally, and may impair our operating flexibility and our ability to compete effectively.  Our current credit agreement requires us to maintain a certain covenant leverage ratio, and the ratio becomes more restrictive at specific dates during the term.  If we do not continue to satisfy this required ratio or receive waivers from our lenders, we will be in default under the credit agreement, which could result in an accelerated maturity of our debt obligations.Our backlog figures may not be reliable indicators.Many of the orders that comprise our backlog may be delayed, accelerated or canceled by customers without penalty. Customers may on occasion double order from multiple sources to ensure timely delivery when lead times are particularly long. Customers often cancel orders when business is weak and inventories are excessive.  Therefore, we cannot be certain that the amount of our backlog equals or exceeds the level of orders that will ultimately be delivered. Our results of operations could be adversely impacted if customers cancel a material portion of orders in our backlog.7Return to IndexThere are several factors which can cause us to lower our prices or otherwise cause our margins to suffer.Our prices and/or margins could be substantially impacted by the following factors:a)  The average selling prices for our products tend to decrease over their life cycles, and customers put pressure on suppliers to lower prices even when production costs are increasing. Our profits suffer if we are not able to reduce our costs of production, introduce technological innovations as sales prices decline, or pass through cost increases to customers.b)  Any drop in demand for our products or increase in supply of competitive products could cause a dramatic drop in our average sales prices which in turn could result in a decrease in our gross margins.  A shift in product mix could also have an unfavorable or favorable impact on our gross margins, depending upon the underlying raw material content and labor requirements of the associated products.c)  Increased competition from low cost suppliers around the world has put further pressures on pricing.  We continually strive to lower our costs, negotiate better pricing for components and raw materials and improve our operating efficiencies.  Profit margins will be materially and adversely impacted if we are not able to reduce our costs of production or introduce technological innovations when sales prices decline.Our annual effective income tax rate can change materially as a result of changes in our mix of U.S. and foreign earnings and other factors, including changes in tax laws and changes made by regulatory authorities.Our overall effective income tax rate is equal to our total tax expense as a percentage of total earnings before tax. However, income tax expense and benefits are not recognized on a global basis but rather on a jurisdictional or legal entity basis. Losses in one jurisdiction may not be used to offset profits in other jurisdictions and may cause an increase in our tax rate. Changes in statutory tax rates and laws, as well as ongoing audits by domestic and international authorities, could affect the amount of income taxes and other taxes paid by us. For example, legislative proposals to change U.S. taxation of non-U.S. earnings could increase our effective tax rate. Also, changes in the mix of earnings (or losses) between jurisdictions and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes, among other factors, could have a significant effect on our overall effective income tax rate. In addition, our effective tax rate would increase if we were unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions, or if we were otherwise required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets.We are subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions. As a result, any adverse development in the tax laws of any of these jurisdictions or any disagreement with our tax positions could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations.We are subject to taxation in, and to the tax laws and regulations of, multiple jurisdictions as a result of the international scope of our operations and our corporate and financing structure. We are also subject to transfer pricing laws with respect to our intercompany transactions, including those relating to the flow of funds among our companies. Adverse developments in these laws or regulations, or any change in position regarding the application, administration or interpretation thereof, in any applicable jurisdiction, could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or results of our operations. In addition, the tax authorities in any applicable jurisdiction, including the United States, may disagree with the positions we have taken or intend to take regarding the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions. If any applicable tax authorities, including U.S. tax authorities, were to successfully challenge the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of our operations. In the PRC, we are challenged to match availability of workers and maintain lead times in line with customer demand for certain of our products, which demand has been highly volatile in recent years.  This volatility can materially adversely affect Bel's results.In the PRC, the availability of labor is cyclical and is significantly affected by the migration of workers in relation to the annual Lunar New Year holiday as well as economic conditions in the PRC.  In addition, we have little visibility into the ordering habits of our customers and can be subjected to large and unpredictable variations in demand for our products.  Accordingly, we must continually recruit and train new workers to replace those lost to attrition each year and to address peaks in demand that may occur from time to time.  These recruiting and training efforts and related inefficiencies, as well as overtime required in order to meet demand, can add volatility to the costs incurred by the Company for labor in the PRC. We are dependent on our ability to develop new products. Our future operating results are dependent, in part, on our ability to develop, produce and market new and more technologically advanced products. There are numerous risks inherent in this process, including the risks that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to timely develop and bring to market new products and applications to meet customers' changing needs. 8Return to IndexOur insurance policies may not cover all operating risks and a casualty loss beyond the limits of our coverage could adversely impact our business.Our business is subject to operating hazards and risks relating to handling, storing, transporting and use of the products we sell. We maintain insurance policies in amounts and with coverage and deductibles that we believe are reasonable and prudent. Nevertheless, our insurance coverage may not be adequate to protect us from all liabilities and expenses that may arise from claims for personal injury or death or property damage arising in the ordinary course of business, and our current levels of insurance may not be maintained or available in the future at economical prices. If a significant liability claim is brought against us that is not adequately covered by insurance, we may have to pay the claim with our own funds, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations.Our acquisitions may not produce the anticipated results.A significant portion of our growth has been attributable to acquisitions. We cannot assure that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future. If an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our other businesses, our results of operations, enterprise value, market value and prospects could all be materially and adversely affected.  Integration of new acquisitions into our consolidated operations may result in lower average operating results for the group as a whole, and may divert management's focus from the ongoing operations of the Company during the integration period.Our strategy also focuses on the reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses through the integration or elimination of redundant sales facilities and administrative functions at acquired companies. The Company completed two acquisitions in 2014, as previously described in Item 1 of this Form 10-K.  If we are unable to achieve our expectations with respect to these or future acquisitions, such inability could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations.  In connection with the 2014 Acquisitions, we recorded $105.4 million of goodwill and $73.2 million of other intangible assets.  During the first half of 2016, due to a decline in general market conditions, which lowered the Company's forecasted revenues and EBITDA growth rates for each of its reporting units, we recognized impairment charges of $101.7 million related to goodwill and $4.3 million related to  indefinite-lived intangible assets.  If the acquisitions fail to perform up to our expectations, as a result of further weakening of economic conditions, we could be required to record additional impairment charges.We may not achieve all of the expected benefits from our restructuring programs.We have implemented a number of restructuring programs in recent years and we may continue to restructure or rationalize our operations in future periods. These programs include various cost savings, the consolidation of certain facilities and the reduction of headcount. We make certain assumptions in estimating the anticipated savings we expect to achieve under such programs, which include the estimated savings from the elimination of certain headcount and the consolidation of facilities. These assumptions may turn out to be incorrect due to a variety of factors. In addition, our ability to realize the expected benefits from these programs is subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unsuccessful in implementing these programs or if we do not achieve our expected results, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected or our business operations could be disrupted.The global nature of our operations exposes us to numerous risks that could materially adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.We operate in 15 countries, and our products are distributed in those countries as well as in other parts of the world. A large portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside of the United States and a large portion of our sales are generated outside of the United States. Operations outside of the United States, particularly operations in developing regions, are subject to various risks that may not be present or as significant for our U.S. operations. Economic uncertainty in some of the geographic regions in which we operate, including developing regions, could result in the disruption of commerce and negatively impact cash flows from our operations in those areas.Risks inherent in our international operations include: • foreign currency exchange controls and tax rates; • foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, including devaluations; • the potential for changes in regional and local economic conditions, including local inflationary pressures; 9Return to Index• restrictive governmental actions such as those on transfer or repatriation of funds and trade protection matters, including antidumping duties, tariffs, embargoes and prohibitions or restrictions on acquisitions or joint ventures; • changes in laws and regulations, including the laws and policies of the United States affecting trade and foreign investment; • the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems; • variations in protection of intellectual property and other legal rights; • more expansive legal rights of foreign unions or works councils; • changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; • Inability or regulatory limitations on our ability to move goods across borders;   • social plans that prohibit or increase the cost of certain restructuring actions; • the potential for nationalization of enterprises or facilities; and • unsettled political conditions and possible terrorist attacks against U.S. or other interests.In addition, there are potential tax inefficiencies and tax costs in repatriating funds from our non-U.S. subsidiaries.On June 23, 2016, the United Kingdom (UK) held a referendum in which voters approved an exit from the European Union (the ""EU""), commonly referred to as ""Brexit"".  As a result of the referendum, it is expected that the British government will begin negotiating the terms of the UK's future relationship with the EU.  Although it is unknown what those terms will be, it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the UK and EU countries and increased regulatory complexities and that such restrictions could materially adversely impact our Company.In addition, the U.S. federal government has made explicit statements about its intention to make changes to U.S. trade policy, including signing an executive order to withdraw from the negotiating process of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, renegotiate the terms of NAFTA, and imposing border taxes on imports into the U.S. We manufacture a significant amount of our products in Mexico and any legislation enacted that impacts the relationship between the U.S. and Mexico and/or the continuity of NAFTA could materially and adversely affect our consolidated financial position or results of operations. If enacted, any legislation by the U.S. federal government that restricts trade, such as tariffs, trade barriers, and other protectionist or retaliatory measures taken by governments in Europe, Asia, and other countries, could adversely impact our ability to sell products and services in our foreign markets, and could also impact some of our customers and their demand for our products.Furthermore, a large portion of our sales outside of the U.S. are denominated in U.S. dollars. As a result, an increase in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive and/or less affordable in foreign markets.These and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our international operations and, consequently, on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. The loss of certain substantial customers could materially and adversely affect us.During the year ended December 31, 2016, sales to one direct customer exceeded 10% of our consolidated net sales. Hon Hai Precision Industry Company Ltd., a contract manufacturer utilized by various end customers, represented 12.0% of our 2016 consolidated net sales. We believe that the loss of this customer could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations.  We have experienced significant concentrations in prior years. See Note 12, ""Segments"" for additional disclosures related to our significant customers.We may experience labor unrest.As we implement transfers of certain of our operations, we may experience strikes or other types of labor unrest as a result of lay-offs or termination of employees in higher labor cost countries.  Our manufacturing facilities in New York State, the United Kingdom and Mexico are represented by labor unions and substantially all of our factory workers in the PRC are represented by government-sponsored unions.We may experience labor shortages.Government, economic, social and labor policies in the PRC may cause shortages of factory labor in areas where we have some of our products manufactured.  If we are required to manufacture more of these products outside of the PRC as a result of such shortages, our margins will likely be materially adversely affected.10Return to IndexThere are risks related to the implementation of our new global enterprise resource planning system.We are currently engaged in a multi-year process of conforming the majority of our operations onto one global enterprise resource planning system (""ERP"").  The ERP is designed to improve the efficiency of our supply chain and financial transaction processes, accurately maintain our books and records, and provide information important to the operation of the business to our management team. The implementation of the ERP will continue to require significant investment of human and financial resources, and we may experience significant delays, increased costs and other difficulties as a result. Any significant disruption or deficiency in the design and implementation of the ERP could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fulfill and invoice customer orders, apply cash receipts, place purchase orders with suppliers, and make cash disbursements, and could negatively impact data processing and electronic communications among business locations, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations. We also face the challenge of supporting our older systems and implementing necessary upgrades to those systems while we implement the new ERP system. While we have invested significant resources in planning and project management, significant implementation issues may arise.Our results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted by environmental and other regulations.Our manufacturing operations, products and/or product packaging are subject to environmental laws and regulations governing air emissions; wastewater discharges; the handling, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances, wastes and certain chemicals used or generated in our manufacturing processes; employee health and safety labeling or other notifications with respect to the content or other aspects of our processes, products or packaging; restrictions on the use of certain materials in or on design aspects of our products or product packaging; and, responsibility for disposal of products or product packaging. More stringent environmental regulations may be enacted in the future, and we cannot presently determine the modifications, if any, in our operations that any such future regulations might require, or the cost of compliance with these regulations. We may face risks relating to climate change that could have an adverse impact on our business.Greenhouse gas (""GHG"") emissions have increasingly become the subject of substantial international, national, regional, state and local attention.  GHG emission regulations have been promulgated in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate, and additional GHG requirements are in various stages of development.  Such measures could require us to modify existing or obtain new permits, implement additional pollution control technology, curtail operations or increase our operating costs.  Any additional regulation of GHG emissions, including a cap-and-trade system, technology mandate, emissions tax, reporting requirement or other program, could materially adversely affect our business.Regulations related to conflict minerals will cause the Company to incur additional expenses and may have other adverse consequences.The SEC has adopted inquiry, diligence and additional disclosure requirements related to certain minerals sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and surrounding countries, or ""conflict minerals"", that are necessary to the functionality of a product manufactured, or contracted to be manufactured, by an SEC reporting company. The minerals that the rules cover are commonly referred to as ""3TG"" and include tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold. As a public company, Bel was required to make its first filing under these new rules on May 31, 2014.  In such filing, Bel described the due diligence it had undertaken of its suppliers in an effort to determine the source of any conflict minerals used in its products or components.  These due diligence requirements are ongoing, and Bel will continue to incur additional costs, which could be substantial, related to its due diligence and compliance process.  In addition, the Company's supply chain is complex, and if it is not able to determine with certainty the source and chain of custody for all conflict minerals used in its products that are sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and surrounding countries or determine that its products are ""conflict free"", then the Company may face reputational challenges with customers, investors or others.  As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering ""conflict free"" minerals, if the Company chooses to use only conflict minerals that are ""conflict free"" in its products and components, the Company cannot be sure that it will be able to obtain necessary materials from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices.     Our results may vary substantially from period to period.Our revenues and expenses may vary significantly from one accounting period to another accounting period due to a variety of factors, including customers' buying decisions, our product mix, the volatility of raw material costs, the impact of competition, the impact of the Chinese New Year and general market and economic conditions.  Such variations could significantly impact our stock price.A shortage of availability or an increase in the cost of high-quality raw materials, components and other resources may adversely impact our ability to procure these items at cost effective prices and thus may negatively impact profit margins.Our results of operations may be materially adversely impacted by difficulties in obtaining raw materials, supplies, power, labor, natural resources and any other items needed for the production of our products, as well as by the effects of quality deviations in raw materials and the effects of significant fluctuations in the prices of existing inventories and purchase commitments for these materials.  Many of these materials and components are produced by a limited number of suppliers and their availability to us may be constrained by supplier capacity.11Return to IndexAs product life cycles shorten and during periods of market slowdowns, the risk of materials obsolescence increases and this may materially and adversely impact our financial results.Rapid shifts in demand for various products may cause some of our inventory of raw materials, components or finished goods to become obsolete.The life cycles and demand for our products are directly linked to the life cycles and demand for the end products into which they are designed.  Rapid shifts in the life cycles or demand for these end products due to technological shifts, economic conditions or other market trends may result in material amounts of either raw materials or finished goods inventory becoming obsolete.   While the Company works diligently to manage inventory levels, rapid shifts in demand may result in obsolete or excess inventory and materially adversely impact financial results.A loss of the services of the Company's executive officers or other skilled associates could negatively impact our operations and results.The success of the Company's operations is largely dependent upon the performance of its executive officers, managers, engineers and sales people.  Many of these individuals have a significant number of years of experience within the Company and/or the industry in which we compete and would be extremely difficult to replace.  The loss of the services of any of these associates may materially and adversely impact our results of operations if we are unable to replace them in a timely manner.Our stock price, like that of many technology companies, has been and may continue to be volatile.The market price of our common stock may fluctuate as a result of variations in our quarterly operating results and other factors beyond our control.  These fluctuations may be exaggerated if the trading volume of our common stock is low.  The market price of our common stock may rise and fall in response to a variety of other factors, including:·announcements of technological or competitive developments;·general market or economic conditions;·market or economic conditions specific to particular geographical areas in which we operate;·acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or our competitors;·the gain or loss of a significant customer or order; or·changes in estimates of our financial performance or changes in recommendations by securities analysts regarding us or our industryIn addition, equity securities of many technology companies have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations even in periods when the capital markets generally are not distressed.  These price and volume fluctuations often have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies.Our intellectual property rights may not be adequately protected under the current state of the law.Our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights through patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and in other countries may not prevent misappropriation, and our failure to protect our proprietary rights could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and future prospects. A third party could, without authorization, copy or otherwise appropriate our proprietary information. Our agreements with employees and others who participate in development activities could be breached, we may not have adequate remedies for any breach, and our trade secrets may otherwise become known or independently developed by competitors.We may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights and we may incur defense costs and possibly royalty obligations or lose the right to use technology important to our business.From time to time, we receive claims by third parties asserting that our products violate their intellectual property rights.  Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be time consuming and expensive to litigate or settle and could divert management attention from administering our business.  A third party asserting infringement claims against us or our customers with respect to our current or future products may materially and adversely affect us by, for example, causing us to enter into costly royalty arrangements or forcing us to incur settlement or litigation costs.12Return to IndexAs a result of protective provisions in the Company's certificate of incorporation, the voting power of certain officers, directors and principal shareholders may be increased at future meetings of the Company's shareholders.The Company's certificate of incorporation provides that if a shareholder, other than shareholders subject to specific exceptions, acquires (after the date of the Company's 1998 recapitalization) 10% or more of the outstanding Class A common stock and does not own an equal or greater percentage of all then outstanding shares of both Class A and Class B common stock (all of which common stock must have been acquired after the date of the 1998 recapitalization), such shareholder must, within 90 days of the trigger date, purchase Class B common shares, in an amount and at a price determined in accordance with a formula described in the Company's certificate of incorporation, or forfeit its right to vote its Class A common shares. As of February 28, 2017, to the Company's knowledge, there was one shareholder of the Company's common stock with ownership in excess of 10% of Class A outstanding shares with no ownership of the Company's Class B common stock and with no basis for exception from the operation of the above-mentioned provisions. In order to vote its shares at Bel's next shareholders' meeting, this shareholder must either purchase the required number of Class B common shares or sell or otherwise transfer Class A common shares until its Class A holdings are under 10%. As of February 28, 2017, to the Company's knowledge, this shareholder owned 23.2% of the Company's Class A common stock and had not taken steps to either purchase the required number of Class B common shares or sell or otherwise transfer Class A common shares until its Class A holdings fall below 10%.  Unless and until this situation is satisfied in a manner permitted by the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the subject shareholder will not be permitted to vote its shares of common stock. To the extent that the voting rights of particular holders of Class A common stock are suspended as of times when the Company's shareholders vote due to the above-mentioned provisions, such suspension will have the effect of increasing the voting power of those holders of Class A common shares whose voting rights are not suspended.  As of February 28, 2017, Daniel Bernstein, the Company's chief executive officer, beneficially owned 353,204 Class A common shares (or 21.1%) of the outstanding Class A common shares whose voting rights were not suspended, Howard Bernstein beneficially owned 140,000 Class A common shares (or 8.4%) of the outstanding Class A common shares whose voting rights were not suspended, the Estate of Elliot Bernstein beneficially owned 82,357 Class A common shares (or 4.9%) of the outstanding Class A common shares whose voting rights were not suspended and all directors and executive officers as a group (which includes Daniel Bernstein, but does not include Howard Bernstein or the Estate of Elliot Bernstein) beneficially owned 359,187 Class A common shares (or 21.4%) of the outstanding Class A common shares whose voting rights were not suspended.Cyber risk and the failure to maintain the integrity of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties with which we do business, could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to an increasing number of various types of information technology vulnerabilities, threats and targeted computer crimes which pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers, or cyber-attacks or security breaches of our networks or systems, could result in the loss of customers and business opportunities, legal liability, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, and additional compliance costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we attempt to mitigate these risks, our systems, networks, products, solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced and persistent threats. We also maintain and have access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer controls. Despite our efforts to protect such sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, our facilities and systems and those of our customers and third-party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches, theft, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors that could lead to the compromising of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, improper use of our systems, software solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.As a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to a number of procurement rules and regulations.We must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the award, administration, and performance of U.S. Government contracts. Government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and, in some instances, impose added costs on our business. A violation of specific laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties or the termination of our contracts or debarment from bidding on contracts. These fines and penalties could be imposed for failing to follow procurement integrity and bidding rules, employing improper billing practices or otherwise failing to follow cost accounting standards, receiving or paying kickbacks, or filing false claims. We have been, and expect to continue to be, subjected to audits and investigations by government agencies. The failure to comply with the terms of our government contracts could harm our business reputation. It could also result in our progress payments being withheld.13Return to IndexIn some instances, these laws and regulations impose terms or rights that are more favorable to the government than those typically available to commercial parties in negotiated transactions. For example, the U.S. Government may terminate any of our government contracts and, in general, subcontracts, at its convenience as well as for default based on performance. Upon termination for convenience of a fixed-price type contract, we normally are entitled to receive the purchase price for delivered items, reimbursement for allowable costs for work-in-process, and an allowance for profit on work actually completed on the contract or adjustment for loss if completion of performance would have resulted in a loss. Upon termination for convenience of a Federal Government cost reimbursement contract, we normally are entitled to reimbursement of allowable costs plus a portion of the fee. Such allowable costs would normally include our cost to terminate agreements with our suppliers and subcontractors. The amount of the fee recovered, if any, is related to the portion of the work accomplished prior to termination and is determined by negotiation"
8,BELFB,BEL FUSE INC,2016-03-11,"  Risk Factors
The risks described below should be carefully considered before making an investment decision. These are the risk factors that we consider to be the most significant risk factors, but they are not the only risk factors that should be considered in making an investment decision. This Form 10-K also contains Forward-Looking Statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See the ""Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Information,"" above. Our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of the risk factors described below, under ""Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Information"" or with respect to specific Forward-Looking Statements presented herein. The trading price of our securities could decline due to any of these risks, and investors in our securities may lose all or part of their investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business in the future.We conduct business in a highly competitive industry.Our business is largely in a highly competitive worldwide industry, with relatively low barriers to competitive entry. We compete principally on the basis of product performance, quality, reliability, depth of product line, customer service, technological innovation, design, delivery time and price. The industry in which we operate has become increasingly concentrated and globalized in recent years and our major competitors, some of which are larger than Bel, have significant financial resources and technological capabilities.We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.Our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to effect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our credit agreement restricts our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due.In addition, we conduct a substantial portion of our operations through our subsidiaries, certain of which are not guarantors of our indebtedness. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Unless they are guarantors of our indebtedness, our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity, and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. While the indenture governing certain of our senior notes, these notes and the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us, these limitations are subject to qualifications and exceptions. In the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness.Our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations.If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default, the lenders under the credit agreement could terminate their commitments to loan money, the lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.Our high level of indebtedness could negatively impact our access to the capital markets and our ability to satisfy financial covenants under our existing credit agreement.We incurred substantial amounts of indebtedness to fund the acquisitions of Power Solutions and Connectivity Solutions in 2014, and we may need to incur additional indebtedness to finance operations or for other general corporate purposes.  Our consolidated principal amount of outstanding indebtedness was $187.2 million at December 31, 2015, resulting in a leverage ratio of 2.98x adjusted EBITDA, as calculated in accordance with our credit agreement.  Accordingly, our debt service requirements are significant in relation to our net sales and cash flow.  This leverage exposes us to risk in the event of downturns in our business, in our industry or in the economy generally, and may impair our operating flexibility and our ability to compete effectively.  Our current credit agreement requires us to maintain a certain covenant leverage ratio, and the ratio becomes more restrictive at set levels during the term.  If we do not continue to satisfy this required ratio or receive waivers from our lenders, we will be in default under the credit agreement, which could result in an accelerated maturity of our debt obligations.-7-Return to IndexOur backlog figures may not be reliable indicators.Many of the orders that comprise our backlog may be delayed, accelerated or canceled by customers without penalty. Customers may on occasion double order from multiple sources to ensure timely delivery when leadtimes are particularly long. Customers often cancel orders when business is weak and inventories are excessive.  Therefore, we cannot be certain that the amount of our backlog equals or exceeds the level of orders that will ultimately be delivered. Our results of operations could be adversely impacted if customers cancel a material portion of orders in our backlog.There are several factors which can cause us to lower our prices or otherwise cause our margins to suffer.Our prices and/or margins could be substantially impacted by the following factors:a)      The average selling prices for our products tend to decrease over their life cycles, and customers put pressure on suppliers to lower prices even when production costs are increasing. Our profits suffer if we are not able to reduce our costs of production, introduce technological innovations as sales prices decline, or pass through cost increases to customers.b)      Any drop in demand for our products or increase in supply of competitive products could cause a dramatic drop in our average sales prices which in turn could result in a decrease in our gross margins.  A shift in product mix could also have an unfavorable or favorable impact on our gross margins, depending upon the underlying raw material content and labor requirements of the associated products.c)      Increased competition from low cost suppliers around the world has put further pressures on pricing.  We continually strive to lower our costs, negotiate better pricing for components and raw materials and improve our operating efficiencies.  Profit margins will be materially and adversely impacted if we are not able to reduce our costs of production or introduce technological innovations when sales prices decline.Our annual effective income tax rate can change materially as a result of changes in our mix of U.S. and foreign earnings and other factors, including changes in tax laws and changes made by regulatory authorities.Our overall effective income tax rate is equal to our total tax expense as a percentage of total earnings before tax. However, income tax expense and benefits are not recognized on a global basis but rather on a jurisdictional or legal entity basis. Losses in one jurisdiction may not be used to offset profits in other jurisdictions and may cause an increase in our tax rate. Changes in statutory tax rates and laws, as well as ongoing audits by domestic and international authorities, could affect the amount of income taxes and other taxes paid by us. For example, legislative proposals to change U.S. taxation of non-U.S. earnings could increase our effective tax rate. Also, changes in the mix of earnings (or losses) between jurisdictions and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes, among other factors, could have a significant effect on our overall effective income tax rate. In addition, our effective tax rate would increase if we were unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions, or if we were otherwise required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets.We are subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions. As a result, any adverse development in the tax laws of any of these jurisdictions or any disagreement with our tax positions could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations.We are subject to taxation in, and to the tax laws and regulations of, multiple jurisdictions as a result of the international scope of our operations and our corporate and financing structure. We are also subject to transfer pricing laws with respect to our intercompany transactions, including those relating to the flow of funds among our companies. Adverse developments in these laws or regulations, or any change in position regarding the application, administration or interpretation thereof, in any applicable jurisdiction, could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or results of our operations. In addition, the tax authorities in any applicable jurisdiction, including the United States, may disagree with the positions we have taken or intend to take regarding the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions. If any applicable tax authorities, including U.S. tax authorities, were to successfully challenge the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of our operations.-8-Return to Index In the PRC, we are challenged to match availability of workers and maintain leadtimes in line with customer demand for certain of our products, which demand has been highly volatile in recent years.  This volatility can materially adversely affect Bel's results.In the PRC, the availability of labor is cyclical and is significantly affected by the migration of workers in relation to the annual Lunar New Year holiday as well as economic conditions in the PRC.  In addition, we have little visibility into the ordering habits of our customers and can be subjected to large and unpredictable variations in demand for our products.  Accordingly, we must continually recruit and train new workers to replace those lost to attrition each year and to address peaks in demand that may occur from time to time.  These recruiting and training efforts and related inefficiences, as well as overtime required in order to meet demand, can add volatility to the costs incurred by the Company for labor in the PRC. We are dependent on our ability to develop new products.Our future operating results are dependent, in part, on our ability to develop, produce and market new and more technologically advanced products. There are numerous risks inherent in this process, including the risks that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to timely develop and bring to market new products and applications to meet customers' changing needs.Our acquisitions may not produce the anticipated results.A significant portion of our growth has been attributable to acquisitions. We cannot assure that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future. If an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our other businesses, our results of operations, enterprise value, market value and prospects could all be materially and adversely affected.  Integration of new acquisitions into our consolidated operations may result in lower average operating results for the group as a whole, and may divert management's focus from the ongoing operations of the Company during the integration period.Our strategy also focuses on the reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses through the integration or elimination of redundant sales facilities and administrative functions at acquired companies. The Company completed two acquisitions in 2013 and two acquisitions in 2014, as previously described in Item 1 of this Form 10-K.  If we are unable to achieve our expectations with respect to these or future acquisitions, such inability could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations.  In connection with the 2013 Acquisitions, we have recorded $4.8 million of goodwill and $7.6 million of other intangible assets.  In addition, we have recorded $105.4 million of goodwill and $73.2 million of other intangible assets in connection with the 2014 Acquisitions.  If our acquisitions fail to perform up to our expectations, or if the value of goodwill or other intangible assets decreases as a result of weakened economic conditions, we could be required to record a non-cash loss from the impairment of these assets.We may not achieve all of the expected benefits from our restructuring programs.We have implemented a number of restructuring programs in the last few years. These programs include various cost savings, the consolidation of certain facilities and the reduction of headcount. We have made certain assumptions in estimating the anticipated savings we expect to achieve under such programs, which include the estimated savings from the elimination of certain headcount and the consolidation of facilities. These assumptions may turn out to be incorrect due to a variety of factors. In addition, our ability to realize the expected benefits from these programs is subject to significant business, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unsuccessful in implementing these programs or if we do not achieve our expected results, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected or our business operations could be disrupted.The global nature of our operations exposes us to numerous risks that could materially adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.We operate in 15 countries, and our products are distributed in those countries as well as in other parts of the world. A large portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside of the United States and a large portion of our net sales are generated outside of the United States. Operations outside of the United States, particularly operations in developing regions, are subject to various risks that may not be present or as significant for our U.S. operations. Economic uncertainty in some of the geographic regions in which we operate, including developing regions, could result in the disruption of commerce and negatively impact cash flows from our operations in those areas.Risks inherent in our international operations include: • foreign currency exchange controls and tax rates; • foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, including devaluations; • the potential for changes in regional and local economic conditions, including local inflationary pressures; -9-Return to Index• restrictive governmental actions such as those on transfer or repatriation of funds and trade protection matters, including antidumping duties, tariffs, embargoes and prohibitions or restrictions on acquisitions or joint ventures; • changes in laws and regulations, including the laws and policies of the United States affecting trade and foreign investment; • the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems; • variations in protection of intellectual property and other legal rights; • more expansive legal rights of foreign unions or works councils; • changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; • social plans that prohibit or increase the cost of certain restructuring actions; • the potential for nationalization of enterprises or facilities; and • unsettled political conditions and possible terrorist attacks against U.S. or other interests.In addition, there are potential tax inefficiencies and tax costs in repatriating funds from our non-U.S. subsidiaries.These and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our international operations and, consequently, on our consolidated financial condition or consolidated results of operations. The loss of certain substantial customers could materially and adversely affect us. During the year ended December 31, 2015, sales to one direct customer exceeded 10% of our consolidated net sales. Hon Hai Precision Industry Company Ltd., a contract manufacturer utilized by various end customers, represented 13.2% of our 2015 consolidated net sales. We believe that the loss of this customer could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations.  We have experienced significant concentrations in prior years. See Note 12, ""Segments"" for additional disclosures related to our significant customers.We may experience labor unrest.As we implement transfers of certain of our operations, we may experience strikes or other types of labor unrest as a result of lay-offs or termination of employees in higher labor cost countries.  Our manufacturing facilities in New York State, the United Kingdom and Mexico are represented by labor unions and substantially all of our factory workers in the PRC are represented by government-sponsored unions.We may experience labor shortages.Government, economic, social and labor policies in the PRC may cause shortages of factory labor in areas where we have some of our products manufactured.  If we are required to manufacture more of these products outside of the PRC as a result of such shortages, our margins will likely be materially adversely affected.Our results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted by environmental and other regulations.Our manufacturing operations, products and/or product packaging are subject to environmental laws and regulations governing air emissions; wastewater discharges; the handling, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances, wastes and certain chemicals used or generated in our manufacturing processes; employee health and safety labeling or other notifications with respect to the content or other aspects of our processes, products or packaging; restrictions on the use of certain materials in or on design aspects of our products or product packaging; and, responsibility for disposal of products or product packaging. More stringent environmental regulations may be enacted in the future, and we cannot presently determine the modifications, if any, in our operations that any such future regulations might require, or the cost of compliance with these regulations. We may face risks relating to climate change that could have an adverse impact on our business. Greenhouse gas (""GHG"") emissions have increasingly become the subject of substantial international, national, regional, state and local attention.  GHG emission regulations have been promulgated in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate, and additional GHG requirements are in various stages of development.  Such measures could require us to modify existing or obtain new permits, implement additional pollution control technology, curtail operations or increase our operating costs.  Any additional regulation of GHG emissions, including a cap-and-trade system, technology mandate, emissions tax, reporting requirement or other program, could materially adversely affect our business. -10-Return to IndexRegulations related to conflict minerals will cause the Company to incur additional expenses and may have other adverse consequences.The SEC has adopted inquiry, diligence and additional disclosure requirements related to certain minerals sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and surrounding countries, or ""conflict minerals"", that are necessary to the functionality of a product manufactured, or contracted to be manufactured, by an SEC reporting company. The minerals that the rules cover are commonly referred to as ""3TG"" and include tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold. As a public company, Bel was required to make its first filing under these new rules on May 31, 2014.  In such filing, Bel described the due diligence it had undertaken of its suppliers in an effort to determine the source of any conflict minerals used in its products or components.  These due diligence requirements are ongoing, and Bel will continue to incur additional costs, which could be substantial, related to its due diligence and compliance process.  In addition, the Company's supply chain is complex, and if it is not able to determine with certainty the source and chain of custody for all conflict minerals used in its products that are sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and surrounding countries or determine that its products are ""conflict free"", then the Company may face reputational challenges with customers, investors or others.  As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering ""conflict free"" minerals, if the Company chooses to use only conflict minerals that are ""conflict free"" in its products and components, the Company cannot be sure that it will be able to obtain necessary materials from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices.     Our results may vary substantially from period to period.Our revenues and expenses may vary significantly from one accounting period to another accounting period due to a variety of factors, including customers' buying decisions, our product mix, the volatility of raw material costs, the impact of competition, the impact of the Chinese New Year and general market and economic conditions.  Such variations could significantly impact our stock price.A shortage of availability or an increase in the cost of high-quality raw materials, components and other resources may adversely impact our ability to procure these items at cost effective prices and thus may negatively impact profit margins.Our results of operations may be materially adversely impacted by difficulties in obtaining raw materials, supplies, power, labor, natural resources and any other items needed for the production of our products, as well as by the effects of quality deviations in raw materials and the effects of significant fluctuations in the prices of existing inventories and purchase commitments for these materials.  Many of these materials and components are produced by a limited number of suppliers and their availability to us may be constrained by supplier capacity.As product life cycles shorten and during periods of market slowdowns, the risk of materials obsolescence increases and this may materially and adversely impact our financial results.Rapid shifts in demand for various products may cause some of our inventory of raw materials, components or finished goods to become obsolete.The life cycles and demand for our products are directly linked to the life cycles and demand for the end products into which they are designed.  Rapid shifts in the life cycles or demand for these end products due to technological shifts, economic conditions or other market trends may result in material amounts of either raw materials or finished goods inventory becoming obsolete.   While the Company works diligently to manage inventory levels, rapid shifts in demand may result in obsolete or excess inventory and materially adversely impact financial results.A loss of the services of the Company's executive officers or other skilled associates could negatively impact our operations and results.The success of the Company's operations is largely dependent upon the performance of its executive officers, managers, engineers and sales people.  Many of these individuals have a significant number of years of experience within the Company and/or the industry in which we compete and would be extremely difficult to replace.  The loss of the services of any of these associates may materially and adversely impact our results of operations if we are unable to replace them in a timely manner.Our stock price, like that of many technology companies, has been and may continue to be volatile.The market price of our common stock may fluctuate as a result of variations in our quarterly operating results and other factors beyond our control.  These fluctuations may be exaggerated if the trading volume of our common stock is low.  The market price of our common stock may rise and fall in response to a variety of other factors, including:·announcements of technological or competitive developments;·general market or economic conditions;·market or economic conditions specific to particular geographical areas in which we operate;·acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or our competitors;·the gain or loss of a significant customer or order; or·changes in estimates of our financial performance or changes in recommendations by securities analysts regarding us or our industry-11-Return to IndexIn addition, equity securities of many technology companies have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations even in periods when the capital markets generally are not distressed.  These price and volume fluctuations often have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies.Our intellectual property rights may not be adequately protected under the current state of the law.Our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights through patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and in other countries may not prevent misappropriation, and our failure to protect our proprietary rights could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and future prospects. A third party could, without authorization, copy or otherwise appropriate our proprietary information. Our agreements with employees and others who participate in development activities could be breached, we may not have adequate remedies for any breach, and our trade secrets may otherwise become known or independently developed by competitors.We may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights and we may incur defense costs and possibly royalty obligations or lose the right to use technology important to our business.From time to time, we receive claims by third parties asserting that our products violate their intellectual property rights.  Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be time consuming and expensive to litigate or settle and could divert management attention from administering our business.  A third party asserting infringement claims against us or our customers with respect to our current or future products may materially and adversely affect us by, for example, causing us to enter into costly royalty arrangements or forcing us to incur settlement or litigation costs.As a result of protective provisions in the Company's certificate of incorporation, the voting power of certain officers, directors and principal shareholders may be increased at future meetings of the Company's shareholders.The Company's certificate of incorporation provides that if a shareholder, other than shareholders subject to specific exceptions, acquires (after the date of the Company's 1998 recapitalization) 10% or more of the outstanding Class A common stock and does not own an equal or greater percentage of all then outstanding shares of both Class A and Class B common stock (all of which common stock must have been acquired after the date of the 1998 recapitalization), such shareholder must, within 90 days of the trigger date, purchase Class B common shares, in an amount and at a price determined in accordance with a formula described in the Company's certificate of incorporation, or forfeit its right to vote its Class A common shares. As of February 29, 2016, to the Company's knowledge, there was one shareholder of the Company's common stock with ownership in excess of 10% of Class A outstanding shares with no ownership of the Company's Class B common stock and with no basis for exception from the operation of the above-mentioned provisions. In order to vote its shares at Bel's next shareholders' meeting, this shareholder must either purchase the required number of Class B common shares or sell or otherwise transfer Class A common shares until its Class A holdings are under 10%. As of February 29, 2016, to the Company's knowledge, this shareholder owned 23.1% of the Company's Class A common stock and had not taken steps to either purchase the required number of Class B common shares or sell or otherwise transfer Class A common shares until its Class A holdings fall below 10%.  Unless and until this situation is satisfied in a manner permitted by the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the subject shareholder will not be permitted to vote its shares of common stock. To the extent that the voting rights of particular holders of Class A common stock are suspended as of times when the Company's shareholders vote due to the above-mentioned provisions, such suspension will have the effect of increasing the voting power of those holders of Class A common shares whose voting rights are not suspended.  As of February 29, 2016, Daniel Bernstein, the Company's chief executive officer, beneficially owned 353,204 Class A common shares (or 21.1%) of the outstanding Class A common shares whose voting rights were not suspended, the Estate of Elliot Bernstein beneficially owned 82,357 Class A common shares (or 4.9%) of the outstanding Class A common shares whose voting rights were not suspended and all directors and executive officers as a group (which includes Daniel Bernstein, but does not include the Estate of Elliot Bernstein) beneficially owned 501,095 Class A common shares (or 29.9%) of the outstanding Class A common shares whose voting rights were not suspended.-12-Return to IndexCyber risk and the failure to maintain the integrity of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties with which we do business, could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations. We could be subject to various types of information technology vulnerabilities, threats and targeted computer crimes which pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers, or cyber-attacks or security breaches of our networks or systems, could result in the loss of customers and business opportunities, legal liability, regulatory fines, penalties or intervention, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensatory costs, and additional compliance costs, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. While we attempt to mitigate these risks, our systems, networks, products, solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced and persistent threats. We also maintain and have access to sensitive, confidential or personal data or information in certain of our businesses that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and customer controls. Despite our efforts to protect such sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, our facilities and systems and those of our customers and third-party service providers may be vulnerable to security breaches, theft, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors that could lead to the compromising of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, improper use of our systems, software solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.As a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to a number of procurement rules and regulations.We must comply with and are affected by laws and regulations relating to the award, administration, and performance of U.S. Government contracts. Government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and, in some instances, impose added costs on our business. A violation of specific laws and regulations could result in the imposition of fines and penalties or the termination of our contracts or debarment from bidding on contracts. These fines and penalties could be imposed for failing to follow procurement integrity and bidding rules, employing improper billing practices or otherwise failing to follow cost accounting standards, receiving or paying kickbacks, or filing false claims. We have been, and expect to continue to be, subjected to audits and investigations by government agencies. The failure to comply with the terms of our government contracts could harm our business reputation. It could also result in our progress payments being withheld.In some instances, these laws and regulations impose terms or rights that are more favorable to the government than those typically available to commercial parties in negotiated transactions. For example, the U.S. Government may terminate any of our government contracts and, in general, subcontracts, at its convenience as well as for default based on performance. Upon termination for convenience of a fixed-price type contract, we normally are entitled to receive the purchase price for delivered items, reimbursement for allowable costs for work-in-process, and an allowance for profit on work actually completed on the contract or adjustment for loss if completion of performance would have resulted in a loss. Upon termination for convenience of a Federal Government cost reimbursement contract, we normally are entitled to reimbursement of allowable costs plus a portion of the fee. Such allowable costs would normally include our cost to terminate agreements with our suppliers and subcontractors. The amount of the fee recovered, if any, is related to the portion of the work accomplished prior to termination and is determined by negotiation"
10,BELFB,BEL FUSE INC,2015-03-13,"  Risk Factors
The risks described below should be carefully considered before making an investment decision. These are the risk factors that we consider to be the most significant risk factors, but they are not the only risk factors that should be considered in making an investment decision. This Form 10-K also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. See the ""Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements,"" above. Our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of the risk factors described below, under ""Cautionary Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements"" or with respect to specific forward-looking statements presented herein. The trading price of our securities could decline due to any of these risks, and investors in our securities may lose all or part of their investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business in the future.We conduct business in a highly competitive industry.Our business is largely in a highly competitive worldwide industry, with relatively low barriers to competitive entry. We compete principally on the basis of product performance, quality, reliability, depth of product line, customer service, technological innovation, design, delivery time and price. The industry in which we operate has become increasingly concentrated and globalized in recent years and our major competitors, some of which are larger than Bel, have significant financial resources and technological capabilities.We may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.Our ability to make scheduled payments on or refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. We may be unable to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity capital or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to effect any such alternative measures on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, those alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our credit agreement restricts our ability to dispose of assets and use the proceeds from those dispositions and may also restrict our ability to raise debt or equity capital to be used to repay other indebtedness when it becomes due. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain proceeds in an amount sufficient to meet any debt service obligations then due.In addition, we conduct a substantial portion of our operations through our subsidiaries, certain of which are not guarantors of our indebtedness. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness is dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Unless they are guarantors of our indebtedness, our subsidiaries do not have any obligation to pay amounts due on indebtedness or to make funds available for that purpose. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity, and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. While the indenture governing certain of our senior notes, these notes and the credit agreement governing the senior secured credit facilities limit the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us, these limitations are subject to qualifications and exceptions. In the event that we do not receive distributions from our subsidiaries, we may be unable to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness.Our inability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations, or to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all, would materially and adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations.If we cannot make scheduled payments on our debt, we will be in default, the lenders under the credit agreement could terminate their commitments to loan money, the lenders could foreclose against the assets securing their borrowings and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.Our high level of indebtedness could negatively impact our access to the capital markets and our ability to satisfy financial covenants under our existing credit agreement.We have incurred substantial amounts of indebtedness to fund the acquisitions of Power Solutions and Connectivity Solutions in 2014, and we may need to incur additional indebtedness to finance operations or for other general corporate purposes.  Our consolidated principal amount of outstanding indebtedness was $233.1 million at December 31, 2014, resulting in a leverage ratio of 3.51x adjusted EBITDA, as calculated in accordance with our credit agreement.  Accordingly, our debt service requirements are significant in relation to our net sales and cash flow.  This leverage exposes us to risk in the event of downturns in our business, in our industry or in the economy generally, and may impair our operating flexibility and our ability to compete effectively.  Our current credit agreement requires us to maintain a certain covenant leverage ratio.  If we do not continue to satisfy this required ratio or receive waivers from our lenders, we will be in default under the credit agreement, which could result in an accelerated maturity of our debt obligations.-7-Return to IndexOur backlog figures may not be reliable indicators.Many of the orders that comprise our backlog may be delayed, accelerated or canceled by customers without penalty. Customers may on occasion double order from multiple sources to ensure timely delivery when leadtimes are particularly long. Customers often cancel orders when business is weak and inventories are excessive.  Therefore, we cannot be certain that the amount of our backlog equals or exceeds the level of orders that will ultimately be delivered. Our results of operations could be adversely impacted if customers cancel a material portion of orders in our backlog.There are several factors which can cause us to lower our prices or otherwise cause our margins to suffer.Our prices and/or margins could be substantially impacted by the following factors:a)      The average selling prices for our products tend to decrease rapidly over their life cycles, and customers are increasingly putting pressure on suppliers to lower prices even when production costs are increasing. Our profits suffer if we are not able to reduce our costs of production, introduce technological innovations as sales prices decline, or pass through cost increases to customers.b)      Any drop in demand for our products or increase in supply of competitive products could cause a dramatic drop in our average sales prices which in turn could result in a decrease in our gross margins.  A shift in product mix could also have an unfavorable or favorable impact on our gross margins, depending upon the underlying raw material content and labor requirements of the associated products.c)      Increased competition from low cost suppliers around the world has put further pressures on pricing.  We continually strive to lower our costs, negotiate better pricing for components and raw materials and improve our operating efficiencies.  Profit margins will be materially and adversely impacted if we are not able to reduce our costs of production or introduce technological innovations when sales prices decline.Our annual effective income tax rate can change materially as a result of changes in our mix of U.S. and foreign earnings and other factors, including changes in tax laws and changes made by regulatory authorities.Our overall effective income tax rate is equal to our total tax expense as a percentage of total earnings before tax. However, income tax expense and benefits are not recognized on a global basis but rather on a jurisdictional or legal entity basis. Losses in one jurisdiction may not be used to offset profits in other jurisdictions and may cause an increase in our tax rate. Income tax provision changes in statutory tax rates and laws, as well as ongoing audits by domestic and international authorities, could affect the amount of income taxes and other taxes paid by us. For example, legislative proposals to change U.S. taxation of non-U.S. earnings could increase our effective tax rate. Also, changes in the mix of earnings (or losses) between jurisdictions and assumptions used in the calculation of income taxes, among other factors, could have a significant effect on our overall effective income tax rate. In addition, our effective tax rate would increase if we were unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions, or if we were otherwise required to increase our valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets.We are subject to taxation in multiple jurisdictions. As a result, any adverse development in the tax laws of any of these jurisdictions or any disagreement with our tax positions could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or results of operations.We are subject to taxation in, and to the tax laws and regulations of, multiple jurisdictions as a result of the international scope of our operations and our corporate and financing structure. We are also subject to transfer pricing laws with respect to our intercompany transactions, including those relating to the flow of funds among our companies. Adverse developments in these laws or regulations, or any change in position regarding the application, administration or interpretation thereof, in any applicable jurisdiction, could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or results of our operations. In addition, the tax authorities in any applicable jurisdiction, including the United States, may disagree with the positions we have taken or intend to take regarding the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions. If any applicable tax authorities, including U.S. tax authorities, were to successfully challenge the tax treatment or characterization of any of our transactions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition or results of our operations.  -8-Return to Index  In the PRC, we are challenged to match availability of workers and maintain leadtimes in line with customer demand for certain of our products, which demand has been highly volatile in recent years.  This volatility can materially adversely affect Bel's results.  In the PRC, the availability of labor is cyclical and is significantly affected by the migration of workers in relation to the annual Lunar New Year holiday as well as economic conditions in the PRC.  In addition, we have little visibility into the ordering habits of our customers and can be subjected to large and unpredictable variations in demand for our products.  Accordingly, we must continually recruit and train new workers to replace those lost to attrition each year and to address peaks in demand that may occur from time to time.  These recruiting and training efforts and related inefficiencies, as well as overtime required in order to meet demand, can add volatility to the costs incurred by the Company for labor in the PRC. We are dependent on our ability to develop new products.Our future operating results are dependent, in part, on our ability to develop, produce and market new and more technologically advanced products. There are numerous risks inherent in this process, including the risks that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to timely develop and bring to market new products and applications to meet customers' changing needs. Our acquisitions may not produce the anticipated results.A significant portion of our growth is from acquisitions. We cannot assure that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future. If an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our other businesses, our results of operations, enterprise value, market value and prospects could all be materially and adversely affected.  Integration of new acquisitions into our consolidated operations may result in lower average operating results for the group as a whole, and may divert management's focus from the ongoing operations of the Company during the integration period.Our strategy also focuses on the reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses through the integration or elimination of redundant sales facilities and administrative functions at acquired companies. The Company completed three acquisitions in 2012, two acquisitions in 2013 and two acquisitions in 2014, as previously described in Item 1 of this Form 10-K.  If we are unable to achieve our expectations with respect to these or future acquisitions, such inability could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations.  In connection with the 2012 and 2013 Acquisitions, we have recorded $13.9 million of goodwill and $19.2 million of other intangible assets.  In addition, we have recorded a provisional amount of goodwill and other intangible assets of $100.0 million and $73.2 million, respectively, in connection with the 2014 Acquisitions.  If our acquisitions fail to perform up to our expectations, or if the value of goodwill or other intangible assets decreases as a result of weakened economic conditions, we could be required to record a loss from the impairment of these assets.The global nature of our operations exposes us to numerous risks that could materially adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations.We operate in 15 countries, and our products are distributed in those countries as well as in other parts of the world. A large portion of our manufacturing operations are located outside of the United States and a large portion of our net sales are generated outside of the United States. Operations outside of the United States, particularly operations in developing regions, are subject to various risks that may not be present or as significant for our U.S. operations. Economic uncertainty in some of the geographic regions in which we operate, including developing regions, could result in the disruption of commerce and negatively impact cash flows from our operations in those areas.Risks inherent in our international operations include: • foreign currency exchange controls and tax rates; • foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, including devaluations; • the potential for changes in regional and local economic conditions, including local inflationary pressures; • restrictive governmental actions such as those on transfer or repatriation of funds and trade protection matters, including antidumping duties, tariffs, embargoes and prohibitions or restrictions on acquisitions or joint ventures; • changes in laws and regulations, including the laws and policies of the United States affecting trade and foreign investment; • the difficulty of enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems; • variations in protection of intellectual property and other legal rights; • more expansive legal rights of foreign unions or works councils; • changes in labor conditions and difficulties in staffing and managing international operations; • social plans that prohibit or increase the cost of certain restructuring actions; • the potential for nationalization of enterprises or facilities; and • unsettled political conditions and possible terrorist attacks against U.S. or other interests.-9-Return to IndexIn addition, there are potential tax inefficiencies and tax costs in repatriating funds from our non-U.S. subsidiaries.These and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our international operations and, consequently, on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. The loss of certain substantial customers could materially and adversely affect us. During the year ended December 31, 2014, sales to one direct customer exceeded 10% of our consolidated revenue. Hon Hai Precision Industry Company Ltd., a contract manufacturer utilized by various end customers, represented 15.7% of our revenue. We believe that the loss of this customer could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations.  We have experienced significant concentrations in prior years. See Note 12 of the notes to the Company's consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures related to our significant customers. We may experience labor unrest.As we implement transfers of certain of our operations, we may experience strikes or other types of labor unrest as a result of lay-offs or termination of employees in higher labor cost countries.  Our manufacturing facilities in New York, the United Kingdom and Mexico are represented by labor unions and substantially all of our factory workers in the PRC are represented by government-sponsored unions.We may experience labor shortages.Government economic, social and labor policies in the PRC may cause shortages of factory labor in areas where we have some of our products manufactured.  If we are required to manufacture more of these products outside of the PRC as a result of such shortages, our margins will likely be materially adversely affected.Our results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted by environmental and other regulations.Our manufacturing operations, products and/or product packaging are subject to environmental laws and regulations governing air emissions; wastewater discharges; the handling, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances, wastes and certain chemicals used or generated in our manufacturing processes; employee health and safety labeling or other notifications with respect to the content or other aspects of our processes, products or packaging; restrictions on the use of certain materials in or on design aspects of our products or product packaging; and, responsibility for disposal of products or product packaging. More stringent environmental regulations may be enacted in the future, and we cannot presently determine the modifications, if any, in our operations that any such future regulations might require, or the cost of compliance with these regulations. We may face risks relating to climate change that could have an adverse impact on our business.  Greenhouse gas (""GHG"") emissions have increasingly become the subject of substantial international, national, regional, state and local attention.  GHG emission regulations have been promulgated in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate, and additional GHG requirements are in various stages of development.  Such measures could require us to modify existing or obtain new permits, implement additional pollution control technology, curtail operations or increase our operating costs.  Any additional regulation of GHG emissions, including a cap-and-trade system, technology mandate, emissions tax, reporting requirement or other program, could materially adversely affect our business. New regulations related to conflict minerals will cause the Company to incur additional expenses and may have other adverse consequences.The SEC adopted inquiry, diligence and additional disclosure requirements related to certain minerals sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and surrounding countries, or ""conflict minerals"", that are necessary to the functionality of a product manufactured, or contracted to be manufactured, by an SEC reporting company. The minerals that the rules cover are commonly referred to as ""3TG"" and include tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold. As a public company, Bel was required to make its first filing under these new rules on May 31, 2014.  In such filing, Bel described the due diligence it had undertaken of its suppliers in an effort to determine the source of any conflict minerals used in its products or components.  These due diligence requirements are ongoing, and Bel will continue to incur additional costs, which could be substantial, related to its due diligence and compliance process.  In addition, the Company's supply chain is complex, and if it is not able to determine with certainty the source and chain of custody for all conflict minerals used in its products that are sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and surrounding countries or determine that its products are ""conflict free"", then the Company may face reputational challenges with customers, investors or others.  As there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering ""conflict free"" minerals, if the Company chooses to use only conflict minerals that are ""conflict free"" in its products and components, the Company cannot be sure that it will be able to obtain necessary materials from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices.     -10-Return to IndexOur results may vary substantially from period to period.Our revenues and expenses may vary significantly from one accounting period to another accounting period due to a variety of factors, including customers' buying decisions, our product mix, the volatility of raw material costs, the impact of competition, the impact of the Chinese New Year and general market and economic conditions.  Such variations could significantly impact our stock price.A shortage of availability or an increase in the cost of high-quality raw materials, components and other resources may adversely impact our ability to procure these items at cost effective prices and thus may negatively impact profit margins.Our results of operations may be materially adversely impacted by difficulties in obtaining raw materials, supplies, power, labor, natural resources and any other items needed for the production of our products, as well as by the effects of quality deviations in raw materials and the effects of significant fluctuations in the prices of existing inventories and purchase commitments for these materials.  Many of these materials and components are produced by a limited number of suppliers and their availability to us may be constrained by supplier capacity.As product life cycles shorten and during periods of market slowdowns, the risk of materials obsolescence increases and this may materially and adversely impact our financial results.Rapid shifts in demand for various products may cause some of our inventory of raw materials, components or finished goods to become obsolete.The life cycles and demand for our products are directly linked to the life cycles and demand for the end products into which they are designed.  Rapid shifts in the life cycles or demand for these end products due to technological shifts, economic conditions or other market trends may result in material amounts of either raw materials or finished goods inventory becoming obsolete.   While the Company works diligently to manage inventory levels, rapid shifts in demand may result in obsolete or excess inventory and materially adversely impact financial results.A loss of the services of the Company's executive officers or other skilled associates could negatively impact our operations and results.The success of the Company's operations is largely dependent upon the performance of its executive officers, managers, engineers and sales people.  Many of these individuals have a significant number of years of experience within the Company and/or the industry in which we compete and would be extremely difficult to replace.  The loss of the services of any of these associates may materially and adversely impact our results of operations if we are unable to replace them in a timely manner.Our stock price, like that of many technology companies, has been and may continue to be volatile.The market price of our common stock may fluctuate as a result of variations in our quarterly operating results and other factors beyond our control.  These fluctuations may be exaggerated if the trading volume of our common stock is low.  The market price of our common stock may rise and fall in response to a variety of other factors, including:·announcements of technological or competitive developments;·general market or economic conditions;·market or economic conditions specific to particular geographical areas in which we operate;·acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or our competitors;·the gain or loss of a significant customer or order; or·changes in estimates of our financial performance or changes in recommendations by securities analysts regarding us or our industryIn addition, equity securities of many technology companies have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations even in periods when the capital markets generally are not distressed.  These price and volume fluctuations often have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies.Our intellectual property rights may not be adequately protected under the current state of the law.Our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights through patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and in other countries may not prevent misappropriation, and our failure to protect our proprietary rights could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and future prospects. A third party could, without authorization, copy or otherwise appropriate our proprietary information. Our agreements with employees and others who participate in development activities could be breached, we may not have adequate remedies for any breach, and our trade secrets may otherwise become known or independently developed by competitors.-11-Return to IndexWe may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights and we may incur defense costs and possibly royalty obligations or lose the right to use technology important to our business.From time to time, we receive claims by third parties asserting that our products violate their intellectual property rights.  Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be time consuming and expensive to litigate or settle and could divert management attention from administering our business.  A third party asserting infringement claims against us or our customers with respect to our current or future products may materially and adversely affect us by, for example, causing us to enter into costly royalty arrangements or forcing us to incur settlement or litigation costs.As a result of protective provisions in the Company's certificate of incorporation, the voting power of certain officers, directors and principal shareholders may be increased at future meetings of the Company's shareholders.The Company's certificate of incorporation provides that if a shareholder, other than shareholders subject to specific exceptions, acquires (after the date of the Company's 1998 recapitalization) 10% or more of the outstanding Class A common stock and does not own an equal or greater percentage of all then outstanding shares of both Class A and Class B common stock (all of which common stock must have been acquired after the date of the 1998 recapitalization), such shareholder must, within 90 days of the trigger date, purchase Class B common shares, in an amount and at a price determined in accordance with a formula described in the Company's certificate of incorporation, or forfeit its right to vote its Class A common shares. As of February 28, 2015, to the Company's knowledge, there were two shareholders of the Company's common stock with ownership in excess of 10% of Class A outstanding shares with no ownership of the Company's Class B common stock and with no basis for exception from the operation of the above-mentioned provisions. In order to vote their respective shares at Bel's next shareholders' meeting, these shareholders must either purchase the required number of Class B common shares or sell or otherwise transfer Class A common shares until their Class A holdings are under 10%. As of February 28, 2015, to the Company's knowledge, these shareholders owned 25.0% and 11.0%, respectively, of the Company's Class A common stock and had not taken steps to either purchase the required number of Class B common shares or sell or otherwise transfer Class A common shares until their Class A holdings fall below 10%.  Unless and until this situation is satisfied in a manner permitted by the Company's Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the subject shareholders will not be permitted to vote their shares of common stock. To the extent that the voting rights of particular holders of Class A common stock are suspended as of times when the Company's shareholders vote due to the above-mentioned provisions, such suspension will have the effect of increasing the voting power of those holders of Class A common shares whose voting rights are not suspended.  As of February 28, 2015, Daniel Bernstein, the Company's chief executive officer, beneficially owned 353,204 Class A common shares (or 25.4%) of the outstanding Class A common shares whose voting rights were not suspended, the Estate of Elliot Bernstein beneficially owned 82,357 Class A common shares (or 5.9%) of the outstanding Class A common shares whose voting rights were not suspended and all directors and executive officers as a group (which includes Daniel Bernstein, but does not include the Estate of Elliot Bernstein) beneficially owned 501,095 Class A common shares (or 35.9%) of the outstanding Class A common shares whose voting rights were not suspended.We are dependent on information technology and our systems and infrastructure face certain risks, including cyber security risks and data leakage risks.We are dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure. Any significant breakdown, invasion, destruction or interruption of these systems by employees, others with authorized access to our systems, or unauthorized persons could negatively affect operations. There is also a risk that we could experience a business interruption, theft of information or reputational damage as a result of a cyber attack, such as an infiltration of a data center, or data leakage of confidential information either internally or at our third-party providers. While we have invested in the protection of our data and information technology to reduce these risks and periodically test the security of our information systems network, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity"
6,BELFB,BEL FUSE INC,2014-03-13,"  Risk Factors
An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk.  Investors should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all other information contained in this Annual Report before making investment decisions with respect to our common stock.  Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business in the future.We do business in a highly competitive industry.Our business is largely in a highly competitive worldwide industry, with relatively low barriers to competitive entry. We compete principally on the basis of product performance, quality, reliability, depth of product line, customer service, technological innovation, design, delivery time and price. The industry in which we operate has become increasingly concentrated and globalized in recent years and our major competitors, some of which are larger than Bel, have significant financial resources and technological capabilities.Our backlog figures may not be reliable indicators.Many of the orders that comprise our backlog may be delayed, accelerated or canceled by customers without penalty. Customers may on occasion double order from multiple sources to ensure timely delivery when leadtimes are particularly long. Customers often cancel orders when business is weak and inventories are excessive.  Therefore, we cannot be certain that the amount of our backlog equals or exceeds the level of orders that will ultimately be delivered. Our results of operations could be adversely impacted if customers cancel a material portion of orders in our backlog.There are several factors which can cause us to lower our prices or otherwise cause our margins to suffer.a)       The average selling prices for our products tend to decrease rapidly over their life cycles, and customers are increasingly putting pressure on suppliers to lower prices even when production costs are increasing. Our profits suffer if we are not able to reduce our costs of production, induce technological innovations as sales prices decline, or pass through cost increases to customers.b)       Any drop in demand or increase in supply of our products could cause a dramatic drop in our average sales prices which in turn could result in a decrease in our gross margins.  A shift in product mix could also have a favorable or unfavorable impact on our gross margins, depending upon the underlying raw material content and labor requirements of the associated products.c)       Increased competition from low cost suppliers around the world has put further pressures on pricing.  We continually strive to lower our costs, negotiate better pricing for components and raw materials and improve our operating efficiencies.  Profit margins will be materially and adversely impacted if we are not able to reduce our costs of production or introduce technological innovations when sales prices decline.In the PRC, we are challenged to match availability of workers and maintain leadtimes in line with customer demand for certain of our products, which has been highly volatile in recent years.  This volatility can materially adversely affect Bel’s results.In the PRC, the availability of labor is cyclical and is significantly affected by the migration of workers in relation to the annual Lunar New Year holiday as well as economic conditions in the PRC.  In addition, we have little visibility into the ordering habits of our customers and can be subjected to large and unpredictable variations in demand for our products.  Accordingly, we must continually recruit and train new workers to replace those lost to attrition each year and to address peaks in demand that may occur from time to time.  These recruiting and training efforts and related inefficiencies, as well as overtime required in order to meet demand, can add volatility to the costs incurred by the Company for labor in the PRC. In 2011, we experienced a softening in customer demand for certain of our products, which resulted in underutilized capacity and lower gross margins, as our fixed costs had a lower absorption rate.  After the 2012 Lunar New Year holiday, there was an increase in customer demand which resulted in the hiring and training of new workers and related inefficiencies.  While Bel was not significantly impacted by this volatility in 2013, it remains as a potential risk for future periods.We are dependent on our ability to develop new products.Our future operating results are dependent, in part, on our ability to develop, produce and market new and more technologically advanced products. There are numerous risks inherent in this process, including the risks that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to timely develop and bring to market new products and applications to meet customers’ changing needs.   -8-Return to IndexOur acquisitions may not produce the anticipated results.A significant portion of our growth is from acquisitions. We cannot assure you that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future. If an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our other businesses, our results of operations, enterprise value, market value and prospects could all be materially and adversely affected.  Integration of new acquisitions into our consolidated operations may result in lower average operating results for the group as a whole, and may divert management’s focus from the ongoing operations of the Company during the integration period.Our strategy also focuses on the reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses through the integration or elimination of redundant sales facilities and administrative functions at acquired companies. The Company completed three acquisitions in 2012 and an additional two acquisitions in 2013, as previously described in the Acquisitions section of this Form 10-K.  If we are unable to achieve our expectations with respect to these or future acquisitions, such inability could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations.  In connection with the 2012 Acquisitions, we have recorded $9.1 million of goodwill and $11.7 million of other intangible assets.  In addition, we have preliminarily recorded $4.6 million of goodwill and $7.6 million of other intangible assets in connection with the 2013 Acquisitions.  If our acquisitions fail to perform up to our expectations, or if the value of goodwill or other intangible assets decreases as a result of weakened economic conditions, we could be required to record a loss from the impairment of these assets.If we were to undertake a substantial acquisition for cash, the acquisition would either be funded with cash on hand or financed in part through bank borrowings or the issuance of public or private debt or equity. The acquisition of the 2012 Acquired Companies was funded with cash on hand and shares of the Company’s Class B common stock.  The acquisition of the 2013 Acquired Companies was funded with cash on hand and borrowings under the Company’s existing credit facility.  If we borrow money to finance future acquisitions, this would likely decrease our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage criteria and could result in the imposition of material restrictive covenants.  Under our existing credit facility, we are required to obtain our lender’s consent for certain additional debt financing and to comply with other covenants, including the application of specific financial ratios, and we may be restricted from paying cash dividends on our capital stock. We cannot assure you that the necessary acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, when required. If we issue a substantial amount of stock either as consideration for or to finance an acquisition, such issuance may dilute existing stockholders’ ownership and may take the form of capital stock having preferences over our existing common stock.We are exposed to weaknesses in domestic and international markets and other risks inherent in foreign trade.We have operations in nine countries around the world outside the United States, and approximately 73% of our revenues during 2013 (up from 64% in 2012) were derived from sales to customers outside the United States. Some of the countries in which we operate have in the past experienced and may continue to experience political, economic, and military instability or unrest, medical epidemic and natural disasters.  These conditions could have a material and adverse impact on our ability to operate in these regions and, depending on the extent and severity of these conditions, could materially and adversely affect our overall financial condition and operating results.Although our operations have traditionally been largely transacted in U.S. dollars or U.S. dollar-linked currencies, recent world financial instability may cause additional foreign currency risks in the countries in which we operate.  The decoupling of the Chinese Renminbi from the U.S. dollar has increased, and will continue to increase, financial risk, particularly with the acquisition of TRP.  The Company also has exposure to foreign currency risks associated with the British Pound and Mexican Peso as the Company has manufacturing operations in Great Britain and Mexico.  The 2012 Acquisitions increased our exposure in Great Britain, the Eurozone and Sweden.Other risks inherent in doing business internationally include: expropriation and nationalization, trade restrictions, transportation delays, and changes in United States laws that may inhibit or restrict our ability to manufacture in or sell to any particular country.  For information regarding risks associated with our presence in Asia, see “Item 2 – Properties” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.While we have benefited from favorable tax treatment in many of the countries where we operate, this situation could change if laws or rules in the United States or those foreign jurisdictions change, incentives are changed or revoked, or we are unable to renew current incentives.The loss of certain substantial customers could materially and adversely affect us.During the year ended December 31, 2013, sales to two customers each exceeded 10% of our consolidated revenue. One such customer  (Hon Hai Precision Industry Company Ltd.) represented 19.2% of our revenue and the other (Flextronics International Ltd.) represented 10.4% of our revenue. We believe that the loss of either of these customers would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  We have experienced significant concentrations in prior years. See Note 12 of the notes to the Company’s consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures related to our significant customers.  -9-Return to IndexThe percentage of our revenues derived from our magnetics business increased to nearly 50% during the year ended December 31, 2013; with a concentration of sales in this product line, our profitability could be disproportionately impacted by negative events that impact our magnetics business.Over the past three years, revenues from our magnetics business have increased from 30% in 2011 to 35% in 2012 and to 49% in 2013, reflecting the growth of our ICM business, primary related to the acquisition of TRP in March 2013.  An increase in concentration in any one of our product lines, including our magnetics product line, exposes us disproportionately to events impacting that product line, and thus could materially adversely impact our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.We may experience labor unrest.As we implement transfers of certain of our operations, we may experience strikes or other types of labor unrest as a result of lay-offs or termination of employees in higher labor cost countries.  Our manufacturing facilities in New York, the United Kingdom and Mexico are represented by labor unions and all factory workers in the PRC are represented by government-sponsored unions.We may experience labor shortages.Government economic, social and labor policies in the PRC may cause shortages of factory labor in areas where we have some of our products manufactured.  If we are required to manufacture more of these products outside of the PRC as a result of such shortages, our margins will likely be materially adversely affected.Our results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted by environmental and other regulations.Our manufacturing operations, products and/or product packaging are subject to environmental laws and regulations governing air emissions; wastewater discharges; the handling, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances, wastes and certain chemicals used or generated in our manufacturing processes; employee health and safety labeling or other notifications with respect to the content or other aspects of our processes, products or packaging; restrictions on the use of certain materials in or on design aspects of our products or product packaging; and, responsibility for disposal of products or product packaging. More stringent environmental regulations may be enacted in the future, and we cannot presently determine the modifications, if any, in our operations that any such future regulations might require, or the cost of compliance with these regulations.We may face risks relating to climate change that could have an adverse impact on our business.Greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions have increasingly become the subject of substantial international, national, regional, state and local attention.  GHG emission regulations have been promulgated in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate, and additional GHG requirements are in various stages of development.  Such measures could require us to modify existing or obtain new permits, implement additional pollution control technology, curtail operations or increase our operating costs.  Any additional regulation of GHG emissions, including a cap-and-trade system, technology mandate, emissions tax, reporting requirement or other program, could adversely affect our business. New regulations related to conflict minerals will cause the Company to incur additional expenses and may have other adverse consequences.The SEC adopted inquiry, diligence and additional disclosure requirements related to certain minerals sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and surrounding countries, or “conflict minerals”, that are necessary to the functionality of a product manufactured, or contracted to be manufactured, by an SEC reporting company. The minerals that the rules cover are commonly referred to as “3TG” and include tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold. These rules became effective in 2013, and they impose a requirement for public companies to make disclosures by May 2014 relating to 2013 activities. Implementation of the new disclosure requirements could affect the sourcing and availability of some of the minerals that the Company uses in the manufacture of its products. The Company’s supply chain is complex, and if it is not able to determine the source and chain of custody for all conflict minerals used in its products that are sourced from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and surrounding countries or determine that its products are “conflict free”, then the Company may face reputational challenges with customers, investors or others. Additionally, as there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering “conflict free” minerals, if the Company chooses to use only conflict minerals that are “conflict free”, the Company cannot be sure that it will be able to obtain necessary materials from such suppliers in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Accordingly, the Company could incur significant costs related to the compliance process, including potential difficulty or added costs in satisfying the disclosure requirements.        -10-Return to IndexOur results may vary substantially from period to period.Our revenues and expenses may vary significantly from one accounting period to another accounting period due to a variety of factors, including customers’ buying decisions, our product mix, the volatility of raw material costs and general market and economic conditions.  Such variations could significantly impact our stock price.A shortage of availability or an increase in the cost of high-quality raw materials, components and other resources may adversely impact our ability to procure these items at cost effective prices and thus may negatively impact profit margins.Our results of operations may be adversely impacted by difficulties in obtaining raw materials, supplies, power, labor, natural resources and any other items needed for the production of our products, as well as by the effects of quality deviations in raw materials and the effects of significant fluctuations in the prices of existing inventories and purchase commitments for these materials.  Many of these materials and components are produced by a limited number of suppliers and may be constrained by supplier capacity.As product life cycles shorten and during periods of market slowdowns, the risk of materials obsolescence increases and this may materially and adversely impact our financial results.Rapid shifts in demand for various products may cause some of our inventory of raw materials, components or finished goods to become obsolete.The life cycles and demand for our products are directly linked to the life cycles and demand for the end products into which they are designed.  Rapid shifts in the life cycles or demand for these end products due to technological shifts, economic conditions or other market trends may result in material amounts of inventory of either raw materials or finished goods becoming obsolete.   While the Company works diligently to manage inventory levels, rapid shifts in demand may result in obsolete or excess inventory and materially impact financial results.A loss of the services of the Company’s executive officers or other skilled associates could negatively impact our operations and results.The success of the Company’s operations is largely dependent upon the performance of its executive officers, managers, engineers and sales people.  Many of these individuals have a significant number of years of experience within the Company and/or the industry in which we compete and would be extremely difficult to replace.  The loss of the services of any of these associates may materially and adversely impact our results of operations if we are unable to replace them in a timely manner.Our stock price, like that of many technology companies, has been and may continue to be volatile.The market price of our common stock may fluctuate as a result of variations in our quarterly operating results and other factors beyond our control.  These fluctuations may be exaggerated if the trading volume of our common stock is low.  The market price of our common stock may rise and fall in response to a variety of other factors, including:·  announcements of technological or competitive developments;·  general market or economic conditions;·  market or economic conditions specific to particular geographical areas in which we operate;·  acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or our competitors;·  the gain or loss of a significant customer or order; or·  changes in estimates of our financial performance or changes in recommendations by securities analysts regarding us or our industryIn addition, equity securities of many technology companies have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations even in periods when the capital markets generally are not distressed.  These price and volume fluctuations often have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies.Our intellectual property rights may not be adequately protected under the current state of the law.We cannot assure you we will be successful in protecting our intellectual property through patent or other laws.  As a result, other companies may be able to develop and market similar products which could materially and adversely affect our business.   -11-Return to IndexWe may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights and we may incur defense costs and possibly royalty obligations or lose the right to use technology important to our business.From time to time, we receive claims by third parties asserting that our products violate their intellectual property rights.  Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be time consuming and expensive to litigate or settle and could divert management attention from administering our business.  A third party asserting infringement claims against us or our customers with respect to our current or future products may materially and adversely affect us by, for example, causing us to enter into costly royalty arrangements or forcing us to incur settlement or litigation costs.   In connection with patent infringement lawsuits discussed in Item 3. Legal Proceedings, the Company incurred expenses of $3.5 million related to lawsuit settlements in 2011.As a result of protective provisions in the Company’s certificate of incorporation, the voting power of certain officers, directors and principal shareholders may be increased at future meetings of the Company’s shareholders.The Company's certificate of incorporation provides that if a shareholder, other than shareholders subject to specific exceptions, acquires (after the date of the Company’s 1998 recapitalization) 10% or more of the outstanding Class A common stock and does not own an equal or greater percentage of all then outstanding shares of both Class A and Class B common stock (all of which common stock must have been acquired after the date of the 1998 recapitalization), such shareholder must, within 90 days of the trigger date, purchase Class B common shares, in an amount and at a price determined in accordance with a formula described in the Company’s certificate of incorporation, or forfeit its right to vote its Class A common shares. As of February 28, 2014, to the Company’s knowledge, there were two shareholders of the Company’s common stock with ownership in excess of 10% of Class A outstanding shares with no ownership of the Company’s Class B common stock and with no basis for exception from the operation of the above-mentioned provisions. In order to vote their respective shares at Bel’s next shareholders’ meeting, these shareholders must either purchase the required number of Class B common shares or sell or otherwise transfer Class A common shares until their Class A holdings are under 10%. As of February 28, 2014, to the Company’s knowledge, these shareholders owned 33.6% and 12.5%, respectively, of the Company’s Class A common stock and had not taken steps to either purchase the required number of Class B common shares or sell or otherwise transfer Class A common shares until their Class A holdings fall below 10%.  Unless and until this situation is satisfied in a manner permitted by the Company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the subject shareholders will not be permitted to vote their shares of common stock.To the extent that the voting rights of particular holders of Class A common stock are suspended as of times when the Company's shareholders vote due to the above-mentioned provisions, such suspension will have the effect of increasing the voting power of those holders of Class A common shares whose voting rights are not suspended.  As of February 28, 2014, Daniel Bernstein, the Company's chief executive officer, beneficially owned 353,204 Class A common shares (or 30.1%) of the outstanding Class A common shares whose voting rights were not suspended, the Estate of Elliot Bernstein beneficially owned 82,357 Class A common shares (or 7.0%) of the outstanding Class A common shares whose voting rights were not suspended and all directors and executive officers as a group (which includes Daniel Bernstein, but does not include the Estate of Elliot Bernstein) beneficially owned 501,095 Class A common shares (or 42.6%) of the outstanding Class A common shares whose voting rights were not suspended.We are dependent on information technology and our systems and infrastructure face certain risks, including cyber security risks and data leakage risks. We are dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure. Any significant breakdown, invasion, destruction or interruption of these systems by employees, others with authorized access to our systems, or unauthorized persons could negatively affect operations. There is also a risk that we could experience a business interruption, theft of information or reputational damage as a result of a cyber attack, such as an infiltration of a data center, or data leakage of confidential information either internally or at our third-party providers. While we have invested in the protection of our data and information technology to reduce these risks and periodically test the security of our information systems network, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent breakdowns or breaches in our systems that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity"
1,BELFB,BEL FUSE INC,2013-03-12,"  Risk Factors
An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk.  Investors should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all other information contained in this Annual Report before making investment decisions with respect to our common stock.  Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business in the future.We do business in a highly competitive industry.Our business is largely in a highly competitive worldwide industry, with relatively low barriers to competitive entry. We compete principally on the basis of product performance, quality, reliability, depth of product line, customer service, technological innovation, design, delivery time and price. The industry in which we operate has become increasingly concentrated and globalized in recent years and our major competitors, some of which are larger than Bel, have significant financial resources and technological capabilities.Our backlog figures may not be reliable indicators.Many of the orders that comprise our backlog may be delayed, accelerated or canceled by customers without penalty. Customers may on occasion double order from multiple sources to ensure timely delivery when leadtimes are particularly long. Customers often cancel orders when business is weak and inventories are excessive.  Therefore, we cannot be certain that the amount of our backlog equals or exceeds the level of orders that will ultimately be delivered. Our results of operations could be adversely impacted if customers cancel a material portion of orders in our backlog.There are several factors which can cause us to lower our prices.a)       The average selling prices for our products tend to decrease rapidly over their life cycle, and customers are increasingly putting pressure on suppliers to lower prices even when production costs are increasing. Our profits suffer if we are not able to reduce our costs of production, induce technological innovations as sales prices decline, or pass through cost increases to customers.b)       Any drop in demand or increase in supply of our products could cause a dramatic drop in our average sales prices which in turn could result in a decrease in our gross margins.  A shift in product mix could also have a favorable or unfavorable impact on our gross margins, depending upon the underlying raw material content and labor requirements of the associated products.c)       Increased competition from low cost suppliers around the world has put further pressures on pricing.  We continually strive to lower our costs, negotiate better pricing for components and raw materials and improve our operating efficiencies.  Profit margins will be materially and adversely impacted if we are not able to reduce our costs of production or introduce technological innovations when sales prices decline.In China, we are challenged to match availability of workers and maintain leadtimes in line with customer demand for certain of our products, which has been highly volatile in recent years.  This volatility can materially adversely affect Bel’s results.In the PRC, the availability of labor is cyclical and is significantly affected by the migration of workers in relation to the annual Lunar New Year holiday as well as economic conditions in the PRC.  In addition, we have little visibility into the ordering habits of our customers and can be subjected to large and unpredictable variations in demand for our products.  Accordingly, we must continually recruit and train new workers to replace those lost to attrition each year and to address peaks in demand that may occur from time to time.  These recruiting and training efforts and related inefficiencies, as well as overtime required in order to meet demand, can add volatility to the costs incurred by the Company for labor in the PRC. In 2011, we experienced a softening in customer demand for certain of our products, which resulted in underutilized capacity and lower gross margins, as our fixed costs had a lower absorption rate.  After the 2012 Lunar New Year holiday, there was an increase in customer demand which resulted in the hiring and training of new workers and related inefficiencies.  -7-Return to IndexWe are dependent on our ability to develop new products.Our future operating results are dependent, in part, on our ability to develop, produce and market new and more technologically advanced products. There are numerous risks inherent in this process, including the risks that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to timely develop and bring to market new products and applications to meet customers’ changing needs.Our acquisitions may not produce the anticipated results.A significant portion of our growth is from acquisitions. We cannot assure you that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future. If an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our other businesses, our results of operations, enterprise value, market value and prospects could all be materially and adversely affected.  Integration of new acquisitions into our consolidated operations may result in lower average operating results for the group as a whole, and may divert management’s focus from the ongoing operations of the Company during the integration period.Our strategy also focuses on the reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses through the integration or elimination of redundant sales facilities and administrative functions at acquired companies. During 2012, the Company completed three acquisitions (the “2012 Acquisitions”), as previously described in the Acquisitions section of this Form 10-K.  If we are unable to achieve our expectations with respect to the 2012 Acquisitions or future acquisitions, such inability could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations.  In connection with the 2012 Acquisitions, we have preliminarily recorded $9.7 million of goodwill and $10.4 million of other intangible assets.  If our acquisitions fail to perform up to our expectations, or if the value of goodwill or other intangible assets decreases as a result of weakened economic conditions, we could be required to record a loss from the impairment of these assets.If we were to undertake a substantial acquisition for cash, the acquisition would either be funded with cash on hand or financed in part through bank borrowings or the issuance of public or private debt or equity. The acquisition of the 2012 Acquired Companies was funded with cash on hand and shares of the Company’s Class B common stock.  We expect to fund our pending acquisition of the Transpower magnetics business of TE for approximately $22.4 million in cash from existing cash resources.  If we borrow money to finance future acquisitions, this would likely decrease our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage criteria and could result in the imposition of material restrictive covenants.  Under our existing credit facility, we are required to obtain our lenders’ consent for certain additional debt financing and to comply with other covenants, including the application of specific financial ratios, and we may be restricted from paying cash dividends on our capital stock. We cannot assure you that the necessary acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, when required. If we issue a substantial amount of stock either as consideration in an acquisition or to finance an acquisition, such issuance may dilute existing stockholders and may take the form of capital stock having preferences over our existing common stock.We are exposed to weaknesses in international markets and other risks inherent in foreign trade.We have operations in nine countries around the world outside the United States, and approximately 64% of our revenues during 2012 were derived from sales to customers outside the United States. Some of the countries in which we operate have in the past experienced and may continue to experience political, economic, and military instability or unrest, medical epidemic and natural disasters.  These conditions could have a material and adverse impact on our ability to operate in these regions and, depending on the extent and severity of these conditions, could materially and adversely affect our overall financial condition and operating results.Although our operations have traditionally been largely transacted in U.S. dollars or U.S. dollar linked currencies, recent world financial instability may cause additional foreign currency risks in the countries in which we operate.  The decoupling of the Chinese Renminbi from the U.S. dollar has increased, and will continue to increase financial risk.  With the acquisition of Cinch, the Company has additional exposure to foreign currency risks associated with the British Pound and Mexican Peso as the Company now has a larger labor force in Great Britain and Mexico.  The 2012 Acquisitions increased our exposure in Great Britain, the Eurozone and Sweden.Other risks inherent in doing business internationally include: expropriation and nationalization, trade restrictions, transportation delays, and changes in United States laws that may inhibit or restrict our ability to manufacture in or sell to any particular country.  For information regarding risks associated with our presence in Asia, see ""Item 2 - Properties"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.While we have benefited from favorable tax treatment in many of the countries where we operate, this situation could change if laws or rules in the United States or those foreign jurisdictions change, incentives are changed or revoked, or we are unable to renew current incentives.  -8-Return to IndexThe loss of certain substantial customers could materially and adversely affect us.During the year ended December 31, 2012, sales to two customers each exceeded 10% of our consolidated revenue. One such customer  (Hon Hai Precision Industry Company Ltd.) represented 14.4% of our revenue and the other (Flextronics International Ltd.) represented 10.2% of our revenue. We believe that the loss of either of these customers would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  We have experienced significant concentrations in prior years. See Note 12 of the notes to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.We may experience labor unrest.As we implement transfers of certain of our operations, we may experience strikes or other types of labor unrest as a result of lay-offs or termination of employees in higher labor cost countries.  Our manufacturing facilities in New York, the United Kingdom and Mexico are represented by labor unions and all factory workers in the PRC are represented by government-sponsored unions.We may experience labor shortages.Government economic, social and labor policies in the PRC may cause shortages of factory labor in areas where we have our products manufactured.  If we are required to manufacture more products outside of the PRC as a result of such shortages, our margins will likely be materially adversely affected.Our results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted by environmental and other regulations.Our manufacturing operations, products and/or product packaging are subject to environmental laws and regulations governing air emissions; wastewater discharges; the handling, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances, wastes and certain chemicals used or generated in our manufacturing processes; employee health and safety labeling or other notifications with respect to the content or other aspects of our processes, products or packaging; restrictions on the use of certain materials in or on design aspects of our products or product packaging; and, responsibility for disposal of products or product packaging. More stringent environmental regulations may be enacted in the future, and we cannot presently determine the modifications, if any, in our operations that any such future regulations might require, or the cost of compliance with these regulations.We may face risks relating to climate change that could have an adverse impact on our business.Greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions have increasingly become the subject of substantial international, national, regional, state and local attention.  GHG emission regulations have been promulgated in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate, and additional GHG requirements are in various stages of development.  Such measures could require us to modify existing or obtain new permits, implement additional pollution control technology, curtail operations or increase our operating costs.  Any additional regulation of GHG emissions, including a cap-and-trade system, technology mandate, emissions tax, reporting requirement or other program, could adversely affect our business. Customer requirements and new regulations may increase our expenses and impact the availability of certain raw materials, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating profits.The products we manufacture utilize materials that are impacted by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) requirement for disclosure of the use of “conflict minerals” mined in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries.  We have begun the process of determining the country of origin of certain metals that we purchase from our suppliers, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. Under regulations promulgated pursuant to that Act, we will be required to submit a report regarding our usage of conflict minerals in 2014.  The supply chain due diligence and verification of sources may require several years to complete based on the current availability of smelter origin information and the number of vendors.  We have begun to obtain and review the information from our suppliers. We may not be able to complete the process in the timeframe required because of the complexity of our supply chain.Other governmental social responsibility regulations also may impact our suppliers, manufacturing operations and operating profits.The need to find alternative sources for certain raw materials or products because of customer requirements and regulations may impact our ability to secure adequate supplies of raw materials, lead to supply shortages, or adversely impact the prices at which we can procure compliant goods.       -9-Return to IndexOur results may vary substantially from period to period.Our revenues and expenses may vary significantly from one accounting period to another accounting period due to a variety of factors, including customers' buying decisions, our product mix, the volatility of raw material costs and general market and economic conditions.  Such variations could significantly impact our stock price.A shortage of availability or an increase in the cost of raw materials and components may adversely impact our ability to procure high quality raw materials at cost effective prices and thus may negatively impact profit margins.Our results of operations may be adversely impacted by difficulties in obtaining raw materials, supplies, power, labor, natural resources and any other items needed for the production of our products, as well as by the effects of quality deviations in raw materials and the effects of significant fluctuations in the prices of existing inventories and purchase commitments for these materials.  Many of these materials and components are produced by a limited number of suppliers and may be constrained by supplier capacity.As product life cycles shorten and during periods of market slowdowns, the risk of materials obsolescence increases and this may materially and adversely impact our financial results.Rapid shifts in demand for various products may cause some of our inventory of raw materials, components or finished goods to become obsolete.The life cycles and demand for our products are directly linked to the life cycles and demand for the end products into which they are designed.  Rapid shifts in the life cycles or demand for these end products due to technological shifts, economic conditions or other market trends may result in material amounts of inventory of either raw materials or finished goods becoming obsolete.   While the Company works diligently to manage inventory levels, rapid shifts in demand may result in obsolete or excess inventory and materially impact financial results.A loss of the services of the Company’s executive officers or other skilled associates could negatively impact our operations and results.The success of the Company’s operations is largely dependent upon the performance of its executive officers, managers, engineers and sales people.  Many of these individuals have a significant number of years of experience within the Company and/or the industry in which we compete and would be extremely difficult to replace.  The loss of the services of any of these associates may materially and adversely impact our results of operations if we are unable to replace them in a timely manner.Our stock price, like that of many technology companies, has been and may continue to be volatile.The market price of our common stock may fluctuate as a result of variations in our quarterly operating results and other factors beyond our control.  These fluctuations may be exaggerated if the trading volume of our common stock is low.  The market price of our common stock may rise and fall in response to a variety of other factors, including:·  announcements of technological or competitive developments;·  general market or economic conditions;·  market or economic conditions specific to particular geographical areas in which we operate;·  acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or our competitors;·  the gain or loss of a significant customer or order; or·  changes in estimates of our financial performance or changes in recommendations by securities analysts regarding us or our industryIn addition, equity securities of many technology companies have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations even in periods when the capital markets generally are not distressed.  These price and volume fluctuations often have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies.Our intellectual property rights may not be adequately protected under the current state of the law.We cannot assure you we will be successful in protecting our intellectual property through patent or other laws.  As a result, other companies may be able to develop and market similar products which could materially and adversely affect our business.  -10-Return to IndexWe may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights and we may incur defense costs and possibly royalty obligations or lose the right to use technology important to our business.From time to time, we receive claims by third parties asserting that our products violate their intellectual property rights.  Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be time consuming and expensive to litigate or settle and could divert management attention from administering our business.  A third party asserting infringement claims against us or our customers with respect to our current or future products may materially and adversely affect us by, for example, causing us to enter into costly royalty arrangements or forcing us to incur settlement or litigation costs.   In connection with patent infringement lawsuits discussed in Item 3. Legal Proceedings, the Company incurred expenses of $3.5 million and $8.1 million related to lawsuit settlements in 2011 and 2010, respectively.Our investments in marketable securities could have a negative impact on our profitability.As part of our acquisition strategies, we may from time to time acquire equity positions in companies that could be attractive acquisition candidates or could otherwise be potential co-venturers in potential business transactions with us.  Market declines occurring subsequent to any such investment could have a negative impact on our profitability.   During 2012, the Company recorded $0.9 million in impairment charges and a realized loss on sale of its investment in Pulse Electronics common stock.As a result of protective provisions in the Company’s certificate of incorporation, the voting power of certain officers, directors and principal shareholders may be increased at future meetings of the Company’s shareholders.The Company's certificate of incorporation provides that if a shareholder, other than shareholders subject to specific exceptions, acquires (after the date of the Company’s 1998 recapitalization) 10% or more of the outstanding Class A common stock and does not own an equal or greater percentage of all then outstanding shares of both Class A and Class B common stock (all of which common stock must have been acquired after the date of the 1998 recapitalization), such shareholder must, within 90 days of the trigger date, purchase Class B common shares, in an amount and at a price determined in accordance with a formula described in the Company's certificate of incorporation, or forfeit its right to vote its Class A common shares. As of February 28, 2013, to the Company’s knowledge, there were two shareholders of the Company's common stock with ownership in excess of 10% of Class A outstanding shares with no ownership of the Company's Class B common stock and with no basis for exception from the operation of the above-mentioned provisions. In order to vote their respective shares at Bel's next shareholders' meeting, these shareholders must either purchase the required number of Class B common shares or sell or otherwise transfer Class A common shares until their Class A holdings are under 10%. As of February 28, 2013, to the Company's knowledge, these shareholders owned 31.6% and 13.3%, respectively, of the Company's Class A common stock and had not taken steps to either purchase the required number of Class B common shares or sell or otherwise transfer Class A common shares until their Class A holdings fall below 10%.  Unless and until this situation is satisfied in a manner permitted by the Company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the subject shareholders will not be permitted to vote their shares of Common Stock.To the extent that the voting rights of particular holders of Class A common stock are suspended as of times when the Company's shareholders vote due to the above-mentioned provisions, such suspension will have the effect of increasing the voting power of those holders of Class A common shares whose voting rights are not suspended.  As of February 28, 2013, Daniel Bernstein, the Company's chief executive officer, beneficially owned 353,204 Class A common shares (or 29.4%) of the outstanding Class A common shares whose voting rights were not suspended, the Estate of Elliot Bernstein beneficially owned 82,357 Class A common shares (or 6.9%) of the outstanding Class A common shares whose voting rights were not suspended and all directors and executive officers as a group (which includes Daniel Bernstein, but does not include the Estate of Elliot Bernstein) beneficially owned 501,092 Class A common shares (or 41.6%) of the outstanding Class A common shares whose voting rights were not suspended"

One such customer, located in Asia, represented 11.4% of our revenue and the other, located in North America, represented 10.9% of our revenue. We believe that the loss of either of these customers would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  We have experienced significant concentrations in prior years. See Note 11 of the notes to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.We may experience labor unrest.As we implement transfers of certain of our operations, we may experience strikes or other types of labor unrest as a result of lay-offs or termination of employees in higher labor cost countries.  Our manufacturing facilities in New York, the United Kingdom and Mexico are represented by labor unions and all factory workers in the PRC are represented by government-sponsored unions.We may experience labor shortages.Government economic, social and labor policies in the PRC may cause shortages of factory labor in areas where we have our products manufactured.  If we are required to manufacture more products outside of the PRC as a result of such shortages, our margins will likely be materially adversely affected.Our results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted by environmental and other regulations.Our manufacturing operations, products and/or product packaging are subject to environmental laws and regulations governing air emissions; wastewater discharges; the handling, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances, wastes and certain chemicals used or generated in our manufacturing processes; employee health and safety labeling or other notifications with respect to the content or other aspects of our processes, products or packaging; restrictions on the use of certain materials in or on design aspects of our products or product packaging; and, responsibility for disposal of products or product packaging. More stringent environmental regulations may be enacted in the future, and we cannot presently determine the modifications, if any, in our operations that any such future regulations might require, or the cost of compliance with these regulations.We may face risks relating to climate change that could have an adverse impact on our business.Greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions have increasingly become the subject of substantial international, national, regional, state and local attention.  GHG emission regulations have been promulgated in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate, and additional GHG requirements are in various stages of development.  Such measures could require us to modify existing or obtain new permits, implement additional pollution control technology, curtail operations or increase our operating costs.  Any additional regulation of GHG emissions, including a cap-and-trade system, technology mandate, emissions tax, reporting requirement or other program, could adversely affect our business. Customer requirements and new regulations may increase our expenses and impact the availability of certain raw materials, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating profits.The products we manufacture utilize materials that are impacted by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) requirement for disclosure of the use of “conflict minerals” mined in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries.    -8-Return to Index We have begun the process of determining the country of origin of certain metals that we purchase from our suppliers, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The supply chain due diligence and verification of sources may require several years to complete based on the current availability of smelter origin information and the number of vendors.  We have begun to obtain and review the information from our suppliers. We may not be able to complete the process in the timeframe required because of the complexity of our supply chain.Other governmental social responsibility regulations also may impact our suppliers, manufacturing operations and operating profits.The need to find alternative sources for certain raw materials or products because of customer requirements and regulations may impact our ability to secure adequate supplies of raw materials, lead to supply shortages, or adversely impact the prices at which we can procure compliant goods.     Our results may vary substantially from period to period.Our revenues and expenses may vary significantly from one accounting period to another accounting period due to a variety of factors, including customers' buying decisions, our product mix, the volatility of raw material costs and general market and economic conditions.  Such variations could significantly impact our stock price.A shortage of availability or an increase in the cost of raw materials and components may adversely impact our ability to procure high quality raw materials at cost effective prices and thus may negatively impact profit margins.Our results of operations may be adversely impacted by difficulties in obtaining raw materials, supplies, power, labor, natural resources and any other items needed for the production of our products, as well as by the effects of quality deviations in raw materials and the effects of significant fluctuations in the prices of existing inventories and purchase commitments for these materials.  Many of these materials and components are produced by a limited number of suppliers and may be constrained by supplier capacity.As product life cycles shorten and during periods of market slowdowns, the risk of materials obsolescence increases and this may materially and adversely impact our financial results.Rapid shifts in demand for various products may cause some of our inventory of raw materials, components or finished goods to become obsolete.The life cycles and demand for our products are directly linked to the life cycles and demand for the end products into which they are designed.  Rapid shifts in the life cycles or demand for these end products due to technological shifts, economic conditions or other market trends may result in material amounts of inventory of either raw materials or finished goods becoming obsolete.   While the Company works diligently to manage inventory levels, rapid shifts in demand may result in obsolete or excess inventory and materially impact financial results.A loss of the services of the Company’s executive officers or other skilled associates could negatively impact our operations and results.The success of the Company’s operations is largely dependent upon the performance of its executive officers, managers, engineers and sales people.  Many of these individuals have a significant number of years of experience within the Company and/or the industry in which we compete and would be extremely difficult to replace.  The loss of the services of any of these associates may materially and adversely impact our results of operations if we are unable to replace them in a timely manner.Our stock price, like that of many technology companies, has been and may continue to be volatile.The market price of our common stock may fluctuate as a result of variations in our quarterly operating results and other factors beyond our control.  These fluctuations may be exaggerated if the trading volume of our common stock is low.  The market price of our common stock may rise and fall in response to a variety of other factors, including:·  announcements of technological or competitive developments;·  general market or economic conditions;·  market or economic conditions specific to particular geographical areas in which we operate;·  acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or our competitors;·  the gain or loss of a significant customer or order; or·  changes in estimates of our financial performance or changes in recommendations by securities analysts regarding us or our industry  -9-Return to Index In addition, equity securities of many technology companies have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations even in periods when the capital markets generally are not distressed.  These price and volume fluctuations often have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies.Our intellectual property rights may not be adequately protected under the current state of the law.We cannot assure you we will be successful in protecting our intellectual property through patent or other laws.  As a result, other companies may be able to develop and market similar products which could materially and adversely affect our business.We may be sued by third parties for alleged infringement of their proprietary rights and we may incur defense costs and possibly royalty obligations or lose the right to use technology important to our business.From time to time, we receive claims by third parties asserting that our products violate their intellectual property rights.  Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be time consuming and expensive to litigate or settle and could divert management attention from administering our business.  A third party asserting infringement claims against us or our customers with respect to our current or future products may materially and adversely affect us by, for example, causing us to enter into costly royalty arrangements or forcing us to incur settlement or litigation costs.   In connection with patent infringement lawsuits discussed in Item 3. Legal Proceedings, the Company incurred expenses of $3.5 million and $8.1 million related to lawsuit settlements in 2011 and 2010, respectively.  In 2009,  the Company paid a lump sum licensing fee of $2.1 million in exchange for a licensing agreement covering past and future sales of the Company’s MagJack® integrated connector modules (ICMs).Our investments in marketable securities could have a negative impact on our profitability.As part of our acquisition strategies, we may from time to time acquire equity positions in companies that could be attractive acquisition candidates or could otherwise be potential co-venturers in potential business transactions with us.  Market declines occurring subsequent to any such investment could have a negative impact on our profitability.As a result of protective provisions in the Company’s certificate of incorporation, the voting power of certain officers, directors and principal shareholders may be increased at future meetings of the Company’s shareholders.The Company's certificate of incorporation provides that if a shareholder, other than shareholders subject to specific exceptions, acquires (after the date of the Company’s 1998 recapitalization) 10% or more of the outstanding Class A common stock and does not own an equal or greater percentage of all then outstanding shares of both Class A and Class B common stock (all of which common stock must have been acquired after the date of the 1998 recapitalization), such shareholder must, within 90 days of the trigger date, purchase Class B common shares, in an amount and at a price determined in accordance with a formula described in the Company's certificate of incorporation, or forfeit its right to vote its Class A common shares. As of February 29, 2012, to the Company’s knowledge, there were two shareholders of the Company's common stock with ownership in excess of 10% of Class A outstanding shares with no ownership of the Company's Class B common stock and with no basis for exception from the operation of the above-mentioned provisions. In order to vote their respective shares at Bel's next shareholders' meeting, these shareholders must either purchase the required number of Class B common shares or sell or otherwise transfer Class A common shares until their Class A holdings are under 10%. As of February 29, 2012, to the Company's knowledge, these shareholders owned 31.6% and 14.5%, respectively, of the Company's Class A common stock and had not taken steps to either purchase the required number of Class B common shares or sell or otherwise transfer Class A common shares until their Class A holdings fall below 10%.  Unless and until this situation is satisfied in a manner permitted by the Company’s Restated Certificate of Incorporation, the subject shareholders will not be permitted to vote their shares of Common Stock.To the extent that the voting rights of particular holders of Class A common stock are suspended as of times when the Company's shareholders vote due to the above-mentioned provisions, such suspension will have the effect of increasing the voting power of those holders of Class A common shares whose voting rights are not suspended.  As of February 29, 2012, Daniel Bernstein, the Company's chief executive officer, beneficially owned 161,902 Class A common shares (or 13.8%) of the outstanding Class A common shares whose voting rights were not suspended, the Estate of Elliot Bernstein beneficially owned 251,132 Class A common shares (or 21.4%) of the outstanding Class A common shares whose voting rights were not suspended and all directors and executive officers as a group (which includes Daniel Bernstein, but does not include the Estate of Elliot Bernstein) beneficially owned 309,790 Class A common shares (or 26.3%) of the outstanding Class A common shares whose voting rights were not suspended"
4,BELFB,BEL FUSE INC,2011-03-11,"  Risk Factors
An investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk.  Investors should carefully consider the risks described below, together with all other information contained in this Annual Report before making investment decisions with respect to our common stock.  Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business in the future.We do business in a highly competitive industryOur business is largely in a highly competitive worldwide industry, with relatively low barriers to competitive entry. We compete principally on the basis of product performance, quality, reliability, depth of product line, customer service, technological innovation, design, delivery time and price. The electronic components industry has become increasingly concentrated and globalized in recent years and our major competitors, some of which are larger than Bel, have significant financial resources and technological capabilities.Our backlog figures may not be reliable indicators.Many of the orders that comprise our backlog may be delayed, accelerated or canceled by customers without penalty. Customers may on occasion double order from multiple sources to ensure timely delivery when leadtimes are particularly long. Customers often cancel orders when business is weak and inventories are excessive.  Therefore, we cannot be certain that the amount of our backlog equals or exceeds the level of orders that will ultimately be delivered. Our results of operations could be adversely impacted if customers cancel a material portion of orders in our backlog.  -6-Return to IndexThere are several factors which can cause us to lower our prices.a)       The average selling prices for our products tend to decrease rapidly over their life cycle, and customers are increasingly putting pressure on suppliers to lower prices even when production costs are increasing. Our profits suffer if we are not able to reduce our costs of production, induce technological innovations as sales prices decline, or pass through cost increases to customers.b)       Any drop in demand or increase in supply of our products could cause a dramatic drop in our average sales prices which in turn could result in a decrease in our gross margins.  In addition, a shift in product mix could have a favorable or unfavorable impact on our gross margins, depending upon the underlying raw material content and labor requirements of the associated products.c)       Increased competition from low cost suppliers around the world has put further pressures on pricing.    We continually strive to lower our costs, negotiate better pricing for components and raw materials and improve our operating efficiencies.  Profit margins will be materially and adversely impacted if we are not able to reduce our costs of production or introduce technological innovations when sales prices decline. In recent periods, demand for our products has been highly volatile, which materially adversely impacts Bel as we are challenged to bring workforce and leadtimes in line with customer demand.Following the 2009 reduction in customer demand, Bel entered 2010 with insufficient labor to meet customer requirements when customers significantly increased requirements.  The increased demand by customers also placed severe pressure on many suppliers of our raw materials, which often resulted in insufficient availability to Bel and its competitors.  By late 2010, labor and material availability had returned to normal levels.  Any future economic volatility would create a similar pattern, which ultimately can result in increased labor and material costs and lower gross profits.In China, it is difficult for us to match availability of workers with customer demand.In the PRC, the availability of labor is cyclical and is significantly affected by the migration of workers in relation to the annual Lunar New Year holiday as well as economic conditions in the PRC.  In addition, we have little visibility into the ordering habits of our customers and can be subjected to large and unpredictable variations in demand for our products.  Accordingly, we must continually recruit and train new workers to replace those lost to attrition each year and to address peaks in demand that may occur from time to time.  These recruiting and training efforts and related inefficiencies, and overtime required in order to meet demand can add volatility to the costs incurred by the Company for labor in the PRC.We are dependent on our ability to develop new products.Our future operating results are dependent, in part, on our ability to develop, produce and market new and more technologically advanced products. There are numerous risks inherent in this process, including the risks that we will be unable to anticipate the direction of technological change or that we will be unable to timely develop and bring to market new products and applications to meet customers’ changing needs.Our acquisitions may not produce the anticipated results.A significant portion of our growth is from acquisitions. We cannot assure you that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with suitable acquisition candidates in the future. If an acquired business fails to operate as anticipated or cannot be successfully integrated with our other businesses, our results of operations, enterprise value, market value and prospects could all be materially and adversely affected.  Integration of new acquisitions into our consolidated operations may result in lower average operating results for the group as a whole, and may divert management’s focus from the ongoing operations of the Company during the integration period.If our acquisitions fail to perform up to our expectations, or if the value of goodwill decreases as a result of weakened economic conditions, we could be required to record a loss from the impairment of assets.  The Company recorded charges of $12.9 million and $14.1 million related to the impairment of goodwill during the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively.  In addition, a total of $0.7 million of fixed asset impairments was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2008.Our strategy also focuses on the reduction of selling, general and administrative expenses through the integration or elimination of redundant sales facilities and administrative functions at acquired companies. On January 29, 2010, the Company acquired Cinch as previously described in the Acquisitions section of this Form 10-K.  Our inability to achieve our expectations with respect to the Cinch acquisition or future acquisitions could have a material and adverse effect on our results of operations.  -7-Return to IndexIf we were to undertake a substantial acquisition for cash, the acquisition would either be funded with cash on hand or financed in part through bank borrowings or the issuance of public or private debt or equity. The acquisition of Cinch was funded with cash on hand.  If we borrow money to finance future acquisitions, this would likely decrease our ratio of earnings to fixed charges and adversely affect other leverage criteria and could result in the imposition of material restrictive covenants.  Under our existing credit facility, we are required to obtain our lenders’ consent for certain additional debt financing and to comply with other covenants, including the application of specific financial ratios, and we may be restricted from paying cash dividends on our capital stock. We cannot assure you that the necessary acquisition financing would be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all, when required. If we issue a substantial amount of stock either as consideration in an acquisition or to finance an acquisition, such issuance may dilute existing stockholders and may take the form of capital stock having preferences over our existing common stock.We are exposed to weaknesses in international markets and other risks inherent in foreign trade.We have operations in six countries around the world outside the United States, and approximately 67% of our revenues during 2010 were derived from sales to customers outside the United States. Some of the countries in which we operate have in the past experienced and may continue to experience political, economic, and military instability or unrest, medical epidemic and natural disasters.  These conditions could have a material and adverse impact on our ability to operate in these regions and, depending on the extent and severity of these conditions, could materially and adversely affect our overall financial condition and operating results.Although our operations have traditionally been largely transacted in U.S. dollars or U.S. dollar linked currencies, recent world financial instability may cause additional foreign currency risks in the countries in which we operate.  The decoupling of the Chinese Renminbi from the U.S. dollar has increased, and will continue to increase financial risk.  In addition, with the acquisition of Cinch, the Company has additional exposure to foreign currency risks associated with the Mexican Peso as the Company now has a larger labor force in Mexico.Other risks inherent in doing business internationally include: expropriation and nationalization, trade restrictions, transportation delays, and changes in United States laws that may inhibit or restrict our ability to manufacture in or sell to any particular country.  For information regarding risks associated with our presence in Hong Kong, see ""Item 2 - Properties"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.While we have benefited from favorable tax treatment in many of the countries where we operate, the benefits we currently enjoy could change if laws or rules in the United States or those foreign jurisdictions change, incentives are changed or revoked, or we are unable to renew current incentives.The loss of certain substantial customers could materially and adversely affect us.During the year ended December 31, 2010, we had two customers with sales in excess of 10% of our consolidated revenue. One such customer represented 13.6% of our revenue and the other represented 11.1% of our revenue. We believe that the loss of either of these customers would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations, financial position and cash flows.  We have experienced significant concentrations in prior years. See Note 11 of the notes to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.We may experience labor unrest.As we implement transfers of certain of our operations, we may experience strikes or other types of labor unrest as a result of lay-offs or termination of employees in higher labor cost countries.  Our manufacturing facility in New York is represented by a labor union and all factory workers in the PRC are represented by government-sponsored unions.  In addition, in connection with the Cinch acquisition we acquired manufacturing facilities located in the United Kingdom and Mexico whose factory workers are represented by labor unions.We may experience labor shortages.Government economic, social and labor policies in the PRC may cause shortages of factory labor in areas where we have our products manufactured.  If we are required to manufacture more products outside of the PRC as a result of such shortages, our margins will likely be materially adversely affected.Our results of operations may be materially and adversely impacted by environmental and other regulations.Our manufacturing operations, products and/or product packaging are subject to environmental laws and regulations governing air emissions; wastewater discharges; the handling, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances, wastes and certain chemicals used or generated in our manufacturing processes; employee health and safety labeling or other notifications with respect to the content or other aspects of our processes, products or packaging; restrictions on the use of certain materials in or on design aspects of our products or product packaging; and, responsibility for disposal of products or product packaging. More stringent environmental regulations may be enacted in the future, and we cannot presently determine the modifications, if any, in our operations that any such future regulations might require, or the cost of compliance with these regulations.  -8-Return to IndexWe may face risks relating to climate change that could have an adverse impact on our business.Greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions have increasingly become the subject of substantial international, national, regional, state and local attention.  GHG emission regulations have been promulgated in certain of the jurisdictions in which we operate, and additional GHG requirements are in various stages of development.  Such measures could require us to modify existing or obtain new permits, implement additional pollution control technology, curtail operations or increase our operating costs.  Any additional regulation of GHG emissions, including a cap-and-trade system, technology mandate, emissions tax, reporting requirement or other program, could adversely affect our business.Our results may vary substantially from period to period.Our revenues and expenses may vary significantly from one accounting period to another accounting period due to a variety of factors, including customers' buying decisions, our product mix, the volatility of raw material costs and general market and economic conditions.  Such variations could significantly impact our stock price.A shortage of availability or an increase in the cost of raw materials and components may adversely impact our ability to procure high quality raw materials at cost effective prices and thus may negatively impact profit margins.Our results of operations may be adversely impacted by difficulties in obtaining raw materials, supplies, power, labor, natural resources and any other items needed for the production of our products, as well as by the effects of quality deviations in raw materials and the effects of significant fluctuations in the prices of existing inventories and purchase commitments for these materials.  Many of these materials and components are produced by a limited number of suppliers and may be constrained by supplier capacity.As product life cycles shorten and during periods of market slowdowns, the risk of materials obsolescence increases and this may materially and adversely impact our financial results.Rapid shifts in demand for various products may cause some of our inventory of raw materials, components or finished goods to become obsolete.The life cycles and demand for our products are directly linked to the life cycles and demand for the end products into which they are designed.  Rapid shifts in the life cycles or demand for these end products due to technological shifts, economic conditions or other market trends may result in material amounts of inventory of either raw materials or finished goods becoming obsolete.   While the Company works diligently to manage inventory levels, rapid shifts in demand may result in obsolete or excess inventory and materially impact financial results.A loss of the services of the Company’s executive officers or other skilled associates could negatively impact our operations and results.The success of the Company’s operations is largely dependent upon the performance of its executive officers, managers, engineers and sales people.  Many of these individuals have a significant number of years of experience within the Company and/or the industry in which we compete and would be extremely difficult to replace.  The loss of the services of any of these associates may materially and adversely impact our results of operations if we are unable to replace them in a timely manner.Our stock price, like that of many technology companies, has been and may continue to be volatile.The market price of our common stock may fluctuate as a result of variations in our quarterly operating results and other factors beyond our control.  These fluctuations may be exaggerated if the trading volume of our common stock is low.  In addition, the market price of our common stock may rise and fall in response to a variety of factors, including:·  announcements of technological or competitive developments;·  general market or economic conditions;·  acquisitions or strategic alliances by us or our competitors;·  the gain or loss of a significant customer or order;
