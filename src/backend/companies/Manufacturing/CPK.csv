.The following is a discussion of the primary financial, operational, regulatory and legal, andenvironmental risk factors that may affect the operations and/or financial performance of ourregulated and unregulated businesses. Refer to the section entitled Managements Discussion andAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Item 7 of this report for anadditional discussion of these and other related factors that affect our operations and/orfinancial performance.Financial RisksThe anticipated benefits of the merger with FPU may not be realized.We entered into the merger with FPU with the expectation that the merger would result in variousbenefits, including, among other things, synergies, cost savings and operating efficiencies.Although we have achieved significant synergies, cost savings and operating efficiencies since themerger, there can be no assurance that these benefits will be sustained in the future, oradditional benefits will be achieved in the future. Failure to sustain these benefits or achieveadditional benefits in the future will adversely affect our expected future performance.We are currently in discussionswith the Office of Public Counsel of Florida and the Florida PSC staff regarding the benefitsand cost savings of the merger, current and expected earnings level as well as the recovery ofapproximately $34.9 million in purchase premium and $2.2 million in merger-related costs. If wefail to obtain the necessary approval to earn a return on the purchase premium and merger-relatedcosts and treat the amortization as allowable operating costs, we may be required to expense theamortization of these assets without recovery which will adverselyaffect our financial performance for the related periods.  We may also be required to pass on to ratepayers,some, or all of the increased earnings generated from cost savings, resulting from the merger.Instability and volatility in the financial markets could have a negative impact on our growthstrategy.Our business strategy includes the continued pursuit of growth, both organically and throughacquisitions. To the extent that we do not generate sufficient cash from operations, we may incuradditional indebtedness to finance our growth. Specifically, we rely on access to both short-termand long-term capital markets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements notsatisfied by the cash flows from our operations. Currently, $40 million of the total $100 millionof short-term lines of credit utilized to satisfy our short-term financing requirements arediscretionary, uncommitted lines of credit. We utilize discretionary lines of credit to reduce thecost associated with these short-term financing requirements. We are committed to maintaining asound capital structure and strong credit ratings to provide the financial flexibility needed toaccess the capital markets when required. However, if we are not able to access capital atcompetitive rates, our ability to implement our strategic plan, undertake improvements and makeother investments required for our future growth may be limited.A downgrade in our credit rating could adversely affect our access to capital markets and our costof capital.Our ability to obtain adequate and cost-effective capital depends on our credit ratings, which aregreatly affected by our financial performance and the liquidity of financial markets. A downgradein our current credit ratings could adversely affect our access to capital markets, as well as ourcost of capital.Debt covenant obligations, if triggered, may affect our financial condition.Our long-term debt obligations and committed short-term lines of credit contain financial covenantsrelated to debt-to-capital ratios and interest-coverage ratios. Failure to comply with any ofthese covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result inthe acceleration of outstanding debt obligations or the inability to borrow under certain creditagreements. Any such acceleration would cause a material adverse change in our financialcondition. Chesapeake Utilities Corporation 2010 Form 10-K     Page 13Table of ContentsThe continuation of recent economic conditions could adversely affect our customers andnegatively impact our financial results.A continued downturn in the economies of the regions in which we operate, together withincreased unemployment, mortgage and other credit defaults and significant decreases in the valuesof homes and investment assets, have adversely affected the financial resources of many domestichouseholds. These economic conditions have slowed the growth in our customer base and cash flows.It is unclear whether governmental responses to these conditions will be successful in lesseningthe severity or duration of the current recession. As a result, our customers may use less naturalgas, electricity or propane and it may become more difficult for them to pay their bills. This mayslow collections and lead to higher than normal levels of accounts receivable, which in turn, couldincrease our financing requirements and result in higher bad debt expense.An increase in interest rates may adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.An increase in interest rates, without the recovery of the higher cost of debt in the sales and/ortransportation rates we charge our utility customers, could adversely affect future earnings. Anincrease in short-term interest rates would negatively affect our results of operations, whichdepend on short-term lines of credit to finance accounts receivable and storage gas inventories, aswell as to temporarily finance capital expenditures.Inflation may impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.Inflation affects the cost of supply, labor, products and services required for operations,maintenance and capital improvements. To help cope with the effects of inflation on our capitalinvestments and returns, we seek rate increases from regulatory commissions for regulatedoperations and closely monitor the returns of our unregulated operations. There can be noassurance that we will be able to obtain adequate and timely rate increases to offset the effectsof inflation. To compensate for fluctuations in propane gas prices, we adjust our propane sellingprices to the extent allowed by the market. There can be no assurance, however, that we will beable to increase propane sales prices sufficiently to compensate fully for such fluctuations in thecost of propane gas to us.Our operations are exposed to market risks, beyond our control, which could adversely affect ourfinancial results and capital requirements.Our natural gas marketing and propane wholesale marketing operations are subject to marketrisks beyond their control, including market liquidity and commodity price volatility. Although wemaintain a risk management policy, we may not be able to offset completely the price riskassociated with volatile commodity prices, which could lead to volatility in earnings. Physicaltrading also has price risk on any net open positions at the end of each trading day, as well asvolatility resulting from: (i) intra-day fluctuations of natural gas and/or propane prices, and(ii) daily price movements between the time natural gas and/or propane is purchased or sold forfuture delivery and the time the related purchase or sale is hedged. The determination of our netopen position at the end of any trading day requires Xeron to make assumptions as to futurecircumstances, including the use of natural gas and/or propane by its customers in relation to itsanticipated market positions. Because the price risk associated with any net open position at theend of such day may increase if the assumptions are not realized, we review these assumptionsdaily. Net open positions may increase volatility in our financial condition or results ofoperations if market prices move in a significantly favorable or unfavorable manner, because thetiming of the recognition of profits or losses on the economic hedges for financial accountingpurposes usually does not match up with the timing of the economic profits or losses on the itembeing hedged. This volatility may occur, with a resulting increase or decrease in earnings orlosses, even though the expected profit margin is essentially unchanged from the date thetransactions were consummated.Our energy marketing subsidiaries have credit risk and credit requirements that may adverselyaffect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.Our energy marketing subsidiaries extend credit to counterparties and continually monitor andmanage collections aggressively. Each of these subsidiaries is exposed to the risk that it may notbe able to collect amounts owed to it. If the counterparty to such a transaction fails to perform,and any underlying collateral is inadequate, we could experience financial losses. Thesesubsidiaries are also dependent upon the availability of credit to buy propane and natural gas forresale or to trade. If financial market conditions decline generally, or the financial conditionof these subsidiaries or of our Company declines, then the cost of credit available to thesesubsidiaries could increase. If credit is not available, or if credit is more costly, our resultsof operations, cash flows and financial condition may be adversely affected. Chesapeake Utilities Corporation 2010 Form 10-K     Page 14Table of ContentsCurrent market conditions have had an adverse impact on the return on plan assets for ourpension plans, which may require significant additional funding and adversely affect our cashflows.We have pension plans that have been closed to new employees. The costs of providing benefits andrelated funding requirements of these plans are subject to changes in the market value of theassets that fund the plans. As a result of the extreme volatility and disruption in the domesticand international equity and bond markets in recent years, the asset values of Chesapeakes andFPUs pension plans have fluctuated significantly since 2008. The funded status of the plans andthe related costs reflected in our financial statements are affected by various factors that aresubject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, particularly in the current economic environment.Future losses of asset values may necessitate accelerated funding of the plans in the future tomeet minimum federal government requirements. Downward pressure on the asset values of our pensionplans may require us to fund obligations earlier than originally planned, which would have anadverse impact on our cash flows from operations, decrease borrowing capacity and increase interestexpense.Operational RisksWe may be unable to successfully integrate operations after the merger.The merger between Chesapeake and FPU involves the integration of two companies that havepreviously operated independently. We began the process of integrating operations, bothgeographically and organizationally, immediately after the merger and this process is stillon-going today. While significant progress has been made in integration, we continue to combineand enhance various systems, facilities and personnel deployment. Throughout the integrationprocess, we are subject to employee workforce factors, including loss of key employees,availability of qualified personnel, collective bargaining agreements with unions and workstoppages that could affect our business and financial condition. Continued integration effortsmay divert managements focus and resources from other strategic opportunities. The diversion ofmanagements attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connection with continuedintegration activities could result in the disruption of our ongoing businesses or inconsistenciesin standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintainrelationships with customers, suppliers, employees and others with whom we have business dealings.Fluctuations in weather may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financialcondition.Our natural gas and propane distribution operations are sensitive to fluctuations in weatherconditions, which directly influence the volume of natural gas and propane sold and delivered. Asignificant portion of our natural gas and propane distribution revenues is derived from the salesand deliveries of natural gas and propane to residential and commercial heating customers duringthe five-month peak heating season (November through March). If the weather is warmer than normal,we sell and deliver less natural gas and propane to customers, and earn less revenue. In addition,hurricanes or other extreme weather conditions could damage production or transportationfacilities, which could result in decreased supplies of natural gas, propane and electricity,increased supply costs and higher prices for customers.Our electric operations, while generally less seasonal than natural gas and propane sales aselectricity is used for both heating and cooling in our service areas, are also affected byvariations in general weather conditions and unusually severe weather.The amount and availability of natural gas, electricity and propane supplies are difficult topredict; a substantial reduction in available supplies could reduce our earnings in those segments.Natural gas, electricity and propane production can be affected by factors beyond our control, suchas weather, closings of generation facilities and refineries. If we are unable to obtain sufficientnatural gas, electricity and propane supplies to meet demand, results in those businesses may beadversely affected. Chesapeake Utilities Corporation 2010 Form 10-K     Page 15Table of ContentsWe rely on a limited number of natural gas, electric and propane suppliers, the loss of whichcould have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Our natural gas distribution and marketing operations, electric distribution operation and propaneoperations have entered into various agreements with suppliers to purchase natural gas, electricityand propane to serve their customers. The loss of any significant suppliers or our inability torenew these contracts at favorable terms upon their expiration could significantly affect ourability to serve our customers and have a material adverse impact on our financial condition andresults of operations.We rely on having access to interstate natural gas pipelines transmission and storage capacity andelectric transmission capacity; a substantial disruption or lack of growth in these services mayimpair our ability to meet customers existing and future requirements.In order to meet existing and future customer demands for natural gas and electricity, we mustacquire sufficient natural gas supplies, interstate pipeline transmission and storage capacity, andelectric transmission capacity to serve such requirements. We must contract for reliable andadequate delivery capacity for our distribution systems while considering the dynamics of theinterstate pipeline and storage and electric transmission markets, our own on-system resources, aswell as the characteristics of our markets. Our financial condition and results of operationswould be materially and adversely affected if the future availability of these capacities wereinsufficient to meet future customer demands for natural gas and electricity. Currently, FPUsnatural gas is transported primarily through one pipeline system. Any interruption to that systemcould adversely affect our ability to meet the demands of FPUs customers and our earnings.Commodity price changes may affect the operating costs and competitive positions of our naturalgas, electric and propane distribution operations, which may adversely affect our results ofoperations, cash flows and financial condition.Natural Gas/Electric. Higher natural gas prices can significantly increase the cost of gasbilled to our natural gas customers. Increases in the cost of coal and other fuels cansignificantly increase the cost of electricity billed to our electric customers. Such costincreases generally have no immediate effect on our revenues and net income because of ourregulated fuel cost recovery mechanisms. Our net income, however, may be reduced by higherexpenses that we may incur for uncollectible customer accounts and by lower volumes of natural gasand electricity deliveries when customers reduce their consumption. Therefore, increases in theprice of natural gas, coal and other fuels can affect our operating cash flows and thecompetitiveness of natural gas and electricity as energy sources and consequently have an adverseeffect on our operating cash flows.Propane. Propane costs are subject to volatile changes as a result of product supply orother market conditions, including weather and economic and political factors affecting crude oiland natural gas supply or pricing. Such cost changes can occur rapidly and can affectprofitability. There is no assurance that we will be able to pass on propane cost increases fullyor immediately, particularly when propane costs increase rapidly. Therefore, average retail salesprices can vary significantly from year to year as product costs fluctuate in response to propane,fuel oil, crude oil and natural gas commodity market conditions. In addition, in periods ofsustained higher commodity prices, declines in retail sales volumes due to reduced consumption andincreased amounts of uncollectible accounts may adversely affect net income.Our propane inventory is subject to inventory risk, which may adversely affect our results ofoperations and financial condition.Our propane distribution operations own bulk propane storage facilities, with an aggregate capacityof approximately 3.0 million gallons. We purchase and store propane based on several factors,including inventory levels and the price outlook. We may purchase large volumes of propane atcurrent market prices during periods of low demand and low prices, which generally occur during thesummer months. Propane is a commodity, and, as such, its unit price is subject to volatilefluctuations in response to changes in supply or other market conditions. We have no control overthese market conditions. Consequently, the unit price of the propane that we purchase can changerapidly over a short period of time. The market price for propane could fall below the price atwhich we made the purchases, which would adversely affect our profits or cause sales from thatinventory to be unprofitable. In addition, falling propane prices may result in inventorywrite-downs as required by U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) if the marketprice of propane falls below our weighted average cost of inventory, which could adversely affectnet income. Chesapeake Utilities Corporation 2010 Form 10-K     Page 16Table of ContentsOperating events affecting public safety and the reliability our natural gas and electricdistribution systems could adversely affect the results of operations, cash flows and financialcondition.Our business is exposed to operational events, such as major leaks, mechanical problems andaccidents, that could affect the public safety and reliability of our natural gas distribution andtransmission systems, significantly increase costs and cause loss of customer confidence. Theoccurrence of any such operational events could adversely affect the results of operations,financial condition and cash flows. If we are unable to recover from customers, through theregulatory process, all or some of these costs and our authorized rate of return on these costs,this also could adversely affect the results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Our electric operation is subject to various operational risks, including accidents, outages,equipment breakdowns or failures, or operations below expected levels of performance or efficiency.Problems such as the breakdown or failure of electric equipment or processes and interruptions inservice which would result in performance below expected levels of output or efficiency,particularly if extended for prolonged periods of time, could have a materially adverse effect onour financial condition and results of operations.Because we operate in a competitive environment, we may lose customers to competitors which couldadversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.Natural Gas. Our natural gas marketing operations compete with third-party suppliers tosell natural gas to commercial and industrial customers. Our natural gas transmission anddistribution operations compete with interstate pipelines when our transmission and/or distributioncustomers are located close enough to a competing pipeline to make direct connections economicallyfeasible. Failure to retain and grow our customer base in the natural gas operations would have anadverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.Electric. While there is active wholesale power sales competition in Florida, our retailelectric business through FPU has remained substantially free from direct competition. Changes inthe competitive environment caused by legislation, regulation, market conditions or initiatives ofother electric power providers, particularly with respect to retail competition, could adverselyaffect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.Propane. Our propane distribution operations compete with other propane distributors,primarily on the basis of service and price. Some of our competitors have significantly greaterresources. Our ability to grow the propane distribution business is contingent upon capturingadditional market share, expanding new service territories, and successfully utilizing pricingprograms that retain and grow our customer base. Failure to retain and grow our customer base inour propane gas operations would have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flowsand financial condition.Our propane wholesale marketing operations compete with various marketers, many of which havesignificantly greater resources and are able to obtain price or volumetric advantages.Changes in technology may adversely affect our advanced information services subsidiarys resultsof operations, cash flows and financial condition.BravePoint participates in a market that is characterized by rapidly changing technology andaccelerating product introduction cycles. The success of our advanced information servicessubsidiary depends upon our ability to address the rapidly changing needs of our customers bydeveloping and supplying high-quality, cost-effective products, product enhancements and services,on a timely basis, and by keeping pace with technological developments and emerging industrystandards. There is no assurance that we will be able to keep up with technological advancementsto the degree necessary to keep our products and services competitive. Chesapeake Utilities Corporation 2010 Form 10-K     Page 17Table of ContentsOur use of derivative instruments may adversely affect our results of operations.Fluctuating commodity prices may affect our earnings and financing costs because our propanedistribution and wholesale marketing operations use derivative instruments, including forwards,futures, swaps and puts, to hedge price risk. In addition, we have utilized in the past, and maydecide, after further evaluation, to continue to utilize derivative instruments to hedge pricerisk. While we have a risk management policy and operating procedures in place to control ourexposure to risk, if we purchase derivative instruments that are not properly matched to ourexposure, our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition may be adversely affected.Changes in customer growth may affect earnings and cash flows.Our ability to increase gross margins in our regulated energy and unregulated propane distributionbusinesses is dependent upon growth in the residential construction market, adding new commercialand industrial customers and conversion of customers to natural gas, electricity or propane fromother energy sources. Slowdowns in these markets may adversely affect our gross margin in ourregulated energy or propane distribution businesses, earnings and cash flows.Our businesses are capital intensive, and the costs of capital projects may be significant.Our businesses are capital intensive and require significant investments in internal infrastructureprojects. Our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if we donot pursue or are unable to manage such capital projects effectively or if full recovery of suchcapital costs is not permitted in future regulatory proceedings.The risk of terrorism and political unrest and the current hostilities in the Middle East mayadversely affect the economy and the price and availability of propane, refined fuels, electricityand natural gas.Terrorist attacks, political unrest and the current hostilities in the Middle East may adverselyaffect the price and availability of propane, refined fuels and natural gas, as well as our resultsof operations, our ability to raise capital and our future growth. The impact that the foregoingmay have on our industry in general, and on us in particular, is not known at this time. An act ofterror could result in disruptions of crude oil, electricity or natural gas supplies and markets,and our infrastructure facilities could be direct or indirect targets. Terrorist activity may alsohinder our ability to transport/transmit propane, electricity and natural gas if our means ofsupply transportation, such as rail, power grid or pipeline, become damaged as a result of anattack. A lower level of economic activity following such events could result in a decline inenergy consumption, which could adversely affect our revenues or restrict our future growth.Instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism could also affect our ability toraise capital. Terrorist activity and hostilities in the Middle East could likely lead to increasedvolatility in prices for propane, refined fuels, electricity and natural gas. We maintain insurancepolicies with insurers in such amounts and with such coverage and deductibles as we believe arereasonable and prudent. There can be no assurance, however, that such insurance will be adequate toprotect us from all material expenses related to potential future claims for personal injury andproperty damage or that such levels of insurance will be available in the future at economicalprices.Operational interruptions to our natural gas transmission and natural gas and electric distributionactivities, caused by accidents, malfunctions, severe weather (such as a major hurricane), apandemic or acts of terrorism, could adversely impact earnings.Inherent in natural gas transmission and natural gas and electric distribution activities are avariety of hazards and operational risks, such as leaks, ruptures, fires, explosions and mechanicalproblems. If they are severe enough or if they lead to operational interruptions, they could causesubstantial financial losses. In addition, these risks could result in the loss of human life,significant damage to property, environmental damage and impairment of our operations. Thelocation of pipeline, storage, transmission and distribution facilities near populated areas,including residential areas, commercial business centers, industrial sites and other publicgathering places, could increase the level of damages resulting from these risks. Our natural gasand electric distribution, natural gas transmission and propane storage facilities may be targetsof terrorist activities that could disrupt our ability to meet customer requirements. Terroristattacks may also disrupt capital markets and our ability to raise capital. A terrorist attack onour facilities, or those of our suppliers or customers, could result in a significant decrease inrevenues or a significant increase in repair costs. The occurrence of any of these events couldadversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Chesapeake Utilities Corporation 2010 Form 10-K     Page 18Table of ContentsOur regulated energy business will be at risk if franchise agreements are not renewed.Our regulated natural gas and electric distribution operations hold franchises in each of theincorporated municipalities that require franchise agreements in order to provide natural gas andelectricity. Our natural gas and electric distribution operations are currently in negotiationsfor franchises with certain municipalities for new service areas and renewal of some existingfranchises. Ongoing financial results would be adversely impacted from the loss of service tocertain operating areas within our electric or natural gas territories in the event that franchiseagreements were not renewed.A strike, work stoppage or a labor dispute could adversely affect our results of operation.We are party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions at some of our Floridaoperations. A strike, work stoppage or a labor dispute with a union or employees represented by aunion could cause interruption to our operations. If a strike, work stoppage or other labordispute were to occur, our results could be adversely affected.Regulatory and Legal RisksRegulation of our Company, including changes in the regulatory environment, may adversely affectour results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.The Delaware, Maryland and Florida PSCs regulate our utility operations in those states. ESNG isregulated by the FERC. These commissions set the rates that we can charge customers for servicessubject to their regulatory jurisdiction. Our ability to obtain timely future rate increases andrate supplements to maintain current rates of return depends on regulatory approvals, and there canbe no assurance that our regulated operations will be able to obtain such approvals or maintaincurrently authorized rates of return. When our earnings from the regulated utilities exceed theauthorized rate of return, these commissions may require us to refund the excess earnings or reduceour rates charged to customers in the future.We are required to detail known benefits, synergies, cost savings and cost increases resulting fromthe FPU merger and present the information in the come-back filing to the Florida PSC by April29, 2011 (within 18 months of the FPU merger). We also intend to seek for the recovery of thepurchase premium and merger-related costs from the FPU merger. We are currently in discussionswith the Office of Public Counsel of Florida regarding the come-back filing and the recovery ofthe purchase premium and merger-related costs. The outcome of such discussions or the ultimateoutcome of the come-back filing, are unknown at this time.We are dependent upon construction of new facilities to support future growth in earnings in ournatural gas and electric distribution and natural gas transmission operations.Construction of new facilities required to support future growth is subject to various regulatoryand developmental risks, including but not limited to: (a) our ability to obtain necessaryapprovals and permits from regulatory agencies on a timely basis and on terms that are acceptableto us; (b) potential changes in federal, state and local statutes and regulations, includingenvironmental requirements, that prevent a project from proceeding or increase the anticipated costof the project; (c) inability to acquire rights-of-way or land rights on a timely basis on termsthat are acceptable to us; (d) lack of anticipated future growth in available natural gas andelectricity supply; and (e) insufficient customer throughput commitments.We are subject to operating and litigation risks that may not be fully covered by insurance.Our operations are subject to the operating hazards and risks normally incidental to handling,storing, transporting/ transmitting and delivering natural gas, electricity and propane to endusers. As a result, we are sometimes a defendant in legal proceedings arising in the ordinarycourse of business. We maintain insurance policies with insurers in the amount of $51 millioncovering general liabilities of our Company, which we believe are reasonable and prudent. Therecan be no assurance, however, that such insurance will be adequate to protect us from all materialexpenses related to potential future claims for personal injury and property damage or that suchlevels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices. Chesapeake Utilities Corporation 2010 Form 10-K     Page 19Table of ContentsWe have recorded significant amounts of goodwill and regulatory assets prior to obtaining arate order. An adverse outcome could result in an impairment of those assets.The merger with FPU and the purchase of the operating assets from IGC resulted in approximately$34.9 million in purchase premium which is currently recorded as goodwill. We intend to seekregulatory approval to include the purchase premium and approximately $2.2 million inmerger-related costs in future rates in Florida. Other utilities in Florida, including Chesapeakeand FPU in the past, have been successful in recovering similar costs by demonstrating benefits tocustomers attributable to the business combination. The ultimate outcome of such regulatoryproceedings will depend on various factors, including but not limited to, our ability todemonstrate the benefits of the merger, the regulatory environment in Florida and the results ofour Florida regulated operations. If we are not successful in obtaining regulatory approval torecover these costs in future rates, we will be required to perform impairment tests of goodwilland regulatory assets, the results of which could be an impairment of all or part of the goodwilland/or regulatory assets in the future.We may face certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change legislation.A number of proposals to limit greenhouse gas emissions, measured in carbon dioxide equivalentunits, are pending, or at least being considered, at regional, federal and international levels.These proposals would require us to measure and potentially limit greenhouse gas emissions from ourenergy operations and our customers or purchase allowances for such emissions. While we cannotpredict with certainty the extent of these limitations or when they will become effective, theseactions could:  increase our costs related to operations, energy efficiency activities and compliance;  affect the demand for natural gas, electricity and propane; and  increase the prices we charge our energy customers.The occurrence of any such legislation could adversely affect our results of operations, financialcondition and cash flows. If our regulated energy operations are unable to recover from customersthrough the regulatory process all or some of these costs and our authorized rate of return onthese costs, this also could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition andcash flows.We may face certain regulatory and financial risks related to pipeline safety legislation.A number of proposals to implement increased oversight over pipeline operations and increasedinvestment in facilities to inspect pipeline facilities, upgrade pipeline facilities, or controlthe impact of a breach of such facilities are pending at the federal level. Additional operatingexpenses and capital expenditures may be necessary to remain in compliance with the increasedfederal oversight resulting from such proposals. While we cannot predict with certainty the extentof these expenses and expenditures or when they will become effective, the adoption of suchlegislation could adversely affect our results of operations, financial conditions and cash flows.If our regulated natural gas operations are unable to recover from customers through the regulatoryprocess all or some of these costs and our authorized rate of return on these costs, this alsocould adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Chesapeake Utilities Corporation 2010 Form 10-K     Page 20Table of ContentsEnvironmental RisksCosts of compliance with environmental laws may be significant.We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental quality andpollution control. These evolving laws and regulations may require expenditures over a long periodof time to control environmental effects at current and former operating sites, including formermanufactured gas plant (MGP) sites that we have acquired from third-parties. Compliance withthese legal obligations requires us to commit capital. If we fail to comply with environmental lawsand regulations, even if such failure is caused by factors beyond our control, we may be assessedcivil or criminal penalties and fines.To date, we have been able to recover, through regulatory rate mechanisms, the costs associatedwith the remediation of former MGP sites. There is no guarantee, however, that we will be able torecover future remediation costs in the same manner or at all. A change in our approved ratemechanisms for recovery of environmental remediation costs at former MGP sites could adverselyaffect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.Further, existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised, or new laws and regulationsseeking to protect the environment may be adopted and be applicable to us. Revised or additionallaws and regulations could result in additional operating restrictions on our facilities orincreased compliance costs, which may not be fully recoverable.Pending environmental matters, particularly with respect to FPUs site in West Palm Beach, Florida,may have a materially adverse effect on our Company and our results of operations.We have participated in the investigation, assessment or remediation of environmental matterswith respect to certain of our properties and we believe our Company has certain exposures at sixformer MGP sites. Those sites are located in Salisbury, Maryland, and Winter Haven, Key West,Pensacola, Sanford and West Palm Beach, Florida. We have also been in discussions with theMaryland Department of the Environment (MDE) regarding a seventh former MGP site located inCambridge, Maryland. The Key West, Pensacola, Sanford and West Palm Beach sites are related to FPU,for which we assumed any existing and future contingencies in the merger with FPU.The site with the most potential exposure is the former West Palm Beach MGP. In November 2010, wepresented a new proposed strategy with an aggressive remedial action plan to expedite remediationof this site, and the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (the FDEP) agreed with theproposal to implement a phased approach. In February 2011, FDEP approved the interim RemedialAction Plan (RAP) for the east parcel of this site, contingent upon certain conditions, and weare currently implementing the plan. Our current estimate of total remediation costs and expensesfor the West Palm Beach site based on the most recently proposed remedial action plan is between$5.1 million and $13.3 million. This estimate does not include any costs associated withrelocation of our operations from the site, which is necessary to implement the remedial action,and any potential costs associated with re-development of the properties. Actual costs may also behigher or lower than the range of current estimate based upon the final remedy required by FDEP.As of December 31, 2010, we had recorded $358,000 in environmental liabilities related toChesapeakes MGP sites in Maryland and Winter Haven, Florida, representing our estimate of thefuture costs associated with those sites. We had recorded approximately $1.3 million in assets forfuture recovery of environmental costs to be received from our customers through our approvedrates. As of December 31, 2010, we had recorded approximately $11.6 million in environmentalliabilities related to FPUs MGP sites in Florida, primarily related to the West Palm Beach site.Such amount represents our estimate as of December 31, 2010, of the future costs associated withthose sites, although FPU is approved to recover its environmental costs up to $14.0 million frominsurance and customers through approved rates. Of the approximately $11.6 million recorded asenvironmental liabilities related to FPUs MGP sites in Florida as of December 31, 2010, we haverecovered approximately $7.8 million of environmental costs from insurance and customers throughrates, and have recorded approximately $6.2 million in assets for future recovery of environmentalcosts to be received from FPUs customers through approved rates. Chesapeake Utilities Corporation 2010 Form 10-K     Page 21Table of ContentsThe costs and expenses we incur to address environmental issues at our sites may have amaterial adverse effect on our results of operations and earnings to the extent that such costs andexpenses exceed the amounts we have accrued as environmental reserves or that we are otherwisepermitted to recover from customers through rates. At present, we believe that the amounts accruedas environmental reserves and that we are otherwise permitted to recover from customers throughrates are sufficient to fund the pending environmental liabilities previously described"
1,CPK,CHESAPEAKE UTILITIES CORP,2010-03-08,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
.The following is a discussion of the primary financial, operational, regulatory and legal, andenvironmental risk factors that may affect the operations and/or financial performance of ourregulated and unregulated businesses. Refer to the section entitled Managements Discussion andAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Item 7 of this report for anadditional discussion of these and other related factors that affect our operations and/orfinancial performance.Financial RisksThe anticipated benefits of the merger with FPU may not be realized.We entered into the merger with FPU with the expectation that the merger would result in variousbenefits, including, among other things, synergies, cost savings and operating efficiencies.Achieving these synergies, cost savings and operating efficiencies cannot be assured and failure toachieve these benefits will adversely affect expected future performance of the Company. Inaddition, the regulatory agencies that have jurisdiction over our regulated energy businesses andoperations may require us to pass on some, or all, of the achieved cost savings to ratepayers.Instability and volatility in the financial markets could have a negative impact on our growthstrategy.Our business strategy includes the continued pursuit of growth, both organically and throughacquisitions. To the extent that we do not generate sufficient cash from operations, we may incuradditional indebtedness to finance our growth. The turmoil experienced in the credit markets in2008 and 2009 and its potential impact on the liquidity of major financial institutions may have anadverse effect on our customers and our ability to fund our business strategy through borrowings,under either existing or newly created arrangements in the public or private markets on terms webelieve to be reasonable. Specifically, we rely on access to both short-term and long-term capitalmarkets as a significant source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by the cashflows from our operations. Currently, $40 million of the total $100 million of short-term lines ofcredit utilized to satisfy our short-term financing requirements are discretionary, uncommittedlines of credit. We utilize discretionary lines of credit to reduce the cost associated with theseshort-term financing requirements. We are committed to maintaining a sound capital structure andstrong credit ratings to provide the financial flexibility needed to access the capital marketswhen required. However, if we are not able to access capital at competitive rates, our ability toimplement our strategic plan, undertake improvements and make other investments required for ourfuture growth may be limited.Page 14     Chesapeake Utilities Corporation 2009 Form 10-K  Table of ContentsUnsound financial institutions could adversely affect the Company.Our businesses have exposure to different industries and counterparties, and may periodicallyexecute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers anddealers, commercial banks, investment banks and other institutional clients. These transactions mayexpose us to credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty or client. There can be noassurance that any such losses or impairments would not materially and adversely affect ourbusinesses and results of operations.A downgrade in our credit rating could adversely affect our access to capital markets and our costof capital.Our ability to obtain adequate and cost-effective capital depends on our credit ratings, which aregreatly affected by our financial performance and the liquidity of financial markets. A downgradein our current credit ratings could adversely affect our access to capital markets, as well as ourcost of capital.Debt covenant obligations, if triggered, may affect our financial condition.Our long-term debt obligations and committed short-term lines of credit contain financial covenantsrelated to debt-to-capital ratios and interest-coverage ratios. Failure to comply with any of thesecovenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in theacceleration of outstanding debt obligations or the inability to borrow under certain creditagreements. Any such acceleration would cause a material adverse change in our financial condition.The continuation of recent economic conditions could adversely affect our customers and negativelyimpact our financial results.The slowdown in the U.S. economy, together with increased unemployment, mortgage and othercredit defaults and significant decreases in the values of homes and investment assets, haveadversely affected the financial resources of many domestic households. It is unclear whethergovernmental responses to these conditions will be successful in lessening the severity or durationof the current recession. As a result, our customers may use less natural gas, electricity orpropane and it may become more difficult for them to pay their bills. This may slow collections andlead to higher than normal levels of accounts receivable, which in turn, could increase ourfinancing requirements and result in higher bad debt expense.Further changes in economic conditions and interest rates may adversely affect our results ofoperations and cash flows.A continued downturn in the economies of the regions in which we operate might adversely affect ourability to increase our customer base and cash flows at historical rates. Further, an increase ininterest rates, without the recovery of the higher cost of debt in the sales and/or transportationrates we charge our utility customers, could adversely affect future earnings. An increase inshort-term interest rates would negatively affect our results of operations, which depend onshort-term lines of credit to finance accounts receivable and storage gas inventories, and totemporarily finance capital expenditures.Inflation may impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.Inflation affects the cost of supply, labor, products and services required for operations,maintenance and capital improvements. To help cope with the effects of inflation on our capitalinvestments and returns, we seek rate increases from regulatory commissions for regulatedoperations and closely monitor the returns of our unregulated operations. There can be no assurancethat we will be able to obtain adequate and timely rate increases to offset the effects ofinflation. To compensate for fluctuations in propane gas prices, we adjust our propane sellingprices to the extent allowed by the market. There can be no assurance, however, that we will beable to increase propane sales prices sufficiently to compensate fully for such fluctuations in thecost of propane gas to us.Chesapeake Utilities Corporation 2009 Form 10-K     Page 15  Table of ContentsOur operations are exposed to market risks, beyond our control, which could adversely affect ourfinancial results and capital requirements.Our natural gas marketing operation and propane wholesale marketing operation are subject tomarket risks beyond their control, including market liquidity and commodity price volatility.Although we maintain a risk management policy, we may not be able to offset completely the pricerisk associated with volatile commodity prices, which could lead to volatility in earnings.Physical trading also has price risk on any net open positions at the end of each trading day, aswell as volatility resulting from: (i) intra-day fluctuations of natural gas and/or propane prices,and (ii) daily price movements between the time natural gas and/or propane is purchased or sold forfuture delivery and the time the related purchase or sale is hedged. The determination of our netopen position at the end of any trading day requires Xeron to make assumptions as to futurecircumstances, including the use of natural gas and/or propane by its customers in relation to itsanticipated market positions. Because the price risk associated with any net open position at theend of such day may increase if the assumptions are not realized, we review these assumptionsdaily. Net open positions may increase volatility in our financial condition or results ofoperations if market prices move in a significantly favorable or unfavorable manner, because thetiming of the recognition of profits or losses on the economic hedges for financial accountingpurposes usually does not match up with the timing of the economic profits or losses on the itembeing hedged. This volatility may occur, with a resulting increase or decrease in earnings orlosses, even though the expected profit margin is essentially unchanged from the date thetransactions were consummated.Our energy marketing subsidiaries have credit risk and credit requirements that may adverselyaffect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.Our energy marketing subsidiaries extend credit to counterparties and continually monitor andmanage collections aggressively. Each of these subsidiaries is exposed to the risk that it may notbe able to collect amounts owed to it. If the counterparty to such a transaction fails to perform,and any underlying collateral is inadequate, we could experience financial losses. Thesesubsidiaries are also dependent upon the availability of credit to buy propane and natural gas forresale or to trade. If financial market conditions decline generally, or the financial condition ofthese subsidiaries or of the Company declines, then the cost of credit available to thesesubsidiaries could increase. If credit is not available, or if credit is more costly, our resultsof operations, cash flows and financial condition may be adversely affected.Current market conditions have had an adverse impact on the return on plan assets for our pensionplans, which may require significant additional funding and adversely affect the Companys cashflows.We have pension plans that have been closed to new employees. The costs of providing benefits andrelated funding requirements of these plans are subject to changes in the market value of theassets that fund the plans. As a result ofthe extreme volatility and disruption in the domestic and international equity and bond markets inrecent years, the asset values of Chesapeakes and FPUs pension plans declined by $2.4 million and$2.8 million, respectively, since 2008. The funded status of the plans and the related costsreflected in our financial statements are affected by various factors that are subject to aninherent degree of uncertainty, particularly in the current economic environment. Future losses ofasset values may necessitate accelerated funding of the plans in the future to meet minimum federalgovernment requirements. Downward pressure on the asset values of our pension plans may require usto fund obligations earlier than originally planned, which would have an adverse impact on our cashflows from operations, decrease borrowing capacity and increase interest expense.Operational RisksWe may be unable to successfully integrate operations after the merger.The merger between Chesapeake and FPU involves the integration of two companies that havepreviously operated independently. The difficulties of combining the companies operations include,among other things:  the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations, systems and facilities;  combining the best practices of the two companies, including operations, financial andadministrative functions; and  integrating personnel with diverse business backgrounds and different contractual termsand conditions of employment.Page 16     Chesapeake Utilities Corporation 2009 Form 10-K  Table of ContentsThe process of integrating operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, theactivities of one or more of our businesses and the loss of key personnel. We will be subject toemployee workforce factors, including loss of employees, availability of qualified personnel,collective bargaining agreements with unions and work stoppages that could affect our business andfinancial condition. Our management team comprised of key personnel from both Chesapeake and FPUhas dedicated substantial efforts to integrating the businesses. Such efforts could divertmanagements focus and resources from other strategic opportunities during the integration process.The diversion of managements attention and any delays or difficulties encountered in connectionwith the merger and the integration of the two companies operations could result in the disruptionof our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies thatadversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, employees andothers with whom we have business dealings.Fluctuations in weather may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financialcondition.Our natural gas and propane distribution operations are sensitive to fluctuations in weatherconditions, which directly influence the volume of natural gas and propane sold and delivered. Asignificant portion of our natural gas and propane distribution revenues is derived from the salesand deliveries of natural gas and propane to residential and commercial heating customers duringthe five-month peak heating season (November through March). If the weather is warmer than normal,we sell and deliver less natural gas and propane to customers, and earn less revenue. In addition,hurricanes or other extreme weather conditions could damage production or transportationfacilities, which could result in decreased supplies of natural gas, propane and electricity,increased supply costs and higher prices for customers.Our electric operations, while generally less weather sensitive than natural gas and propane sales,are also affected by variations in general weather conditions and unusually severe weather.The amount and availability of natural gas, electricity and propane supplies are difficult topredict; a substantial reduction in available supplies could reduce our earnings in those segments.Natural gas, electricity and propane production can be affected by factors beyond our control, suchas weather, closings of generation facilities and refineries. If we are unable to obtain sufficientnatural gas, electricity and propane supplies to meet demand, results in those businesses may beadversely affected.We rely on a limited number of natural gas, electric and propane suppliers, the loss of which couldhave a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.Our natural gas distribution and marketing operations, electric distribution operation and propaneoperations have entered into various agreements with suppliers to purchase natural gas, electricityand propane to serve their customers. The loss of any significant suppliers or our inability torenew these contracts at favorable terms upon their expiration could significantly affect ourability to serve our customers and have a material adverse impact on our financial condition andresults of operations.We rely on having access to interstate natural gas pipelines transmission and storage capacity andelectric transmission capacity; a substantial disruption or lack of growth in these services mayimpair our ability to meet customers existing and future requirements.In order to meet existing and future customer demands for natural gas and electricity, we mustacquire both sufficient natural gas supplies, interstate pipeline transmission and storagecapacity, and electric transmission capacity to serve such requirements. We must contract forreliable and adequate delivery capacity for our distribution systems while considering the dynamicsof the interstate pipeline and storage and electric transmission markets, our own on-systemresources, as well as the characteristics of our markets. Our financial condition and results ofoperations would be materially and adversely affected if the future availability of thesecapacities were insufficient to meet future customer demands for natural gas and electricity.Currently, all of FPUs natural gas is transported through one pipeline system. Any interruption tothat system could adversely affect our ability to meet the demands of FPUs customers and ourearnings.Chesapeake Utilities Corporation 2009 Form 10-K     Page 17  Table of ContentsCommodity price changes may affect the operating costs and competitive positions of our naturalgas, electric and propane distribution operations, which may adversely affect our results ofoperations, cash flows and financial condition.Natural Gas/Electric. Higher natural gas prices can significantly increase the cost of gasbilled to our natural gas customers. Increases in the cost of coal and other fuels cansignificantly increase the cost of electricity billed to our electric customers. Such costincreases generally have no immediate effect on our revenues and net income because of ourregulated fuel cost recovery mechanisms. Our net income, however, may be reduced by higher expensesthat we may incur for uncollectible customer accounts and by lower volumes of natural gas andelectricity deliveries when customers reduce their consumption. Therefore, increases in the priceof natural gas, coal and other fuels can affect our operating cash flows and the competitiveness ofnatural gas/electricity as energy sources and consequently have an adverse effect on our operatingcash flows.Propane. Propane costs are subject to volatile changes as a result of product supply orother market conditions, including weather and economic and political factors affecting crude oiland natural gas supply or pricing. Such cost changes can occur rapidly and can affectprofitability. There is no assurance that we will be able to pass on propane cost increases fullyor immediately, particularly when propane costs increase rapidly. Therefore, average retail salesprices can vary significantly from year to year as product costs fluctuate in response to propane,fuel oil, crude oil and natural gas commodity market conditions. In addition, in periods ofsustained higher commodity prices, declines in retail sales volumes due to reduced consumption andincreased amounts of uncollectible accounts may adversely affect net income.Our propane inventory is subject to inventory risk, which may adversely affect our results ofoperations and financial condition.Our propane distribution operations own bulk propane storage facilities, with an aggregate capacityof approximately 3.0 million gallons. We purchase and store propane based on several factors,including inventory levels and the price outlook. We may purchase large volumes of propane atcurrent market prices during periods of low demand and low prices, which generally occur during thesummer months. Propane is a commodity, and, as such, its unit price is subject to volatilefluctuations in response to changes in supply or other market conditions. We have no control overthese market conditions. Consequently, the unit price of the propane that we purchase can changerapidly over a short period of time. The market price for propane could fall below the price atwhich we made the purchases, which would adversely affect our profits or cause sales from thatinventory to be unprofitable. In addition, falling propane prices may result in inventorywrite-downs as required by U.S. generally acceptedaccounting principles (GAAP) if the market price of propane falls below our weighted average costof inventory, which could adversely affect net income.Operating events affecting public safety and the reliability our natural gas and electricdistribution systems could adversely affect the results of operations, cash flows and financialcondition.Our business is exposed to operational events, such as major leaks, mechanical problems andaccidents, that could affect the public safety and reliability of our natural gas distribution andtransmission systems, significantly increase costs and cause loss of customer confidence. Theoccurrence of any such operational events could adversely affect the results of operations,financial condition and cash flows. If we are unable to recover from customers, through theregulatory process, all or some of these costs and our authorized rate of return on these costs,this also could adversely affect the results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Our electric operation is subject to various operational risks, including accidents, outages,equipment breakdowns or failures, or operations below expected levels of performance or efficiency.Problems such as the breakdown or failure of electric equipment or processes and interruptions inservice which would result in performance below expected levels of output or efficiency,particularly if extended for prolonged periods of time, could have a materially adverse effect onour financial condition and results of operations.Page 18     Chesapeake Utilities Corporation 2009 Form 10-K  Table of ContentsBecause we operate in a competitive environment, we may lose customers to competitors which couldadversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.Natural Gas. Our natural gas marketing operations compete with third-party suppliers tosell natural gas to commercial and industrial customers. Our natural gas transmission anddistribution operations compete with interstate pipelines when our transmission and/or distributioncustomers are located close enough to a competing pipeline to make direct connections economicallyfeasible. Failure to retain and grow our customer base in the natural gas operations would have anadverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.Electric. While there is active wholesale power sales competition in Florida, our retailelectric business through FPU has remained substantially free from direct competition. Changes inthe competitive environment caused by legislation, regulation, market conditions or initiatives ofother electric power providers, particularly with respect to retail competition, could adverselyaffect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.Propane. Our propane distribution operations compete with other propane distributors,primarily on the basis of service and price. Some of our competitors have significantly greaterresources. Our ability to grow the propane distribution business is contingent upon capturingadditional market share, expanding new service territories, and successfully utilizing pricingprograms that retain and grow our customer base. Failure to retain and grow our customer base inour propane gas operations would have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flowsand financial condition.Our propane wholesale marketing operations will compete against various marketers, many of whichhave significantly greater resources and are able to obtain price or volumetric advantages.Changes in technology may adversely affect our advanced information services subsidiarys resultsof operations, cash flows and financial condition.BravePoint participates in a market that is characterized by rapidly changing technology andaccelerating product introduction cycles. The success of our advanced information servicesoperation depends upon our ability to address the rapidly changing needs of our customers bydeveloping and supplying high-quality, cost-effective products, product enhancements and services,on a timely basis, and by keeping pace with technological developments and emerging industrystandards. There is no assurance that we will be able to keep up with technological advancements tothe degree necessary to keep our products and services competitive.Our use of derivative instruments may adversely affect our results of operations.Fluctuating commodity prices may affect our earnings and financing costs because our propanedistribution and wholesale marketing operations use derivative instruments, including forwards,futures, swaps and puts, to hedge price risk. In addition, we have utilized in the past, and maydecide, after further evaluation, to continue to utilize derivative instruments to hedge pricerisk. While we have a risk management policy and operating procedures in place to control ourexposure to risk, if we purchase derivative instruments that are not properly matched to ourexposure, our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition may be adversely affected.Changes in customer growth may affect earnings and cash flows.Our ability to increase gross margins in our regulated energy and unregulated propane distributionbusinesses is dependent upon growth in the residential construction market, adding new commercialand industrial customers and conversion of customers to natural gas, electricity or propane fromother fuel sources. Slowdowns in these markets have and will continue to adversely affect our grossmargin in our regulated energy or propane distribution businesses, earnings and cash flows.Our businesses are capital intensive, and the costs of capital projects may be significant.Our businesses are capital intensive and require significant investments in internal infrastructureprojects. Our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected if we donot pursue or are unable to manage such capital projects effectively or if full recovery of suchcapital costs is not permitted in future regulatory proceedings.ChesapeakeUtilities Corporation 2009 Form 10-K     Page 19  Table of ContentsOur facilities and operations could be targets of acts of terrorism.Our natural gas and electric distribution, natural gas transmission and propane storagefacilities may be targets of terrorist activities that could disrupt our ability to meet customerrequirements. Terrorist attacks may also disrupt capital markets and our ability to raise capital.A terrorist attack on our facilities, or those of our suppliers or customers, could result in asignificant decrease in revenues or a significant increase in repair costs, which could adverselyaffect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.The risk of terrorism and political unrest and the current hostilities in the Middle East mayadversely affect the economy and the price and availability of propane, refined fuels, electricityand natural gas.Terrorist attacks, political unrest and the current hostilities in the Middle East may adverselyaffect the price and availability of propane, refined fuels and natural gas, as well as our resultsof operations, our ability to raise capital and our future growth. The impact that the foregoingmay have on our industry in general, and on us in particular, is not known at this time. An act ofterror could result in disruptions of crude oil, electricity or natural gas supplies and markets,and our infrastructure facilities could be direct or indirect targets. Terrorist activity may alsohinder our ability to transport/transmit propane, electricity and natural gas if our means ofsupply transportation, such as rail, power grid or pipeline, become damaged as a result of anattack. A lower level of economic activity following such events could result in a decline inenergy consumption, which could adversely affect our revenues or restrict our future growth.Instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism could also affect our ability toraise capital. Terrorist activity and hostilities in the Middle East could likely lead to increasedvolatility in prices for propane, refined fuels, electricity and natural gas. We maintain insurancepolicies with insurers in such amounts and with such coverage and deductibles as we believe arereasonable and prudent. There can be no assurance, however, that such insurance will be adequate toprotect us from all material expenses related to potential future claims for personal injury andproperty damage or that such levels of insurance will be available in the future at economicalprices.Operational interruptions to our natural gas transmission and natural gas and electric distributionactivities, caused by accidents, malfunctions, severe weather (such as a major hurricane), apandemic or acts of terrorism, could adversely impact earnings.Inherent in natural gas transmission and natural gas and electric distribution activities are avariety of hazards and operational risks, such as leaks, ruptures, fires, explosions and mechanicalproblems. If they are severe enough or ifthey lead to operational interruptions, they could cause substantial financial losses. In addition,these risks could result in the loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmentaldamage and impairment of our operations. The location of pipeline, storage, transmission anddistribution facilities near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial businesscenters, industrial sites and other public gathering places, could increase the level of damagesresulting from these risks. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect ourresults of operations, cash flows and financial condition.Our regulated energy business will be at risk if franchise agreements are not renewed.Our regulated natural gas and electric distribution operations hold franchises in each of theincorporated municipalities that require franchise agreements in order to provide natural gas andelectricity. Our natural gas and electric distribution operations are currently in negotiations forfranchises with certain municipalities for new service areas and renewal of some existingfranchises. Ongoing financial results would be adversely impacted from the loss of service tocertain operating areas within our electric or natural gas territories in the event that franchiseagreements were not renewed.A strike, work stoppage or a labor dispute could adversely affect our results of operation.We are party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions at some of our Floridaoperations. A strike, work stoppage or a labor dispute with a union or employees represented by aunion could cause interruption to our operations. If a strike, work stoppage or other labordispute were to occur, our results could be adversely affected.Page 20     Chesapeake Utilities Corporation 2009 Form 10-K  Table of ContentsRegulatory and Legal RisksRegulation of the Company, including changes in the regulatory environment, may adversely affectour results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.The Delaware, Maryland and Florida PSCs regulate our utility operations in those states. ESNG isregulated by the FERC. These commissions set the rates that we can charge customers for servicessubject to their regulatory jurisdiction. Our ability to obtain timely future rate increases andrate supplements to maintain current rates of return depends on regulatory approvals, and there canbe no assurance that our regulated operations will be able to obtain such approvals or maintaincurrently authorized rates of return.We are dependent upon construction of new facilities to support future growth in earnings in ournatural gas and electric distribution and natural gas transmission operations.Construction of new facilities required to support future growth is subject to various regulatoryand developmental risks, including but not limited to: (a) our ability to obtain necessaryapprovals and permits from regulatory agencies on a timely basis and on terms that are acceptableto us; (b) potential changes in federal, state and local statutes and regulations, includingenvironmental requirements, that prevent a project from proceeding or increase the anticipated costof the project; (c) inability to acquire rights-of-way or land rights on a timely basis on termsthat are acceptable to us; (d) lack of anticipated future growth in available natural gas andelectricity supply; and (e) insufficient customer throughput commitments.We are subject to operating and litigation risks that may not be fully covered by insurance.Our operations are subject to the operating hazards and risks normally incidental to handling,storing, transporting/ transmitting and delivering natural gas, electricity and propane to endusers. As a result, we are sometimes a defendant in legal proceedings arising in the ordinarycourse of business. We maintain insurance policies with insurers in the amount of $50 millioncovering general liabilities of the Company, which we believe are reasonable and prudent. There canbe no assurance, however, that such insurance will be adequate to protect us from all materialexpenses related to potential future claims for personal injury and property damage or that suchlevels of insurance will be available in the future at economical prices.We have recorded significant amounts of goodwill and regulatory assets prior to obtaining a rateorder. An adverse outcome could result in an impairment of those assets.The merger with FPU resulted in approximately $33.4 million in purchase premium which is currentlyrecorded as goodwill. We also incurred approximately $3.0 million in merger-related costs, $1.5million of which was deferred as a regulatory asset. We will be seeking regulatory approval toinclude these amounts in future rates in Florida. Other utilities in Florida, including Chesapeakeand FPU in the past, have been successful in recovering similar costs by demonstrating benefits tocustomers attributable to the business combination. The ultimate outcome of such regulatoryproceedings will depend on various factors, including but not limited to, our ability to achievethe anticipated benefits of the merger, the future regulatory environment in Florida and the futureresults of our Florida regulated operations. If we are not successful in obtaining regulatoryapproval to recover these costs in future rates, we will be required to perform impairment tests ofgoodwill and regulatory assets, the results of which could be an impairment of all or part of thegoodwill and/or regulatory assets in the future.Environmental RisksCosts of compliance with environmental laws may be significant.We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental quality andpollution control. These evolving laws and regulations may require expenditures over a long periodof time to control environmental effects at current and former operating sites, including formermanufactured gas plant (MGP) sites that we have acquired from third-parties. Compliance withthese legal obligations requires us to commit capital. If we fail to comply with environmental lawsand regulations, even if such failure is caused by factors beyond our control, we may be assessedcivil or criminal penalties and fines.Chesapeake Utilities Corporation 2009 Form 10-K     Page 21  Table of ContentsTo date, we have been able to recover, through regulatory rate mechanisms, the costs associatedwith the remediation of former MGP sites. There is no guarantee, however, that we will be able torecover future remediation costs in the same manner or at all. A change in our approved ratemechanisms for recovery of environmental remediation costs at former MGP sites could adverselyaffect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.Further, existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised, or new laws and regulationsseeking to protect the environment may be adopted and be applicable to us. Revised or additionallaws and regulations could result in additional operating restrictions on our facilities orincreased compliance costs, which may not be fully recoverable.We may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change.Climate change is receiving ever increasing attention from scientists, legislators and regulatorsalike. The debate is ongoing as to the extent to which our climate is changing, the potentialcauses of this change and its potential impacts. Some attribute global warming to increased levelsof greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, which has led to significant legislative andregulatory efforts to limit greenhouse gas emissions.There are a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to address greenhouse gas emissions,which are in various phases of discussion or implementation. The outcome of federal and stateactions to address global climate change could result in a variety of regulatory programs,including potential new regulations, additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities, orother regulatory actions. These actions could:  result in increased costs associated with our operations;  increase other costs to our business;  affect the demand for natural gas, electricity and propane; and  impact the prices we charge our customers.Any action taken by federal or state governments mandating a substantial reduction in greenhousegas emissions could have far-reaching and significant impacts on the energy industry. We cannotpredict the potential impact of such laws or regulations on our future consolidated financialcondition, results of operations or cash flows.Pending environmental matters, particularly with respect to FPUs site in West Palm Beach, Florida,may have a materially adverse effect on the Company and our results of operations.We have participated in the investigation, assessment or remediation of environmental matters withrespect to certain of our properties and we believe the Company has certain exposures at six formerMGP sites. Those sites are located in Salisbury, Maryland, and WinterHaven, Key West, Pensacola, Sanford and West Palm Beach, Florida. We have also been in discussionswith the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) regarding a seventh former MGP site locatedin Cambridge, Maryland. The Key West, Pensacola, Sanford and West Palm Beach sites are related toFPU, for which we assumed any existing and future contingencies in the merger with FPU.Pursuant to a consent order that FPU entered into with the Florida Department of EnvironmentalProtection (the FDEP) prior to our merger with FPU, FPU is obligated to assess and remediateenvironmental impacts to soil and groundwater resulting from operation of the former West PalmBeach MGP. Following completion of the assessment task, FPU retained a consultant to perform afeasibility study to evaluate appropriate remedies for the site to respond to the reportedenvironmental impacts. The feasibility study was performed and subsequently revised as a result ofadditional testing conducted at the site and extensive discussions with FDEP. The revisedfeasibility study evaluates several alternative remedies for the site. Discussions with FDEP arecontinuing, regarding selection of an appropriate remedy for the West Palm Beach site. Our currentestimate of total remediation costs and expenses, including legal and consulting expenses, for theWest Palm Beach site based on the likely remedy we believe will be approved by FDEP is between $7.8million and $19.4 million; however, actual costs may be higher or lower than such range based uponthe final remedy required by FDEP.Page 22     Chesapeake Utilities Corporation 2009 Form 10-K  Table of ContentsAs of December 31, 2009, we hadrecorded $531,000 in environmental liabilities related toChesapeakes MGP sites in Maryland and Winter Haven, Florida, representing our estimate of thefuture costs associated with those sites. We had recorded approximately $1.7 million in assets forfuture recovery of environmental costs to be received from our customers through our approvedrates. As of December 31, 2009, we had recorded approximately $12.3 million in environmentalliabilities related to FPUs MGP sites in Florida, primarily related to the West Palm Beach site.Such amount represents our estimate as of December 31, 2009, of the future costs associated withthose sites, although FPU is approved to recover its environmental costs up to $14.0 million frominsurance and customers through approved rates. Of the approximately $12.3 million recorded asenvironmental liabilities related to FPUs MGP sites in Florida as of December 31, 2009, we haverecovered approximately $5.7 million of environmental costs from insurance and customers throughrates, and have recorded approximately $6.6 million in assets for future recovery of environmentalcosts to be received from FPUs customers through approved rates.The costs and expenses we incur to address environmental issues at our sites may have a materialadverse effect on our results of operations and earnings to the extent that such costs and expensesexceed the amounts we have accrued as environmental reserves or that we are otherwise permitted torecover from customers through rates,. At present, we believe that the amounts accrued asenvironmental reserves and that we are otherwise permitted to recover from customers through ratesare sufficient to fund the pending environmental liabilities described above"
4,CPK,CHESAPEAKE UTILITIES CORP,2009-03-09,">Item 1A. Risk Factors
.The following is a discussion of the primary financial, operational, regulatory and legal, andenvironmental risk factors that may affect the operations and/or financial performance of theregulated and unregulated businesses of Chesapeake. Refer to the section entitled ManagementsDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under Item 7 of thisreport for an additional discussion of these and other related factors that affect the Companysoperations and/or financial performance.Financial RisksInstability and volatility in the financial markets could have a negative impact on our growth strategy.Our business strategy includes the continued pursuit of growth, both organically and through acquisitions. To theextent that we do not generate sufficient cash from operations, we may incur additional indebtedness to finance ourgrowth. The turmoil experienced in the credit markets during 2008 and its potential impact on the liquidity of majorfinancial institutions may have an adverse effect on our ability to fund our business strategy through borrowings,under either existing or newly created arrangements in the public or private markets on terms we believe to bereasonable. Specifically, we rely on access to both short-term and longer-term capital markets as a significant sourceof liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from our operations. Currently, $45 million of thetotal $100 million of short-term lines of credit utilized to satisfy our short-term financing requirements arediscretionary, uncommitted lines of credit. We utilize discretionary lines of credit to reduce the cost associated withthese short-term financing requirements. We are committed to maintaining a sound capital structure and strong creditratings to provide the financial flexibility needed to access the capital markets when required. However, if we are notable to access capital at competitive rates, our ability to implement our strategic plan, undertake improvements andmake other investments required for our future growth may be limited.Current levels of market volatility are unprecedented.The capital and credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption for more than twelve months. Inrecent weeks, the volatility and disruption have reached unprecedented levels. In some cases, the markets have exerteddownward pressure on stock prices and credit capacity for certain issuers. There is no assurance that recent governmentintervention to help stabilize credit markets and financial institutions and restore liquidity will have beneficialeffects in the credit markets, will address credit or liquidity issues of companies that participate in the programs orwill reduce volatility or uncertainty in the financial markets. If current levels of market disruption and volatilitycontinue or worsen, we would seek to meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lendingagreements primarily provided by banks and/or by seeking other funding sources. Under such extreme market conditions,however, there can be no assurance that such agreements and other funding sources would be available or sufficient.Page 12     Chesapeake Utilities Corporation 2008 Form 10-K  Table of ContentsDifficult conditions in the financial services markets have materially and adversely affected thebusiness and results of operations of many financial institutions, and we do not know when and ifthese conditions may improve in the near future.Dramatic declines in the housing market during the past year, with falling home prices andincreasing foreclosures and unemployment, have resulted in significant write-downs of asset valuesby financial institutions, including government-sponsored entities and major commercial andinvestment banks. These write-downs, initially representing mortgage-backed securities but morerecently including credit default swaps and other derivative securities, have caused many financialinstitutions to seek additional capital, to merge with larger and stronger institutions and, insome cases, to fail. Many lenders and institutional investors have reduced and, in some cases,ceased to provide funding to borrowers, including other financial institutions. This market turmoiland tightening of credit have led to an increased level of commercial and consumer delinquencies,lack of consumer confidence, increased market volatility and widespread reduction of businessactivity generally.The unsoundness of financial institutions could adversely affect the Company.The Company has exposure to different industries and counterparties, and may periodically executetransactions with counterparties in the financial services industry, including brokers and dealers,commercial banks, investment banks and other institutional clients. These transactions may exposethe Company to credit risk in the event of default of a counterparty or client. There can be noassurance that any such losses or impairments would not materially and adversely affect theCompanys business and results of operations.A downgrade in our credit rating could adversely affect our access to capital markets.Our ability to obtain adequate and cost-effective capital depends on our credit ratings, which aregreatly affected by our financial performance and the liquidity of financial markets. A downgradein our current credit ratings could adversely affect our access to capital markets, as well as ourcost of capital.Debt covenant obligations, if triggered, may affect our financial condition.Our long-term debt obligations and committed short-term lines of credit contain financial covenantsrelated to debt-to-capital ratios and interest-coverage ratios. Failure to comply with any of thesecovenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in theacceleration of outstanding debt obligations or the inability to borrow under certain creditagreements. Any such acceleration would cause a material adverse change in Chesapeakes financialcondition.The continuation of recent economic conditions could adversely affect our customers and negativelyimpact our financial results.The slowdown in the U.S. economy, together with increased unemployment, mortgage and other creditdefaults and significant decreases in the values of homes and investment assets, have adverselyaffected the financial resources of many domestic households. It is unclear whether governmentalresponses to these conditions will be successful in lessening the severity or duration of thecurrent recession. As a result, our customers may use less gas or propane and/or it may become moredifficult for them to pay their gas or propane bills. This may slow collections and lead to higherthan normal levels of accounts receivable, which in turn, could increase our financing requirementsand result in higher bad debt expense.Chesapeake Utilities Corporation 2008 Form 10-K     Page 13  Table of ContentsFurther changes in economic conditions and interest rates may adversely affect our results ofoperations and cash flows.A continued downturn in the economies of the regions in which we operate might adversely affect ourability to increase our customer base and cash flows at historical rates. Further, an increase ininterest rates, without the recovery of the higher cost of debt in the sales and/or transportationrates we charge our utility customers, could adversely affect future earnings. An increase inshort-term interest rates would negatively affect our results of operations, which depend onshort-term lines of credit to finance accounts receivable and storage gas inventories, and totemporarily finance capital expenditures.Inflation may impact our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.Inflation affects the cost of supply, labor, products and services required for operations,maintenance and capital improvements. To help cope with the effects of inflation on our capitalinvestments and returns, we seek rate relief from regulatory commissions for regulated operationsand closely monitor the returns of our unregulated business operations. There can be no assurancethat we will be able to obtain adequate and timely rate relief to offset the effects of inflation.To compensate for fluctuations in propane gas prices, we adjust our propane selling prices to theextent allowed by the market. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to increasepropane sales prices sufficiently to compensate fully for such fluctuations in the cost of propanegas to us.Currentmarket conditions have had a negative impact on the return on planassets for our pension plan, which may require additional funding and negatively affect our cash flows.We have a pension plan that has been closed to new employees since January 1, 1999. Thecosts of providing benefits and related funding requirements of this plan are subject to changes inthe market value of the assets that fund the plan. As a result of the extreme volatility anddisruption in the domestic and international equity and bond markets, our pension planexperienced a decline of $4.3 million in its asset values during the year. The funded status of theplan and the related costs reflected in our financial statements are affected by various factorsthat are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty, particularly in the current economicenvironment. Under the Pension Protection Act of 2006, continued losses of asset values maynecessitate accelerated funding of the plan in the future to meet minimum federal governmentrequirements. Continued downward pressure on the asset values of theplan may require usto fund obligations earlier than it had originally planned, which would have a negative impact onour cash flows from operations, decrease borrowing capacity and increase interest expense.Our operations are exposed to market risks, beyond our control, which could adversely affect ourfinancial results and capital requirements.Our PESCO and Xeron operations are subject to market risks beyond our control, including marketliquidity and commodity price volatility. Although we maintain a risk management policy, we may notbe able to offset completely the price risk associated with volatile commodity prices, which couldlead to volatility in our earnings. Physical trading also has price risk on any net open positionsat the end of each trading day, as well as volatility resulting from: (i) intra-day fluctuations ofgas and/or propane prices, and (ii) daily price movements between the time natural gas and/orpropane is purchased or sold for future delivery and the time the related purchase or sale ishedged. The determination of our net open position at the end of any trading day requires us tomake assumptions as to future circumstances, including the use of gas and/or propane by ourcustomers in relation to our anticipated market positions. Because the price risk associated withany net open position at the end of such day may increase if the assumptions are not realized, wereview these assumptions daily. Net open positions may increase volatility in our financialcondition or results of operations if market prices move in a significantly favorable orunfavorable manner, because the timing of the recognition of profits or losses on the hedges forfinancial accounting purposes usually does not match up with the timing of the economic profits orlosses on the item being hedged. This volatility may occur, with a resulting increase or decreasein earnings or losses, even though the expected profit margin is essentially unchanged from thedate the transactions were consummated.Page 14     Chesapeake Utilities Corporation 2008 Form 10-K  Table of ContentsOperational RisksFluctuations in weather may adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financialcondition.Our natural gas and propane distribution operations are sensitive to fluctuations in weatherconditions, which directly influence the volume of natural gas and propane sold and delivered. Asignificant portion of our natural gas and propane distribution revenues is derived from the salesand deliveries of natural gas and propane to residential and commercial heating customers duringthe five-month peak heating season (November through March). If the weather is warmer than normal,we sell and deliver less natural gas and propane to customers, and earn less revenue. In addition,hurricanes or other extreme weather conditions could damage production or transportationfacilities, which could result in decreased supplies of natural gas and propane, increased supplycosts and higher prices for customers.The amount and availability of natural gas and propane supplies are difficult to predict; asubstantial reduction in available supplies could reduce our earnings in those segments.Natural gas and propane production can be affected by factors beyond our control, such as weatherand refinery closings. If we are unable to obtain sufficient natural gas and propane supplies tomeet demand, results in those segments may be adversely affected.We rely on having access to interstate natural gas pipelines transportation and storage capacity;a substantial disruption or lack of growth in these services may impair our ability to meetcustomers existing and future requirements.In order to meet existing and future customer demands for natural gas, we must acquire bothsufficient natural gas supplies and interstate pipeline and storage capacity to serve suchrequirements. We must contract for reliable and adequate delivery capacity for our distributionsystems while considering the dynamics of the interstate pipeline and storage capacity market, ourown on-system resources, as well as the characteristics of our markets. Chesapeake, along withother local natural gas distribution companies and other participants in the industry, has voicedconcern regarding the future availability of additional upstream interstate pipeline and storagecapacity. This is a business issue which we must continue to manage as our customer base grows.Natural gas and propane commodity price changes may affect the operating costs and competitivepositions of our natural gas and propane distribution operations, which may adversely affect ourresults of operations, cash flows and financial condition.Natural Gas. Higher natural gas prices can significantly increase the cost of gas billed toour customers. Such cost increases generally have no immediate effect on our revenues and netincome because of our regulated gas recovery mechanisms. Our net income, however, may be reduced byhigher expenses that we may incur for uncollectible customer accounts and by lower volumes ofnatural gas deliveries when customers reduce their consumption. Therefore, increases in the priceof natural gas can affect our operating cash flows and the competitiveness of natural gas as anenergy source.Propane. Propane costs are subject to volatile changes as a result of product supply orother market conditions, including economic and political factors affecting crude oil and naturalgas supply or pricing. Such cost changes can occur rapidly and can affect profitability. There isno assurance that we will be able to pass on propane cost increases fully or immediately,particularly when propane costs increase rapidly. Therefore, average retail sales prices can varysignificantly from year-to-year as product costs fluctuate in response to propane, fuel oil, crudeoil and natural gas commodity market conditions. In addition, in periods of sustained highercommodity prices, declines in retail sales volumes due to reduced consumption and increased amountsof uncollectible accounts may adversely affect net income.Our propane inventory is subject to inventory risk, which may adversely affect our results ofoperations and financial condition.The Companys propane distribution operations own bulk propane storage facilities, with anaggregate capacity of approximately 2.5 million gallons. We purchase and store propane based onseveral factors, including inventory levels and the price outlook. We may purchase large volumes ofpropane at current market prices during periods of low demand and low prices, which generally occurduring the summer months. Propane is a commodity, and, as such, its unit price is subject tovolatile fluctuations in response to changes in supply or other market conditions. We have nocontrol over these market conditions. Consequently, the unit price of the propane that we purchasecan change rapidly over a short period of time. The market price for propane could fall below theprice at which we made the purchases, which would adversely affect our profits or cause sales fromthat inventory to be unprofitable. In addition, falling propane prices may result in inventorywrite-downs as required by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) if the market price ofpropane falls below our weighted average cost of inventory, and therefore, could adversely affectnet income.Chesapeake Utilities Corporation 2008 Form 10-K     Page 15  Table of ContentsOperating events affecting public safety and the reliability of Chesapeakes natural gasdistribution system could adversely affect the results of operations, financial condition and cashflows.Chesapeakes business is exposed to operational events, such as major leaks, mechanical problemsand accidents, that could affect the public safety and reliability of its natural gas distributionsystems, significantly increase costs and cause loss of customer confidence. The occurrence of anysuch operational events could adversely affect the results of operations, financial condition andcash flows. If Chesapeake is unable to recover from customers, through the regulatory process, allor some of these costs and its authorized rate of return on these costs, this also could adverselyaffect the results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Because we operate in a competitive environment, we may lose customers to competitors.PESCO competes with third-party suppliers to sell gas to commercial and industrial customers. Inour gas transportation and distribution operations, our competitors include interstate pipelines,when our transmission and/or distribution customers are located close enough to a competingpipeline to make direct connections economically feasible.Our propane distribution operations compete with several other propane distributors, primarily onthe basis of service and price, emphasizing reliability of service and responsiveness. Some of ourcompetitors have significantly greater resources. The retail propane industry is mature, and weforesee modest growth in total demand. Given this limited growth, we expect that year-to-yearindustry volumes will be principally affected by weather patterns. Therefore, our ability to growthe propane distribution business is contingent upon continued execution of our community gassystems strategy to capture additional market share, successful penetration of new serviceterritories, and successful utilization ofpricing programs that retain and grow our customer base. Failure to retain and grow our customerbase would have an adverse effect on our results.Xeron competes against various marketers, many of which have significantly greater resources andare able to obtain price or volumetric advantages.BravePoint faces significant competition from a number of larger competitors having substantiallygreater resources available to them to compete on the basis of technological expertise, reputationand price.Changes in technology may adversely affect our advanced information services segments results ofoperations, cash flows and financial condition.BravePoint participates in a market that is characterized by rapidly changing technology andaccelerating product introduction cycles. The success of our advanced information services segmentdepends upon our ability to address the rapidly changing needs of our customers by developing andsupplying high-quality, cost-effective products, product enhancements and services, on a timelybasis, and by keeping pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards. Thereis no assurance that we will be able to keep up with technological advancements necessary to keepour products and services competitive.Our energy marketing subsidiaries have credit risk and credit requirements that may adverselyaffect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.Xeron and PESCO extend credit to counter-parties. While we believe Xeron and PESCO utilize prudentcredit policies, each of these subsidiaries is exposed to the risk that it may not be able tocollect amounts owed to it. If the counter-party to such a transaction fails to perform, and anyunderlying collateral is inadequate, we could experience financial losses.Page 16     Chesapeake Utilities Corporation 2008 Form 10-K  Table of ContentsXeron and PESCO are also dependent upon the availability of credit to buy propane and natural gasfor resale or to trade. If financial market conditions decline generally, or the financialcondition of these subsidiaries or of the Company, declines, then the cost of credit available tothese subsidiaries could increase. If credit is not available, or if credit is more costly, ourresults of operations, cash flows and financial condition may be adversely affected.Our use of derivative instruments may adversely affect our results of operations.Fluctuating commodity prices may affect our earnings and financing costs because our propanedistribution and wholesale marketing segments use derivative instruments, including forwards, swapsand puts, to hedge price risk. In addition, we have utilized in the past, and may decide, afterfurther evaluation, to continue to utilize derivative instruments to hedge price risk for ourDelaware and Maryland natural gas distribution divisions, as well as PESCO. While we have a riskmanagement policy and operating procedures in place to control our exposure to risk, if we purchasederivative instruments that are not properly matched to our exposure, our results of operations,cash flows, and financial conditions may be adversely affected.Changes in customer growth may affect earnings and cash flows.Chesapeakes ability to increase gross margins in its regulated and propane businesses is dependentupon the residential construction market, adding new commercial and industrial customers andconversion of customers to natural gas or propane from other fuel sources. Slowdowns in thesemarkets could adversely affect the Companys gross margin in its regulated or propane businesses,its earnings and cash flows.Chesapeakes businesses are capital intensive, and the costs of capital projects may besignificant.Chesapeakes businesses are capital intensive and require significant investments in internalinfrastructure projects. Our results of operations and financial condition could be adverselyaffected if we are unable to manage such capital projects effectively or if we do not receive fullrecovery of such capital costs in future regulatory proceedings.Chesapeakes facilities and operations could be targets of acts of terrorism.Chesapeakes natural gas distribution, natural gas transmission and propane storage facilities maybe targets of terrorist activities that could result in a disruption of our ability to meetcustomer requirements. Terrorist attacks may also disrupt capital markets and Chesapeakes abilityto raise capital. A terrorist attack on Chesapeakes facilities, or those of its suppliers orcustomers, could result in a significant decrease in revenues or a significant increase in repaircosts, which could adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.The risk of terrorism and political unrest and the current hostilities in the Middle East mayadversely affect the economy and the price and availability of propane, refined fuels and naturalgas.Terrorist attacks, political unrest and the current hostilities in the Middle East may adverselyaffect the price and availability of propane, refined fuels and natural gas, as well as our resultsof operations, our ability to raise capital and our future growth. The impact that the foregoingmay have on our industry in general, and on us in particular, is not known at this time. An act ofterror could result in disruptions of crude oil or natural gas supplies and markets (the sources ofpropane), and our infrastructure facilities could be direct or indirect targets. Terrorist activitymay also hinder our ability to transport propane and natural gas if our means of supplytransportation, such as rail or pipeline, become damaged as a result of an attack. A lower level ofeconomic activity could result in a decline in energy consumption, which could adversely affect ourrevenues or restrict our future growth. Instability in the financial markets as a result ofterrorism could also affect our ability to raise capital. Terrorist activity and hostilities in theMiddle East could likely lead to increased volatility in prices for propane, refined fuels andnatural gas. We maintain insurance policies with insurers in such amounts and with such coverageand deductibles as we believe are reasonable and prudent. There can be no assurance, however, thatsuch insurance will be adequate to protect us from all material expenses related to potentialfuture claims for personal injury and property damage or that such levels of insurance will beavailable in the future at economical prices.Chesapeake Utilities Corporation 2008 Form 10-K     Page 17  Table of ContentsOperational interruptions to our gas transmission and distribution activities, caused by accidents,malfunctions, severe weather (such as a major hurricane), a pandemic or acts of terrorism, couldadversely impact earnings.Inherent in our gas transmission and distribution activities are a variety of hazards andoperational risks, such as leaks, ruptures and mechanical problems. If they are severe enough or ifthey lead to operational interruptions, they could cause substantial financial losses. In addition,these risks could result in loss of human life, significant damage to property, environmentaldamage, impairment of our operations and substantial loss to us. The location of pipeline andstorage facilities near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers,industrial sites and other public gathering places, could increase the level of damages resultingfrom these risks. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our financialposition, results of operations and cash flows.Unionization campaigns could adversely affect our results of operations.The Company may become a target of unionization campaigns. Unions may attempt to pressureChesapeakes employees to choose union representation. Such campaigns could be materiallydisruptive to our business and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.Regulatory and Legal RisksRegulation of the Company, including changes in the regulatory environment, may adversely affectour results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.The Delaware, Maryland and Florida PSCs regulate our natural gas distribution operations in thoseStates; ESNG is regulated by the FERC. These commissions set the rates that we can charge customersfor services subject to their regulatory jurisdiction. Our ability to obtain timely future rateincreases and rate supplements to maintain current rates of return depends on regulatory approvals,and there can be no assurance that our regulated operations will be able to obtain such approvalsor maintain currently authorized rates of return.We are dependent upon construction of new facilities to support future growth in earnings in ournatural gas distribution and interstate pipeline operations.Construction of new facilities required to support future growth is subject to various regulatoryand developmental risks, including but not limited to: (a) our ability to obtain necessaryapprovals and permits by regulatory agencies on a timely basis and on terms that are acceptable tous; (b) potential changes in federal, state and local statutes and regulations, includingenvironmental requirements, that prevent a project from proceeding or increase the anticipated costof the project; (c) inability to acquire rights-of-way or land rights on a timely basis on termsthat are acceptable to us; (d) lack of anticipated future growth in available natural gas supply;and (e) insufficient customer throughput commitments.We are subject to operating and litigation risks that may not be fully covered by insurance.Our operations are subject to the operating hazards and risks normally incidental to handling,storing, transporting and delivering natural gas and propane to end users. As a result, we aresometimes a defendant in legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. We maintaininsurance policies with insurers in such amounts and with such coverages and deductibles as webelieve are reasonable and prudent. There can be no assurance, however, that such insurance will beadequate to protect us from all material expenses related to potential future claims for personalinjury and property damage or that such levels of insurance will be available in the future ateconomical prices.Environmental RisksCosts of compliance with environmental laws may be significant.We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental quality andpollution control. These evolving laws and regulations may require expenditures over a long periodof time to control environmental effects at current and former operating sites, including formermanufactured gas plant sites that we have acquired from third parties. Compliance with these legalobligations requires us to commit capital. If we fail to comply with environmental laws andregulations, even if such failure is caused by factors beyond our control, we may be assessed civilor criminal penalties and fines.Page 18     Chesapeake Utilities Corporation 2008 Form 10-K  Table of ContentsTo date, we have been able to recover, through regulatory rate mechanisms, the costs associatedwith the remediation of former manufactured gas plant sites. However, there is no guarantee that wewill be able to recover future remediation costs in the same manner or at all. A change in ourapproved rate mechanisms for recovery of environmental remediation costs at former manufactured gasplant sites could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.Further, existing environmental laws and regulations may be revised, or new laws and regulationsseeking to protect the environment may be adopted and be applicable to us. Revised or additionallaws and regulations could result in additional operating restrictions on our facilities orincreased compliance costs, which may not be fully recoverable.We may be exposed to certain regulatory and financial risks related to climate change.Climate change is receiving ever increasing attention from scientists and legislators alike. Thedebate is ongoing as to the extent to which our climate is changing, the potential causes of thischange and its potential impacts. Some attribute global warming to increased levels of greenhousegases, including carbon dioxide, which has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts tolimit greenhouse gas emissions.There are a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to address greenhouse gas emissions,which are in various phases of discussion or implementation. The outcome of federal and stateactions to address global climate change could result in a variety of regulatory programs,including potential new regulations, additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities, orother regulatory actions. These actions could:  result in increased costs associated with our operations;  increase other costs to our business;  affect the demand for natural gas and propane; and  impact the prices we charge our customers.Any adoption by federal or state governments mandating a substantial reduction in greenhouse gasemissions could have far-reaching and significant impacts on the energy industry. We cannot predictthe potential impact of such laws or regulations on our future consolidated financial condition,results of operations or cash flows"
