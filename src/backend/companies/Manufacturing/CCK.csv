7,CCK,CROWN HOLDINGS INC,2008-02-28,"ITEM 1A.     RISK FACTORSIn addition to factors discussed  elsewhere in this report and in ManagementsDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, thefollowing are some of the important  factorsthat could  materially and adversely affect the Companys business, financialcondition and results of operations.The substantial indebtedness of the Company could prevent it from fulfillingits obligations.The Company is highly leveraged.  As a result of its substantial  indebtedness,a significant  portion of the  Companys  cash flow will be required to payinterest and principal on its  outstanding  indebtedness and the  Company  may notgenerate  sufficient  cash  flow from  operations,  or have  future  borrowingsavailable  under its credit  facilities,  to enable it to pay its  indebtedness orto fund other liquidity needs.  As of December 31, 2007,  the Company had  approximately$3.4 billion of total  indebtedness  and shareholders  equity of $15 million.The Companys ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 1.6 times for 2007 asdiscussed  in Exhibit 12 to this Annual  Report.  The  Companys  460million of first  priority senior secured notes mature on  September 1,  2011 andits $800 million senior  secured  revolving  credit facilities  mature on May 15,2011.  The Companys $358 million and 281 million senior secured term loanfacilities mature on November 15, 2012.The substantial indebtedness of the Company could:     make it more difficult for the Company to satisfy its obligations;     increase the Companys vulnerability to general adverse economic and industryconditions,  including rising interest rates;     limit the Companys ability to obtain additional financing;     require the  Company to  dedicate a  substantial  portion of its cash flow fromoperations  to service its indebtedness,  thereby reducing the  availability of itscash flow to fund future working capital,  capital expenditures and other generalcorporate requirements;     require the Company to sell assets used in its business;     limit the Companys  flexibility  in planning for, or reacting to, changesin its business and the industry in which it operates; and     place the Company at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitorsthat have less debt.If its financial  condition,  operating  results and liquidity  deteriorate,the Companys  creditors may restrict its ability to obtain  future  financingand its  suppliers  could require  prepayment or cash on delivery  rather than extendcredit to it. If the Companys  creditors  restrict  advances,  the Companysability to  generate  cash flows from  operations  sufficient  to  service  its shortand  long-term  debt obligations  will be further  diminished.  In  addition,  theCompanys  ability to make  payments on and refinance its debt and to fund itsoperations  will depend on the  Companys  ability to generate cash in the future.Some of the Companys indebtedness is subject to floating  interest rates,  which would result in its interest expense  increasing if interest rates rise. As of December 31, 2007,  approximately  $0.9 billion of the Companys $3.4billion of total  indebtedness was subject to floating  interest rates.  Changesin economic  conditions  could result in higher interest rates,  thereby  increasingthe Companys  interest expense and reducing funds available for operations orother  purposes.  The Companys  annual interest  expense was $318 million,$286 million and $361 million for 2007,  2006 and 2005,  respectively.  Based onthe  amount of  variable  rate debt  outstanding  as of December 31, 2007, a 1%increase in variable  interest  rates would increase its annual  interest  expenseby $9 million.  The actual  effect of a 1% increase  could be more than $9 million as the  Companys borrowings  on its  variable  rate  debt are  higherduring  the  year  than at the end of the  year.  In addition,  the cost of theCompanys  securitization  facilities  would also increase with an increase infloating  interest rates.  Accordingly,  the Company may experience  economic lossesand a negative impact on  earnings as a result of interest  rate  fluctuations.Although  the  Company  may use  interest  rate protection  agreements  from timeto time to reduce its  exposure to interest  rate  fluctuations  in somecases,  it may not elect or have the ability to implement  hedges or, if it doesimplement  them, they may not achieve the desired  effect.  See  ManagementsDiscussion  and Analysis of Financial  Condition and Results of OperationsFinancialPositionMarket Risk in this report.-8-Crown Holdings, Inc. Notwithstanding  the  Companys current  indebtedness  levels  andrestrictive  covenants,  the  Company  may  still be able to incur substantialadditional debt, which could exacerbate the risks described above.The Company may be able to incuradditional debt in the future.  Although the Companys credit facilities and theindentures  governing its outstanding notes contain  restrictions on the Companysability to incur indebtedness,  those restrictions are subject to a number of exceptions. In addition,  the Company may consider investments in joint ventures or acquisitions, which may increase the Companys indebtedness. Adding new debt to current debt levelscould intensify the related risks that the Company and its subsidiaries now face. Restrictive covenants in its debtagreements could restrict the Companys operating flexibility. The  Companys  credit facilities  and the  indentures  governing its secured and unsecured  notes  contain affirmative  and negative covenants  that limit the ability of the  Company and its subsidiaries  to take  certain  actions.  These  restrictions  may limit the Companys ability to operate its  businesses  and may  prohibit or limit its ability to enhanceits  operations  or take  advantage of potential business  opportunities as they arise.The credit facilities  require the Company to maintain specified  financial ratios andsatisfy other  financial  conditions.  The credit  facilities  and the  agreements or indentures  governing the Companys  secured and unsecured notes restrict, amongother things and subject to certain exceptions, the ability of the Company to:      incur additional debt;     pay dividends or make other distributions,  repurchase capital stock, repurchasesubordinated debt and make certain investments or loans;     create liens and engage in sale and leaseback transactions;     create restrictions on the payment of dividends and other amounts to the Companyfrom subsidiaries;     change accounting treatment and reporting practices;     enter into agreements  restricting the ability of a subsidiary to pay dividends to,make or repay loans to, transfer property to, or guarantee indebtedness of, the Company orany of its other subsidiaries;     sell or acquire assets and merge or consolidate with or into other companies; and     engage in transactions with affiliates.In addition,  the indentures and agreements  governing the Companys  outstandingunsecured  notes limit, among  other  things,  the  ability of the Company to enterinto  certain  transactions,  such as mergers, consolidations,  asset sales,  saleand leaseback  transactions  and the pledging of assets.  In addition, if the  Companyor certain of its  subsidiaries  experience  specific  kinds of changes of  control,the Companys  credit  facilities  are due and payable and the Company  mustoffer to  repurchase  outstanding notes.The breach of any of these  covenants  by the  Company or the  failure by theCompany to meet any of these ratios  or  conditions  could  result in a defaultunder  any or all of such  indebtedness.  If a default occurs  under  any  suchindebtedness,  all  of  the  outstanding  obligations  thereunder  could  becomeimmediately due and payable,  which could result in a default under the Companysother  outstanding  debt and could lead to an acceleration  of obligations  relatedto other  outstanding  debt. The ability of the Company to comply with the provisionsof the credit  facilities,  the  agreements or indentures  governing other  indebtednessit may incur in the  future  and its  outstanding  secured  and  unsecured  notescan be  affected  by events  beyond its  control  and,  therefore,  it may be unableto meet those  ratios and conditions.-9-Crown Holdings, Inc. The  Company is subjectto certain restrictions  that may limit its ability to make payments out of the cashreserves shown in its consolidated financial statements.The ability of the  Companys  subsidiaries  and joint  ventures  to paydividends,  make  distributions, provide loans or make other  payments to the Companymay be  restricted  by  applicable  state and foreign laws,  potentially  adversetax consequences and their agreements,  including  agreements  governing their debt.In addition,  the equity interests of the Companys joint venture partners or othershareholders in its  non-wholly  owned  subsidiaries  in any dividend or otherdistribution  made by these entities would need to be satisfied on a proportionatebasis with the Company.  As a result, the Company may not be able to access  itscash  flow to  service  its debt,  and the  amount of cash and cash flow  reflectedon its financial statements may not be fully available to the Company.Pending and future  asbestos litigation  and  payments to settle  asbestos-related  claims could  reduce the  Companys cash flow and negatively impact its financial condition. Crown Cork & Seal Company,  Inc.,a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (Crown Cork),  is one of many  defendants in a substantial  number of lawsuits filed  throughout the United States by persons  alleging  bodily injury as a result ofexposure to asbestos.  In 1963,  Crown Cork acquired a subsidiary that had two  operating businesses,  one of which is alleged  to have  manufactured  asbestos-containing insulation  products.  Crown Cork believes that the business ceased manufacturing suchproducts in 1963. The Company  recorded  pre-tax  charges of $29  million,  $10 million,  $10  million,$35 million and $44 million to increase its accrual for  asbestos-related  liabilitiesin 2007,  2006,  2005,  2004 and 2003, respectively.  As of December  31,  2007,Crown  Corks  accrual for pending and future  asbestos-related claims was $201million.   Crown Corks  accrual  includes  estimates for probable costsfor claims through the year 2017. Estimated additional claims costs of $42 millionbeyond 2017 have not been included in the Companysliability, as the Company believes cost projections beyond ten years are inherently unreliable due topotential changes in the litigation environment and other factors whose impact cannot be known orreasonably estimated.  Assumptions  underlying  the accrualinclude that claims for exposure to asbestos that occurred after the sale of thesubsidiarys  insulation  business in 1964 would not be entitled to settlementpayouts and that the Georgia, South Carolina,  Florida,  Ohio,  Mississippi,Texas  and  Pennsylvania  asbestos  legislation  described  under  Note  Mto the  consolidated  financial statements  are expected to have a highly  favorableimpact on Crown  Corks  ability to settle or defend against asbestos-relatedclaims in those states and other states where Pennsylvania law may apply.Crown Cork made cash  payments of $26 million,  $26 million,  $29 million,  $41million and $68 million in 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003,  respectively,  forasbestos-related  claims. These payments have reduced and any such  future  paymentswill  reduce  the cash  flow  available  to  Crown  Cork for its  businessoperations and debt payments.Asbestos-related payments and defense costs may be significantly higher thanthose estimated by Crown Cork because the outcome of this type of litigation (and,therefore, Crown Corks reserve) is subject to a number of assumptions and uncertainties, such as the number or size of asbestos-relatedclaims or settlements, the number of financially viable responsible parties, theextent to which Georgia, South Carolina, Florida, Ohio, Mississippi and Texas statutesrelating to asbestos liability are upheld and/or applied by Georgia, South Carolina, Florida,Ohio, Mississippi and Texas courts, respectively, the extent to which a Pennsylvaniastatute relating to asbestos liability is upheld and/or applied by courts in statesother than Pennsylvania, Crown Corks ability to obtain resolution withoutpayment of asbestos-related claims  by  persons  alleging first exposure to asbestosafter 1964, and the potential impact of any pending or future asbestos-related legislation. Accordingly, Crown Cork may be required to make payments forclaims substantially in excess of its accrual,which could reduce the Companys cash flow and impair its ability to satisfy its obligations.As a result of the uncertainties regarding its asbestos-related liabilities and itsreduced cash flow, the ability of the Company to raise new money in the capital marketsis more difficult and more costly, and the Company may not be able to access thecapital markets in the future.  Further information regarding Crown Corksasbestos-related liabilities is presented within Managements Discussionand Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under theheadings,Provision for Asbestos and Liquidity and Capital Resourcesand under Note M to the consolidated financial statements.-10-Crown Holdings, Inc. The Company has significant pensionplan obligations worldwide and significant  unfunded postretirement obligations, which could reduce its cash flow and negatively impact its financialcondition. The Company  sponsors  various  pension plans  worldwide,  with the largest fundedplans in the U.K., U.S. and Canada.  In 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Companycontributed $65 million,  $90 million,  $401 million, $171 million and $122 million,respectively,  to its pension plans and currently anticipates its 2008  funding to be  approximately  $67 million.  Pension  expense in 2008 is  expected  toincrease  to approximately  $18 million from $10 million in 2007.  A 0.25% changein the expected  rate of return would change 2008 pension  expense by  approximately$12 million.  A 0.25%  change in the discount  rates would change 2008 pension expenseby approximately $9 million.As of December 31, 2007, the Company has a credit balance of $230 million for its U.S.funded plan, arising from past contributions, that can be used to offset future contributions that would otherwise berequired. Based  on  current assumptions,  the Company has no minimum U.S.  pensionfunding  requirement in calendar year 2008 for its funded  plan,  and expects to makepayments of  approximately  $15  million  related to its  supplemental executiveretirement  plan.  While  overfunded as calculated in accordance with U.S.  generally accepted accounting  principles,  the  Companys  U.S.  pension  plan wasunderfunded  on a  termination  basis by approximately  $61 million as of December31, 2007. In addition,  its retiree  medical plans are unfunded. The Companyspension plan assets consist primarily of common stocks and fixed income  securities.If the performance of investments in the plan does not meet the Companys  assumptions,the  underfunding of the pension plan may increase and the Company may have tocontribute  additional  funds to the pension  plan. In addition,  thePension  Protection Act of 2006 could require the Company to accelerate the timingof its  contributions  under its U.S.  pension plan and also  increase the premiumspaid by the Company to the Pension Benefit Guaranty  Corporation.  The actual impactof the Pension  Protection Act on the Companys  U.S.  pension plan fundingrequirements  will depend upon the interest  rates required for determining the plansliabilities and the investment  performance of the plans assets.  An accelerationin the timing of pension  plan  contributions  and an increase in required  premiumscould  decrease  the Companys cash available to pay its  outstanding  obligationsand its net income.  While its U.S.  pension plan continues in effect, the Companycontinues to incur additional pension obligations.The Companys  U.S.  pension plan is subject to the Employee  RetirementIncome  Security Act of 1974, or ERISA. Under ERISA, the Pension Benefit GuarantyCorporation,  or PBGC, has the authority to terminate an underfunded  plan undercertain  circumstances.  In the event its U.S.  pension plan is terminated for anyreason  while the plan is  underfunded,  the Company  will incur a liability to thePBGC that may be equal to  the  entire  amount  of  the  underfunding.  In  addition,as of  December 31,  2007,  the  unfunded accumulated  postretirement  benefit obligation,as calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting  principles,for retiree medical benefits was approximately $483 million, based on assumptionsset forth under Note W to the consolidated financial statements.The Company has had net operatinglosses in the past and may not generate profits in the future. Operating  losses could limit the Companys  ability to service its debt andfund its operations.  For the fiscal  years  ended  December 31,  2005 and 2003,the Company had  consolidated  losses from  continuing operations  of $312  millionand $56  million,  respectively.  The  Company  had income  from  continuing operationsof $528  million,  $342 million and $36 million for the fiscal years ended  December31,  2007, 2006 and 2004, respectively.  However, the Company may not generate netincome in the future.-11-Crown Holdings, Inc. The Companys  principal markets may be subject to overcapacity and intense  competition,  which could reduce theCompanys net sales and net income. Food and beverage cans are standardized  products,  allowingfor relatively little  differentiation  among competitors.  This could lead to overcapacityand price  competition  among food and beverage  producers,  if capacity  growthoutpaced  the  growth in demand for food and  beverage  cans and  overall  manufacturingcapacity exceeded demand.  These market conditions could reduce product prices andcontribute to declining revenue and net income and  increasing  debt  balances.As a result of industry  overcapacityand price  competition,  the Company may not be able to increase  prices sufficientlyto offset  higher costs or to generate  sufficient  cash flow.  The North  Americanfood and beverage can market,  in  particular,  is considered to be a mature market,characterized  by slow growth and a  sophisticated  distribution  system. Competitive pricing pressures,  overcapacity,  the failure to develop new productdesigns and technologies for  products,  as  well  as  other  factors  could  causethe  Company  to  lose  existing  business  or opportunities to generate new businessand could result in decreased cash flow and net income.The Company is subject tocompetition from substitute products, which could result in lower profits and reducedcash flows. The Company is subject to  substantial  competition  from  producers of  alternativepackaging  made from glass, cardboard, and plastic,  particularly from producersof plastic food and beverage containers, whose market has grown over the past several  years.  The Companys  sales depend heavily on thevolumes of sales by the Companys  customers in the food and beverage markets.Changes in preferences for products and  packaging by consumers of  prepackagedfood and beverage cans  significantly  influence the Companys  sales.  Changesin  packaging  by the  Companys  customers  may require the Company to re-toolmanufacturing  operations,  which could  require  material  expenditures.  In addition,a decrease in the costs of, or a further  increase  in consumer  demand for,  alternative packaging  could  result in lower profits and reduced cash flows for the Company.The Company is subject to theeffects of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, which may reduce its net sales andcash flow. The  Company  is  exposed  to  fluctuations  in  foreign  currencies  as  asignificant  portion  of  its consolidated  net sales,  its costs,assets and  liabilities,  are  denominated in currencies other than the U.S.  dollar.For the fiscal years ended  December 31,  2007,  2006 and 2005,  the Companyderived  approximately  73%,  72% and 70%,  respectively,  of its  consolidatednet sales  from  sales in foreign  currencies.  In its  consolidated  financialstatements,  the Company  translates local currency financial  results  into U.S.dollars  based on average  exchange  rates  prevailing  during a  reportingperiod.  During times of a strengthening  U.S.  dollar,  its reported  internationalrevenue and earnings will be  reduced  because  the local  currency  will  translateinto fewer U.S.  dollars.  Conversely,  a weakening  U.S.  dollar will  effectivelyincrease the  dollar-equivalent  of the Companys  expenses and liabilitiesdenominated  in foreign  currencies.  The  Companys  translation  and  exchangeadjustments reduced  reported income before tax by $6 million in 2006 and $94 millionin 2005, and increased  reported income  before  tax by $12  million  in  2007,$98  million  in  2004  and  $207  million  in  2003.  See ManagementsDiscussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results  of  OperationsFinancialPositionMarket  Risk.  Although  the  Company may use  financial  instrumentssuch as foreign  currency forwards from time to time to reduce its exposure to currencyexchange rate  fluctuations  in some cases, it may not elect or have the  ability toimplement  hedges or, if it does  implement  them,  they may not achieve the desired effect.The Companys internationaloperations are subject to various risks that may lead to decreases in its financialresults. The risks  associated  with  operating in foreign  countries  may have a negativeimpact on the Companys liquidity and net income.  The Companys  internationaloperations  generated  approximately 73%, 72% and 70% of its  consolidated  net salesin 2007,  2006 and 2005,  respectively.  The business  strategy of the Company includescontinued expansion of international  activities.  However,  the Companysinternational operations are subject to various risks associated with operating inforeign countries, including:     restrictive trade policies;-12-Crown Holdings, Inc.      inconsistent product regulation or policy changes by foreign agencies or governments;     duties, taxes or government royalties,  including the imposition or increase ofwithholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by non-U.S. subsidiaries;     customs, import/export and other trade compliance regulations;     foreign exchange rate risks;     difficulty in collecting international accounts receivable and potentiallylonger payment cycles;     increased costs in maintaining international manufacturing and marketing efforts;     non-tariff barriers and higher duty rates;     difficulties in enforcement of contractual obligations and intellectualproperty rights;     exchange controls;     national and regional labor strikes;     language and cultural barriers;     high social benefit costs for labor, including costs associated with restructurings;     political, social, legal and economic instability;     taking of property by nationalization or expropriation without fair compensation;     imposition of limitations on  conversions  of foreign  currencies  intodollars or payment of dividends and other payments by non-U.S. subsidiaries;     hyperinflation and currency  devaluation in certain foreign  countries where such currencydevaluation could affect the amount of cash generated by operations in those countries and thereby affect the Companysability to satisfy its obligations; and     war, civil disturbance and acts of terrorism.There can be no guarantee that a deterioration  of economic  conditions in countries in which the Company operates would not have a material impact. The Companys profits willdecline if the price of raw materials or energy rises and it cannot increase the price ofits products. The  Company  uses  various  raw  materials,  such as  aluminum  and steel for  packaging,  in its manufacturing  operations.  Sufficient  quantities  ofthese raw  materials  may not be  available  in the future.  In particular,  steelsuppliers have indicated that a shortage of raw materials to produce steeland  increased  global  demand,  primarily  in China,  have  combined  to createthe need for steel  price increases  to their  customers  and have  resulted  ina  tighter  supply  of steel  which  could  require allocation  among  their  steel purchasing  customers.  Moreover,  the  prices  of  certain  of these rawmaterials,  such  as  aluminum  and  steel,  have  historically  been  subject to  volatility.  In  2007, consumption of steel and aluminum represented  approximately27% and 34%,  respectively,  of the Companys consolidated  cost of products sold,excluding  depreciation and  amortization.  The average market pricefor steel used in packaging  increased  approximately  4% and the average  priceof aluminum  ingot on theLondon  Metal  Exchange  increased  approximately  3% during  2007.  Supplier  consolidationsand  recent government  regulations  provide  additional  uncertainty  as to thelevel of prices at which the  Company might be able to source raw materials in the future.-13-Crown Holdings, Inc. As a result of raw material price increases,  in 2007 the Company  implementedprice increases in most of its steel and aluminum  product  categories.  There canbe no  assurance  that the Company will be able to fully  recover from its customersthe impact of steel  surcharges or steel and aluminum  price  increases. In  addition,if the Company is unable to purchase  steel or aluminum for a  significant  periodof time, the Companys  steel or  aluminum-consuming  operations  would bedisrupted.  The Company is continuing to monitor steel and aluminum prices and theeffect on its operations.The Company may be subject to adverse price  fluctuations  and  surcharges,including  recent steel price increases  discussed above,  when purchasing raw materials.While certain,  but not all, of the Companys contracts pass through raw materialcosts to customers,  the Company may be unable to increase its prices to offsetunexpected  increases  in raw  material  costs  without  suffering  reductions  inunit volume, revenue and  operating  income.  In  addition,  any price  increasesmay take effect  after  related cost increases,  reducing operating income in thenear term. If any of the Companys  principal  suppliers were to  increasetheir  prices  significantly,  impose  substantial  surcharges  or were  unableto meet its requirements for raw materials, either or both of its revenues or profitswould decline.In addition,  the  manufacturing  facilities of the Company are dependent,  invarying  degrees,  upon the availability of water and processed  energy,  such as natural gasand  electricity.  Certain of these energy sources may become difficult or impossibleto obtain on acceptable  terms due to external  factors or may only be availableat  substantially  increased  costs,  which could increase the Companys  costsor interrupt its business.The loss of a major customerand/or customer consolidation could reduce the Companys net sales and profitability. Many of the Companys  largest  customers have acquired  companies with similaror  complementary  product lines.  This  consolidation  has  increased  the  concentrationof the  Companys business with its largest  customers.  In many cases, suchconsolidation has been accompanied by pressure from customers for lower prices,reflecting  the increase in the total volume of product  purchased or the  eliminationof a price differential  between the acquiring  customer and the company acquired.Increased pricing pressures from the Companys customers may reduce the Companysnet sales and net income.The majority of the Companys  sales are to companies  that have leading  marketpositions in the sale of packaged food,  beverages and aerosol products to consumers.Although no one customer  accounted for more than 10% of its net sales in 2007, 2006or 2005, the loss of any of its major  customers,  a reduction in the  purchasinglevels of these  customers or an adverse  change in the terms of supply  agreementswith these  customers  could reduce the Companys net sales and net income.A continued  consolidation  of the Companys customers could exacerbate any such loss.The Companys business isseasonal and weather conditions could reduce the Companys net sales. The Company  manufactures  packaging  primarily  for the food and  beveragecan market.  Its sales can be affected by weather  conditions.  Due  principally tothe seasonal nature of the soft drink,  brewing, iced tea and other beverage  industries,in which demand is stronger  during the summer  months,  sales of the Companysproducts have varied and are expected to vary by quarter. Shipments in the U.S. andEurope are typically  greater in the second and third quarters of the year.  Unseasonablycool weather can reduce consumer demand for certain beverages  packaged in its containers.In addition,  poor weather  conditions that reduce crop yields of packaged foodscan decrease customer demand for its food containers.The  Company is subjectto costs and liabilities related to stringent environmental and health and safetystandards. Laws and  regulations  relating  to  environmental  protection  and health andsafety  may  increase  the Companys  costs of  operating  and reduce itsprofitability.  The  Companys  operations  are subject to numerous  U.S.federal and state and  non-U.S.  laws and  regulations  governing  the  protectionof the environment,  including  those  relating to  treatment,  storage and  disposalof waste,  discharges  into water,  emissions into the atmosphere,  remediationof soil and groundwater  contamination  and protection of  employee  health andsafety.  Future  regulations  may  impose  stricter  environmental  requirementsaffecting the Companys operations. For example,  future restrictionsin some jurisdictions on air emissions of volatile  organic  compounds and the useof certain paint and  lacquering  ingredients may require the Company to employadditional  control equipment or process  modifications.  The Companysoperations and properties, both in the U.S. and abroad, must comply with these lawsand regulations.-14-Crown Holdings, Inc. A number of governmental  authorities both in the U.S. and abroad have enacted,or are considering,  legal requirements  that  would  mandate  certain  rates ofrecycling,  the use of  recycled  materials  and/or limitations  on certain kindsof packaging  materials such as plastics.  In addition,  some companies withpackaging  needs have  responded  to such  developments,  and/or to  perceivedenvironmental  concerns of consumers,  by using  containers made in whole or inpart of recycled  materials.  Such  developments  may reduce the  demand for someof the  Companys  products,  and/or  increase  its costs.  See  ManagementsDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsFinancialPositionEnvironmental Matters.The Company has written down asignificant  amount of goodwill,  and a further writedown of goodwill would result inlower reported net income and a reduction of its net worth. During  2007,  the  Company  recorded a charge of $103  million to writedownthe value of goodwill in its European  metal vacuum closures  business due to adecrease in projected operating results.  Further  impairmentof the  Companys  goodwill  would  require  additional write-offs of goodwill,which would reduce the Companys net income in the period of any such  write-off.At December 31, 2007, the carrying value of the Companys goodwill was approximately$2.2 billion.  Under Statement of Financial Accounting  Standards No. 142,  Goodwilland Other Intangible Assets, the Company is required to evaluate goodwillreflected on its balance sheet at least annually,  or when circumstances indicatea potential  impairment.  If it  determines  that the goodwill is impaired,  theCompany would be required to write-off a portion or all of the goodwill.If the Company  fails to retain key management  and  personnel  the Company may be unable to  implement  its  business  plan. Members of the Companys senior management have extensive industry  experience,and it would be difficult to find new personnel with comparable  experience.  Because the Companys business is highly  specialized, we believe that it would alsobe difficult to replace the Companys key technical  personnel.  The Companybelieves that its future  success  depends,  in large part, on its  experiencedsenior  management  team.  Losing the services of key members of its managementteam could limit the Companys  ability to implement its business plan.A significant  portion of the Companys workforce is unionized and labor  disruptions  could increase the Companys  costs andprevent the Company from supplying its customers. A significant  portion of the Companys  workforce is unionized and a prolongedwork stoppage or strike at any facility with  unionized  employees  could  increaseits costs and prevent the Company from  supplying its  customers.  In addition,upon the  expiration  of existing  collective  bargaining  agreements,  the Companymay not reach new  agreements  without  union  action and any such new  agreementsmay not be on terms satisfactory to the Company.If the Company fails to maintain aneffective system of internal  controls,  the Company may not be able to accurately reportfinancial results or prevent fraud. Effective  internal  controls are  necessary to provide  reliable  financialreports and to assist in the effective  prevention  of fraud.  Any  inability toprovide  reliable  financial  reports or prevent fraud could harm the Companysbusiness.  The Company must annually evaluate its internal procedures to satisfythe  requirements  of  Section  404 of the  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act of 2002,  whichrequires  management  and auditors to assess the  effectiveness  of internal  controls.If the Company  fails to remedy or maintain the adequacy of its internal controls,as such standards are modified,  supplemented or amended from time to time, the Companycould be subject to regulatory  scrutiny,  civil or criminal penalties or shareholderlitigation.-15-Crown Holdings, Inc. In addition,  failure to maintain adequate internal controls could result infinancial  statements that do not  accurately  reflect the Companys  financialcondition.  There can be no assurance  that the Company will be able to completethe work necessary to fully comply with the  requirements  of the  Sarbanes-OxleyAct or that the Companys  management  and external  auditors will continueto conclude that the Companys internal controls are effective.The Company is subject to litigationrisks which could negatively impact its operations and net income. The  Company is subject to various  lawsuits  and claims  with  respect to matterssuch as  governmental, environmental  and employee benefits laws and regulations,securities,  labor, and actions arising out of the normal  course of  business,in addition to  asbestos-related  litigation  described  in Pending and futureasbestos  litigation  and payments to settle  asbestos-related  claims could reducethe  Companys cash  flow  and  negatively  impact  its  financial   condition.The  Company  is  currently  unable  to determine the total expense or  possible  loss,if any,  that may  ultimately  be incurred  in the  resolution  of such legal proceedings.Regardless  of the  ultimate  outcome  of such  legal  proceedings,  they  could  result  insignificant diversion of time by the Companys management.  The results of the Companyspending legal proceedings,  including any  potential  settlements,  are uncertainand the outcome of these  disputes may decrease  its cash  available  for  operationsand  investment,  restrict  its  operations  or  otherwise negatively impact itsbusiness, operating results, financial condition and cash flow"
8,CCK,CROWN HOLDINGS INC,2007-02-28,"ITEM 1A.     RISK FACTORSIn addition to factors  discussed elsewhere in this report and in  Managements  Discussion  and Analysis, thefollowing are some of the  important  factors  that could  materially  and  adversely affect the  Companys  business,  financial  condition  and results of operations. The substantial indebtedness of theCompany could prevent it from fulfilling its obligations.The  Company  is  highly  leveraged. As a  result  of its  substantial  indebtedness,  a significant  portion of the Companyscash flow will be required to pay interest and principal on its outstanding  indebtednessand the Company may not generate  sufficient cash flow from operations,  or have futureborrowings  available under its credit  facilities,  to enable it to pay its indebtedness  or to fund other  liquidity  needs.  As of December 31, 2006,  the Companyhad  approximately  $3.5 billion of total  indebtedness and shareholders  deficitof $545 million.  The Companys  ratio of earnings to fixed charges was 2.1 times for 2006 as discussed in Exhibit 12 to this Annual Report.  The Companys 460 million of first priority  senior secured notes mature on September 1,  2011and its $800 million senior secured  revolving  credit  facilities  mature on May 15, 2011. The Companys $361 million and 284 million senior secured term loanfacilities mature on November 15, 2012. The substantial indebtedness of theCompany could:      make it more difficult for the Company to satisfy its obligations;     increase the Companys vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions,including rising interest rates;     limit the Companys ability to obtain additional financing;     require the  Company to  dedicate a  substantial  portion of its cash flow from  operations  to service its  indebtedness,  thereby reducing the  availability of its cash flow to fund future working capital,  capital    expenditures and other general corporate requirements;     require the Company to sell assets used in its business;     limit the Companys  flexibility  in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its businessand the industry in which it operates; and     place the Company at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitorsthat have less debt.If its financial  condition, operating results and liquidity  deteriorate,  the Companys creditors may restrictits ability to obtain future  financing and its  suppliers  could  require  prepayment orcash on delivery  rather than extend credit to it. If the Companys creditors  restrict advances,  the  Companys  ability to  generate  cash flows from  operations sufficient  to service its short and long-term debt obligations will be further diminished.  In addition,  the Companys ability to make payments on and refinanceits debt and to fund its operations will depend on the Companys ability to generatecash in the future. Some of the Companys indebtedness is subject to floating  interest rates,  which would result in its interest expense  increasing if interest rates rise. As of December 31, 2006,approximately $1.1 billion of the Companys $3.5 billion of total indebtednesswas subject to floating interest rates. Changes in economic conditions could result inhigher interest rates, thereby increasing the Companys interest expense andreducing funds available  for operations or other purposes.  The Companys annualinterest  expense was $286 million,  $361 million and $361 million for 2006, 2005 and2004,  respectively.  Based on the amount of variable rate debt  outstanding  as ofDecember 31, 2006, a 1% increase in variable  interest rates would increase its annualinterest expense by $11 million.  Accordingly,  the Company may experience  economiclosses and a negative impact on earnings as a result of interest rate  fluctuations. Although the Company may use interest rate protection  agreements from time to time toreduce its exposure to interest  rate  fluctuations  in some cases,  it may not elect orhave the ability to  implement  hedges or, if it does implement them, they may notachieve the desired effect. See Managements  Discussion and Analysis ofFinancial  Condition and Results of OperationsFinancial PositionMarket Risk inthis report. -8-Crown Holdings, Inc. Notwithstanding  the  Companys current  indebtedness  levels  and  restrictive  covenants,  the  Company  may  still beable to incur substantial additional debt, which could exacerbate the risks describedabove. The Company may be able to incuradditional debt in the future.  Although the Companys credit facilities and theindentures  governing its outstanding notes contain  restrictions on the Companysability to incur indebtedness,  those restrictions are subject to a number of exceptions. In addition,  the Company may consider investments in joint ventures or acquisitions, which may increase the Companys indebtedness. Adding new debt to current debt levelscould intensify the related risks that the Company and its subsidiaries now face. Restrictive covenants in its debtagreements could restrict the Companys operating flexibility. The  Companys  credit facilities  and the  indentures  governing its secured and unsecured  notes  contain affirmative  and negative covenants  that limit the ability of the  Company and its subsidiaries  to take  certain  actions.  These  restrictions  may limit the Companys ability to operate its  businesses  and may  prohibit or limit its ability to enhanceits  operations  or take  advantage of potential business  opportunities as they arise.The credit facilities  require the Company to maintain specified  financial ratios andsatisfy other  financial  conditions.  The credit  facilities  and the  agreements or indentures  governing the Companys  secured and unsecured notes restrict, amongother things and subject to certain exceptions, the ability of the Company to:      incur additional debt;     pay dividends or make other distributions,  repurchase capital stock, repurchasesubordinated debt and make certain investments or loans;     create liens and engage in sale and leaseback transactions;     create restrictions on the payment of dividends and other amounts to the Company from subsidiaries;     change accounting treatment and reporting practices;     enter into agreements  restricting the ability of a subsidiary to pay dividends to,make or repay loans to, transfer property to, or guarantee indebtedness of, the Company orany of its other subsidiaries;     sell or acquire assets and merge or consolidate with or into other companies; and     engage in transactions with affiliates.In addition,  the indentures andagreements governing the Companys  outstanding unsecured notes limit, among otherthings, the ability of the Company to enter into certain transactions,  such as mergers, consolidations,  asset sales, sale and leaseback transactions and the pledging ofassets.  In addition,  if the Company or certain of its subsidiaries  experience specific kinds of changes of control, the Companys credit facilities are due andpayable and the Company must offer to repurchase outstanding notes. The breach of any of these covenants  by the  Company or the failure by the Company to meet any of these  ratios or conditions  could result in a default under any or all of such  indebtedness.  If adefault occurs under any such  indebtedness,  all of the  outstanding obligations thereunder  could  become  immediately  due and  payable,  which  could  result in adefault  under  the  Companys  other outstanding  debt and could lead to anacceleration  of obligations  related to other  outstanding  debt. The ability of theCompany to comply with the  provisions of the credit  facilities,  the  agreements  orindentures  governing  other  indebtedness  it may incur in the future and its outstanding  secured and  unsecured  notes can be affected by events beyond its controland,  therefore,  it may be unable to meet those ratios and conditions. -9-Crown Holdings, Inc. The  Company is subject to certain restrictions  that may limit its ability to make  payments  out of the cash  reserves shown in its consolidated financial statements. The ability of the  Companys subsidiaries  and joint  ventures to pay  dividends,  make  distributions,  provide loans or make other payments to the Company may be  restricted  by  applicable  stateand foreign  laws,  potentially  adverse tax  consequences  and their agreements, including  agreements  governing their debt. In addition,  the equity interests of theCompanys joint venture partners or other  shareholders in its non-wholly owned subsidiaries in any dividend or other distribution made by these entities would need tobe satisfied on a proportionate  basis with the Company.  As a result,  the Company maynot be able to access its cash flow to service its debt, and the amount of cash and cashflow reflected on its financial statements may not be fully available to the Company. Pending and future  asbestos litigation  and  payments to settle  asbestos-related  claims could  reduce the  Companys cash flow and negatively impact its financial condition. Crown Cork & Seal Company,  Inc.,a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (Crown Cork),  is one of many  defendants in a substantial  number of lawsuits filed  throughout the United States by persons  alleging  bodily injury as a result ofexposure to asbestos.  In 1963,  Crown Cork acquired a subsidiary that had two  operating businesses,  one of which is alleged  to have  manufactured  asbestos-containing insulation  products.  Crown Cork believes that the business ceased manufacturing suchproducts in 1963. The Company recorded  pre-taxcharges of $10 million,  $10 million,  $35 million,  $44 million and $30 million toincrease its accrual for asbestos-related  liabilities in 2006, 2005, 2004, 2003 and2002,  respectively.  As of December 31, 2006, Crown Corks accrual for pending andfuture  asbestos-related  claims was $198  million and Crown Cork  estimates  that itsrange of  potential  liability  for pending and future  asbestos  claims that areprobable and estimable is between $198 million and $247  million.  Crown Corksaccrual includes  estimates for probable  costs for claims  through the year 2016.  Theupper end of Crown Corks  estimated  range of possible asbestos  costs of $247 million  includes  claims  beyond that date.  Assumptions  underlying  the accrual andthe range of potential liability  include that claims for exposure to asbestos thatoccurred after the sale of the  subsidiarys insulation business in 1964 would notbe entitled to settlement payouts and that the South Carolina,  Florida, Ohio, Mississippi, Texas and Pennsylvania asbestos legislation described underNote M to the consolidated  financial  statements are expected tohave a highly favorable impact on Crown Corks ability to settle or defend against asbestos-related  claims in those states and other states where Pennsylvania lawmay apply. Crown Cork made cash payments of$26 million,  $29 million,  $41 million,  $68 million and $114 million in 2006,  2005,2004, 2003 and 2002,  respectively,  for  asbestos-related  claims. These payments havereduced and any such future payments will reduce the cash flow available to Crown Corkfor its business operations and debt payments. Asbestos-related pay-outs anddefense costs may be significantly higher than those estimated by Crown Cork because theoutcome of this type of litigation (and, therefore, Crown Corks reserve and rangeof potential liabilities) is subject to a number of assumptions and uncertainties, suchas the number or size of asbestos-related claims or settlements, the number offinancially viable responsible parties, the extent to which South Carolina,Florida, Ohio, Mississippi and Texas statutes relating to asbestos liability are upheld and/orapplied by South Carolina, Florida, Ohio, Mississippi and Texas courts, respectively, theextent to which a Pennsylvania statute relating to asbestos liability is upheld and/orapplied by courts in states other than Pennsylvania, Crown Corks ability to obtainresolution without payment of asbestos-related claims  by  persons  alleging firstexposure to asbestos after 1964, and the potential impact of any pending or futureasbestos-related legislation, including potential U.S. federal legislation described inthe Companys consolidated financial statements.  Accordingly,  Crown Cork may berequired to make  payments  for claims  substantially  in excess of its accrual and rangeof  potential liability,  which  could  reduce the  Companys  cash flow and  impairits  ability  to  satisfy  its  obligations.  As a result of the uncertainties  regardingits  asbestos-related  liabilities and its reduced cash flow, the ability of the Companyto raise new money in the capital  markets is more  difficult and more costly,  and theCompany may not be able to access the capital  markets in the future. Further informationregarding Crown Corks  asbestos-related  liabilities is presented within Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial  Condition and Results of Operations underthe headings,  Provision for Asbestos and Liquidityand Capital Resources and under Note M to the consolidatedfinancial statements. -10-Crown Holdings, Inc. The Company has significant pensionplan obligations worldwide and significant  unfunded U.S. postretirement obligations, which could reduce its cash flow and negatively impact its financialcondition. The Company  sponsors  various pension plans  worldwide,  with the largest funded plans in the U.K., U.S. and Canada. In 2006,  2005, 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company contributed $90 million, $401million,  $171 million,  $122 million and $144 million,  respectively, to its pensionplans and currently  anticipates its 2007 funding to be approximately  $62 million.  Pensionexpense in 2007 is expected to decrease to  approximately  $14 million from $37 millionin 2006,  primarily due to higher plan assets. A 0.25% change in the expected rate ofreturn would change 2007  pension  expense by  approximately  $12 million.  A 0.25%change in the discount  rates would change 2007 pension  expense byapproximately $8 million. The Company has  significant current  funding  obligations  for pension  benefits.  Based on current  assumptions, the Company has no minimum U.S.  pension  funding  requirement  in calendar year 2007for its funded plan,  but expects to make payments of  approximately $9 million related to itssupplemental  executive  retirement plan. While overfunded as calculated in accordance withU.S. generally accepted accounting principles, the Companys U.S. pension plan was underfunded on atermination basis by approximately $134 million as of December 31, 2006. In addition, its retireemedical plans are unfunded.  The  Companys  pension  planassets  consist  primarily  of common  stocks and fixed  income securities.  If the performance of investments in the plan does not meet the Companys  assumptions, the  underfunding of the pension plan may increase and the Company may have to contribute  additional  funds to the pension  plan.  In addition,  the recently  enactedPension  Protection Act of 2006 could require the Company to accelerate  the timing ofits  contributions  under its U.S.  pension plan and also  increase the premiums  paid bythe Company to the Pension  Benefit  Guaranty  Corporation.  The actual  impact of thePension Protection Act on the Companys U.S.  pension plan funding  requirements will depend upon the interest rates required for  determining the  plans liabilities  and the  investment  performance  of the  plans  assets.  An acceleration  in the  timing of  pension  plan contributions and an increase in required premiums could decrease the Companys cash available to pay its outstanding obligations and its net income. While its U.S. pension plan continues in effect, theCompany continues to incur additional pension obligations. The Companys U.S. pension planis subject to the Employee  Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, or ERISA.  UnderERISA, the Pension Benefit Guaranty  Corporation,  or PBGC, has the authority toterminate an underfunded plan under certain  circumstances.  In the event its U.S. pension plan is terminated for any reason while the plan is underfunded,  the Companywill incur a liability to the PBGC that may  be  equal  to  the  entire  amount  of the underfunding.  In  addition,  as of  December 31,  2006,  the  unfunded  accumulatedpostretirement  benefit  obligation,  as calculated in accordance  with U.S. generally accepted  accounting  principles,  for retiree medical benefits was approximately $614million, based on assumptions set forth under Note W to theconsolidated financial statements. The Company could be liable forConstars  pension  obligations,  which could  decrease cash available to satisfyits  obligations  and fund operations. Under  certain  circumstances,  theCompany may be liable for the pension  obligations  of Constar  International  Inc.,  theCompanys former  subsidiary  that engaged in an initial  public  offering in 2002, which could decrease the Companys cash available to pay its outstanding obligations.  At the time of the Constar initial public  offering,  Constar assumed sponsorship of the Companys  pension plan which covered all active and formerhourly employees and certain former salaried  employees of Constar.  Such plan wasunderfunded by approximately  $24 million when it was assumed by Constar.  The Constarpension plan is subject to ERISA.  Under ERISA, the PBGC has the authority to terminatean  underfunded  plan under certain  circumstances.  If the Constar  pension plan isterminated  within five years of the completion of the Constar initial public  offering, the PBGC may bring a claim under ERISA to hold the Company liable for the Constar pension plan  underfunding  if it is determined  that a principal  purpose of theConstar  initial public  offering was to evade pension  liability.  The Company does notbelieve that is the case.  The actual amount for which the Company may become liable inthe future  depends on the future  funding  status of the  Constar  pension  plan.  Inany case,  if this claim is brought  against the Company in the future, it may be costlyto defend and the claim may reduce the Companys liquidity. -11-Crown Holdings, Inc. The Company has had net operatinglosses in the past and may not generate profits in the future. Operating  losses  could  limit the Companys  ability  to  service  its debt and fund its  operations.  For the fiscal  years  ended December 31,  2005, 2003 and 2002, the Company had consolidatedlosses from continuing  operations before cumulative effect of a change in accounting of$320 million, $58 million and $235 million,  respectively.  The Company had income fromcontinuing  operations of $342 million and $27 million for the fiscal years ended December 31,  2006 and 2004,  respectively.  However,  the Company may not generate netincome in the future. The Companys  principal markets are subject to overcapacity and intense  competition,  which could reduce theCompanys net sales and net income. The worldwide  food and beverage canmarkets have  experienced  limited  growth in demand in recent  years.  Food and beveragecans are standardized  products,  allowing for relatively  little  differentiation  among competitors.  This has led to overcapacity  and price competition  among food and beverage  producers,  as capacity  growth  outpaced  the growth in demand for food and beverage  cans and overall  manufacturing  capacity  exceeded  demand.  These market conditions  reduced product prices,  which  contributed to declining revenue and netincome and  increasing  debt balances that the Company  experienced  in the past. As aresult of industry  overcapacity and price  competition,  the Company may not be able toincrease prices  sufficiently to offset higher costs or to generate  sufficient cashflow. The North American food and beverage can market, in particular,  is considered tobe a mature market,  characterized by slow growth and a  sophisticated  distribution system.  Price-driven  competition  has  increased as  producers  seek to capture moresales volumes in order to keep their plants operating at optimal levels and reduce unitcosts. Competitive  pricing  pressures, overcapacity,  the failure to develop new product designs and technologies  forproducts,  as well as other  factors  could cause the Company to lose  existing  businessor  opportunities  to generate  new  business  and could  result in decreased cash flowand net income. The Company is subject tocompetition from substitute products, which could result in lower profits and reducedcash flows. The Company is subject tosubstantial  competition  from producers of alternative  packaging made from glass, cardboard,  and plastic, particularly  from  producers of plastic  food and beverage containers,  whose  market has grown  substantially  over the past several years.  The Companys  sales depend  heavily on the volumes of sales by the  Companys customers  in the food and  beverage  markets. Changes in  preferences  for products and packaging by consumers of  prepackaged  food and beverage cans  significantly  influencethe Companys sales.  Changes in packaging by the Companys customers mayrequire the Company to re-tool  manufacturing  operations,  which could  require material  expenditures.  In  addition,  a decrease  in the costs of, or a further increase  in  consumer  demand  for, alternative packaging could result in lower profitsand reduced cash flows for the Company. The Company is subject to theeffects of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, which may reduce its net sales andcash flow. The Company is exposed tofluctuations in foreign currencies as a significant portion of its consolidated netsales, and some of its costs, assets and liabilities, are denominated in currencies otherthan the U.S. dollar. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, theCompany derived approximately 72%, 70% and 69%, respectively, of its consolidated netsales from sales in foreign currencies. In its consolidated financial statements, theCompany translates local currency financial results into U.S. dollars based on averageexchange rates prevailing during a reporting period. -12-Crown Holdings, Inc. During times of a  strengthening U.S.  dollar,  its reported  international  revenue and  earnings  will be reduced because the local currency will translate into fewer U.S. dollars.  Conversely,  aweakening U.S. dollar will effectively increase the  dollar-equivalent of the Companys expenses and  liabilities  denominated in foreign  currencies.  The Companys translation  and exchange  adjustments reduced  reported  income  before tax by $6million in 2006, $94 million in 2005 and $26 million in 2002,  and  increased  reportedincome before tax by $98 million  in 2004  and $207  million in 2003.  See  Managements Discussion  and  Analysis  of  Financial  Condition  and  Results of OperationsFinancial PositionMarket  Risk. Although the Company may use financial instrumentssuch as foreign currency forwards from time to time to reduce its  exposure to currency exchange  rate  fluctuations  in some cases,  it may not elect or have the ability toimplement hedges or, if it does implement them, they may not achieve the desired effect. The Companys internationaloperations are subject to various risks that may lead to decreases in its financialresults. The risks  associated  withoperating in foreign  countries may have a negative impact on the Companys liquidity and net income.  The Companys  international  operations generated approximately 72%, 70% and 69% of its consolidated net sales in 2006, 2005 and 2004,respectively.  The business strategy of the Company includes continued expansion ofinternational  activities.  However,  the Companys international operations are subjectto various risks associated with operating in foreign countries, including:      restrictive trade policies;     inconsistent product regulation or policy changes by foreign agencies or governments;     duties, taxes or government royalties,  including the imposition or increase ofwithholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by non-U.S. subsidiaries;     customs, import/export and other trade compliance regulations;     foreign exchange rate risks;     difficulty in collecting international accounts receivable and potentiallylonger payment cycles;     increased costs in maintaining international manufacturing and marketing efforts;     non-tariff barriers and higher duty rates;     difficulties in enforcement of contractual obligations and intellectualproperty rights;     exchange controls;     national and regional labor strikes;     language and cultural barriers;     high social benefit costs for labor, including costs associated with restructurings;     political, social, legal and economic instability;     taking of property by nationalization or expropriation without fair compensation;     imposition of limitations on  conversions  of foreign  currencies  intodollars or payment of dividends and other payments by non-U.S. subsidiaries;     hyperinflation and currency  devaluation in certain foreign  countries where such currencydevaluation could affect the amount of cash generated by operations in those countries and thereby affect the Companysability to satisfy its obligations; and     war, civil disturbance and acts of terrorism.There can be no guarantee that a deterioration  of economic  conditions in countries in which the Company operates would not have a material impact. -13-Crown Holdings, Inc. The Companys profits willdecline if the price of raw materials or energy rises and it cannot increase the price ofits products. The Company uses various rawmaterials,  such as aluminum and steel for metals packaging, in its manufacturing operations.  Sufficient quantities of these raw materials may not be available in thefuture.  Moreover, the prices of certain of these raw materials,  such as aluminum  and steel,  have  historically  been  subject  to  volatility.  In 2006,  consumption  of steel  and  aluminum  represented approximately  29%  and  31%,  respectively,  of  the Companys  consolidated  cost  of  products  sold,  excluding  depreciation  andamortization.  The average  market  price for steel used in packaging  increased approximately  6% and the average  price of aluminum ingot on the London Metal Exchangeincreased  approximately 35% during 2006. Supplier  consolidations and recent governmentregulations provide additional uncertainty as to the level of prices at which the Companymight be able to source raw materials in the future. As a result of price increases,  in2006 the Company  implemented  significant price increases in most of its steel andaluminum product categories.  There  can be no  assurance  that the  Company  will beable to fully  recover  from its  customers  the  impact  of steel surcharges  or steeland  aluminum  price  increases.  In  addition,  if the  Company is unable to  purchase steel or  aluminum  for a significant  period of time, the Companys  steel or aluminum-consuming  operations  would be disrupted.  The Company is continuing tomonitor steel and aluminum prices and the effect on its operations. The Company may be subject toadverse price fluctuations and surcharges,  including recent steel price increases discussed above, when purchasing raw  materials.  While certain,  but not all, of theCompanys  contracts pass through raw material costs to customers,  the Company maybe unable to increase its prices to offset  unexpected  increases in raw material  costs without  suffering  reductions in unit volume,  revenue and operating  income.  Inaddition,  any price increases may take effect after related cost increases,  reducingoperating  income in the near term. If any of the Companys  principal  supplierswere to increase their prices  significantly,  impose substantial  surcharges  or wereunable to meet its  requirements  for raw  materials,  either or both of its revenues orprofits would decline. In addition,  the  manufacturing facilities of the Company are  dependent,  in varying  degrees,  upon the  availability of processed energy,  such as natural  gas and  electricity.  Certain of these  energy sources  may become  difficult  or  impossible  to obtain on acceptable  terms due to external  factors or may only be  available  at  substantially  increased  costs,  whichcould  increase  the Companys costs or interrupt its business. The loss of a major customer and/orcustomer consolidation could reduce the Companys net sales and profitability. Many of the Companys largest customers have acquired  companies with similar or complementary  product lines. This consolidation has increased  the  concentration  of the  Companys  business  withits largest  customers.  In many cases,  such  consolidation  has been accompanied  bypressure  from  customers  for lower prices,  reflecting  the increase in the totalvolume of product  purchased or the elimination of a price  differential  between theacquiring  customer and the company  acquired.  Increased  pricing pressures from theCompanys customers may reduce the Companys net sales and net income. The majority of the  Companys sales are to companies  that have leading  market  positions in the sale of packaged food,  beverages and aerosol  products to  consumers.  Although noone customer  accounted for more than 10% of its net sales in 2006, 2005, or 2004, theloss of any of its major  customers,  a reduction in the purchasing  levels of these customers or an adverse change in the terms of supply  agreements with these customerscould reduce the Companys net sales and net income. A continued  consolidation ofthe Companys customers could exacerbate any such loss. The Companys business isseasonal and weather conditions could reduce the Companys net sales. The  Company  manufactures packaging  primarily  for the  food  and  beverage  can  market.  Its  sales  can be affected  by  weather conditions. Due  principally to the seasonal nature of the softdrink, brewing, iced tea and other beverage industries, in which demand is stronger during the summer months,  sales of the Companys  products have varied and areexpected to vary by quarter.  Shipments in the U.S. and Europe are typically  greater inthe second and third quarters of the year.  Unseasonably cool weather can reduce consumerdemand for certain  beverages  packaged in its  containers.  In addition,  poor weather conditions that reduce crop yields of packaged foods can decrease customer demand forits food containers. -14-Crown Holdings, Inc. The  Company is subject to costs andliabilities related to stringent environmental and health and safety standards. Laws and  regulations  relating to environmental  protection  and health and safety may increase the Companys  costsof operating and reduce its  profitability.  The Companys  operations are subjectto numerous U.S. federal and state and non-U.S.  laws and regulations governing theprotection of the  environment,  including  those relating to treatment,  storage anddisposal of waste,  discharges into water, emissions into the atmosphere,  remediation ofsoil and groundwater  contamination and protection of employee health and safety. Futureregulations may impose stricter environmental requirements affecting the Companysoperations.  For example,  anticipated future restrictions  in some  jurisdictions  onair  emissions  of volatile  organic  compounds  and the use of certain  paint and lacquering ingredients may require the Company to employ  additional  control  equipmentor process  modifications.  The Companys  operations and properties, both in theU.S. and abroad, must comply with these laws and regulations. A number of governmental authorities  both in the U.S. and abroad have enacted,  or are  considering,  legal requirements  that would mandate certain rates of recycling,  the use of recycledmaterials and/or  limitations on certain kinds of packaging  materials such as plastics. In addition,  some companies with packaging  needs have responded to such  developments, and/or to perceived  environmental concerns of consumers,  by using  containers made inwhole or in part of recycled  materials.  Such  developments may reduce the demand forsome of the Companys  products,  and/or increase its costs. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial  Condition and Results  of  Operations - Financial Position - Environmental  Matters. The Company has written down asignificant  amount of goodwill,  and a further writedown of goodwill would result inlower reported net income and a reduction of its net worth. Further  impairment of the Companys goodwill would require additional  write-offs of goodwill,  which would reduce theCompanys net income in the period of any such write-off.  At December 31, 2006, the carrying  value of the Companys  goodwill was  approximately  $2.2 billion. Under  Statement of Financial  Accounting  Standards  No. 142,  Goodwill  andOther  Intangible Assets, the Company is required to evaluate  goodwill  reflectedon its balance sheet at least  annually, or when  circumstances  indicate a potential impairment.  If it determines that the goodwill is impaired, the Company  would berequired to  write-off a portion or all of the  goodwill.  The Company  adopted thisstandard  on  January 1,  2002 and  recorded  a  noncash,  non-tax  deductible impairment  charge of $1.0 billion, reported as the cumulative effect of a change inaccounting. If the Company  fails to retain key management  and  personnel  the Company may be unable to  implement  its  business  plan. Members of the Companys senior management have extensive  industry  experience,  and it would be difficult to find newpersonnel with comparable  experience.  Because the Companys  business is highly specialized,  we believe that it would also be difficult to replace the Companyskey technical  personnel.  The Company believes that its future success depends, in largepart, on its experienced senior management  team.  Losing the  services of key  membersof its  management  team could limit the  Companys  ability to  implement  itsbusiness plan. A significant  portion of the Companys workforce is unionized and labor  disruptions  could increase the Companys  costs andprevent the Company from supplying its customers. A  significant  portion of the Companys  workforce  is  unionized and a prolonged work stoppage or strikeat any facility with unionized  employees could increase its costs and prevent theCompany from supplying its customers.  In addition,  upon the expiration of existingcollective bargaining  agreements, the Company may not reach new  agreements  withoutunion action and any such new  agreements  may not be on terms  satisfactory  to theCompany. -15-Crown Holdings, Inc. If the Company fails to maintain aneffective system of internal  controls,  the Company may not be able to accurately reportfinancial results or prevent fraud. Effective  internal controls arenecessary to provide reliable  financial  reports and to assist in the effective prevention of fraud. Any inability to provide  reliable  financial  reports or preventfraud could harm the  Companys  business.  The Company must annually evaluate itsinternal  procedures to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of2002, which requires  management and  auditors  to assess the  effectiveness  of internal controls.  If the Company  fails to remedy or  maintain  the  adequacy of its internal controls,  as such  standards  are  modified,  supplemented  or amended  from time totime,  the Company  could be subject to regulatory scrutiny, civil or criminal penaltiesor shareholder litigation. In addition,  failure to maintainadequate internal  controls could result in financial  statements that do not accurately reflect the Companys  financial  condition.  There can be no assurance  that the Companywill be able to complete the work necessary to fully comply with the  requirements  ofthe  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act or that the  Companys  management  and external auditors willcontinue to conclude that the Companys internal controls are effective. The Company is subject to litigationrisks which could negatively impact its operations and net income. The  Company is subject to various lawsuits  and claims with  respect to matters  such as  governmental,  environmental and  employee benefits laws and regulations,  securities,  labor, and actions arising outof the normal course ofbusiness,  in addition to  asbestos-related  litigation  described in Pending andfuture asbestos  litigation and  payments to settle  asbestos-related  claims couldreduce  the Companys cash flow and  negatively  impact its  financialcondition.  The Company is currently  unable to determine the total expense orpossible  loss, if any, that may ultimately be incurred in the  resolution  of such legal proceedings.  Regardless  of the ultimate  outcome of such legal  proceedings,  theycould result in significant  diversion of time by the Companys  management.  Theresults of the Companys  pending  legal  proceedings,  including any potential settlements,  are uncertain and the outcome of these disputes may decrease its cashavailable for operations and investment, restrict its operations or otherwise negativelyimpact its business, operating results, financial condition and cash flow"
11,CCK,CROWN HOLDINGS INC,2006-03-16,"ITEM 1A.     RISK FACTORSIn addition to factors  discussed elsewhere in this report and in  Managements  Discussion  and Analysis, thefollowing are some of the  important  factors  that could  materially  and  adversely affect the Companys business, financial condition and results of operations.The substantial indebtedness of theCompany could prevent it from fulfilling its obligations.The Company is highly leveraged.  Asa result of its substantial  indebtedness,  a significant  portion of the Companyscash flow will be required to pay interest and principal on its outstanding  indebtedness and the Company may not generate  sufficient cash flow from operations,  or have future borrowings  available under its credit  facilities,  to enable it to pay itsindebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs. As of December 31, 2005, the Company hadapproximately  $3.4 billion of total  indebtedness and shareholders  deficit of$236  million.  The  Companys  earnings  did not cover fixed  charges by $306 million for 2005 as  discussed in Exhibit 12 to this Annual  Report.  The Companys$544 million of first priority  senior  secured notes mature on  September 1,  2011 andits $800 million senior  secured  revolving  credit  facilities  mature on May 15,  2011. The Companys  $165 and 287 million senior secured term loan facilitiesmature on November 15, 2012. The substantial indebtedness of theCompany could:      make it more difficult for the Company to satisfy its obligations;     increase the Companys vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions,including rising interest rates;     limit the Companys ability to obtain additional financing;     require the  Company to  dedicate a  substantial  portion of its cash flow from  operations  to service its  indebtedness,  thereby reducing the  availability of its cash flow to fund future working capital,  capital    expenditures and other general corporate requirements;     require the Company to sell assets used in its business;     limit the Companys  flexibility  in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its businessand the industry in which it operates; and     place the Company at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitorsthat have less debt.-8-Crown Holdings, Inc. If its financial  condition, operating results and liquidity  deteriorate,  the Companys creditors may restrictits ability to obtain future  financing and its  suppliers  could  require  prepayment orcash on delivery  rather than extend credit to it. If the Companys creditors  restrict advances,  the  Companys  ability to  generate  cash flows from  operations sufficient  to service its short and long-term debt obligations will be further diminished.  In addition,  the Companys ability to make payments on and refinanceits debt and to fund its operations will depend on the Companys ability to generatecash in the future. Some of the Companys indebtedness is subject to floating  interest rates,  which would result in its interest expense  increasing if interest rates rise. As of December 31,  2005, approximately  $0.9 billion of the  Companys  $3.4  billion of total  indebtedness was subject to floating interest  rates.  Changes in economic  conditions  could resultin higher  interest rates,  thereby  increasing the Companys  interest expense andreducing funds available for operations or other purposes.  The Companys  annualinterest  expense was $361 million,  $361 million and $379 million for 2005, 2004 and2003,  respectively.  Based on the amount of variable rate debt  outstanding as ofDecember 31, 2005, a 1% increase in variable interest rates would increase its annualinterest expense by $9 million.  Accordingly,  the Company may experience  economiclosses and a negative impact on earnings as a result of interest rate  fluctuations. Although the Company may use interest rate protection  agreements  from time to time toreduce its exposure to interest rate  fluctuations in some cases, it may not elect orhave the  ability to  implement  hedges or, if it does  implement  them,  they may notachieve  the  desired  effect.  See Managements Discussion and Analysis ofFinancial Condition and Results of OperationsFinancial  PositionMarket Risk inthis report. Notwithstanding  the  Companys current  indebtedness  levels  and  restrictive  covenants,  the  Company  may  still beable to incur substantial additional debt, which could exacerbate the risks describedabove. The Company may be able to incuradditional debt in the future.  Although the Companys credit facilities and theindentures  governing its outstanding notes contain  restrictions on the Companysability to incur indebtedness,  those restrictions are subject to a number of exceptions. In addition,  the Company may consider investments in joint ventures or acquisitions, which may increase the Companys indebtedness. Adding new debt to current levels couldintensify the related risks that the Company and its subsidiaries now face. Restrictive covenants in its debtagreements could restrict the Companys operating flexibility. The  Companys  credit facilities  and the  indentures  governing its secured and unsecured  notes  contain affirmative  and negative covenants  that limit the ability of the  Company and its subsidiaries  to take  certain  actions.  These  restrictions  may limit the Companys ability to operate its  businesses  and may  prohibit or limit its ability to enhanceits  operations  or take  advantage of potential business  opportunities as they arise.The credit facilities  require the Company to maintain specified  financial ratios andsatisfy other  financial  conditions.  The credit  facilities  and the  agreements or indentures  governing the Companys  secured and unsecured notes restrict, among otherthings and subject to certain exceptions, the ability of the Company to:      incur additional debt;     pay dividends or make other distributions,  repurchase capital stock, repurchasesubordinated debt and make certain investments or loans;     create liens and engage in sale and leaseback transactions;     create restrictions on the payment of dividends and other amounts to the Company from subsidiaries;     change accounting treatment and reporting practices;-9-Crown Holdings, Inc.      enter into agreements  restricting the ability of a subsidiary to pay dividends to,make or repay loans to, transfer property to, or guarantee indebtedness of, the Company orany of its other subsidiaries;     sell or acquire assets and merge or consolidate with or into other companies; and     engage in transactions with affiliates.In addition,  the indentures andagreements governing the Companys  outstanding unsecured notes limit, among otherthings, the ability of the Company to enter into certain transactions,  such as mergers, consolidations,  asset sales, sale and leaseback transactions and the pledging ofassets.  In addition,  if the Company or certain of its subsidiaries  experience specific kinds of changes of control, the Companys credit facilities are due andpayable and the Company must offer to repurchase outstanding notes. The breach of any of these covenants  by the  Company or the failure by the Company to meet any of these  ratios or conditions  could result in a default under any or all of such  indebtedness.  If adefault occurs under any such  indebtedness,  all of the  outstanding obligations thereunder  could  become  immediately  due and  payable,  which  could  result in adefault  under  the  Companys  other outstanding  debt and could lead to anacceleration  of obligations  related to other  outstanding  debt. The ability of theCompany to comply with the  provisions of the credit  facilities,  the  agreements  orindentures  governing  other  indebtedness  it may incur in the future and its outstanding  secured and  unsecured  notes can be affected by events beyond its controland,  therefore,  it may be unable to meet those ratios and conditions. The  Company is subject to certain restrictions  that may limit its ability to make  payments  out of the cash  reserves shown in its consolidated financial statements. The ability of the  Companys subsidiaries  and joint  ventures to pay  dividends,  make  distributions,  provide loans or make other payments to the Company may be  restricted  by  applicable  stateand foreign  laws,  potentially  adverse tax  consequences  and their agreements, including  agreements  governing their debt. In addition,  the equity interests of theCompanys joint venture partners or other  shareholders in its non-wholly owned subsidiaries in any dividend or other distribution made by these entities would need tobe satisfied on a proportionate  basis with the Company.  As a result,  the Company maynot be able to access its cash flow to service its debt, and the amount of cash and cashflow reflected on its financial statements may not be fully available to the Company. Pending and future  asbestos litigation  and  payments to settle  asbestos-related  claims could  reduce the  Companys cash flow and negatively impact its financial condition. Crown Cork & Seal Company,  Inc. (Crown Cork) is one of many  defendants in a substantial  number of lawsuits filed  throughout the United States by persons  alleging  bodily injury as a result ofexposure to asbestos.  In 1963,  Crown Cork acquired a subsidiary that had two  operating businesses,  one of which is alleged  to have  manufactured  asbestos-containing insulation  products.  Crown Cork believes that the business ceased manufacturing suchproducts in 1963. The Company  recorded  pre-tax charges of $10  million,  $35  million,  $44  million,  $30 and $51 million to increaseits accrual for asbestos-related  liabilities in 2005,  2004,  2003,  2002 and 2001, respectively.  As of December 31, 2005,  Crown Corks accrual for pending and future asbestos-related  claims was $214  million  and Crown Cork  estimates  that its range of potential  liability  for pending and future  asbestos  claims that are probable and estimable is between $214 million and $272  million.  Crown Corks  accrual includes estimates for probable  costs for claims  through the year 2015.  The upper end of CrownCorks  estimated  range of possible asbestos  costs of $272  million  includes claims  beyond that date.  Assumptions  underlying  the accrual and the range of potential liability  include that claims for exposure to asbestos that occurred afterthe sale of the  subsidiarys  insulation  business in 1964 would not be entitled tosettlement  payouts and that the Texas,  Florida,  Pennsylvania,  Mississippi  and Ohio asbestos  legislation described  under Note M to the  consolidated financial  statements,  are  expected to have a highly  favorable  impact on Crown Corksability to settle or defend against asbestos-related claims in those states, and otherstates where Pennsylvania law may apply. -10-Crown Holdings, Inc. Crown Cork made cash payments of $29million,  $41 million,  $68 million,  $114 million and $118 million in 2005,  2004, 2003,2002 and 2001,  respectively,  for  asbestos-related  claims. These payments have reducedand any such future payments will reduce the cash flow available to Crown Cork for itsbusiness operations and debt payments. Asbestos-related  pay-outs  anddefense  costs may be  significantly  higher than those  estimated by Crown Cork becausethe outcome of this type of  litigation  (and,  therefore,  Crown  Corks  reserve and range of  potential  liabilities)  is  subject  to a number of assumptions anduncertainties,  such as the number or size of asbestos-related claims or settlements, the number of financially viable responsible  parties,  the extent to which Texas, Florida,  Ohio and Mississippi  statutes  relating to asbestos  liability are upheldand/or applied by Texas,  Florida,  Ohio and Mississippi courts,  respectively,  theextent to which a Pennsylvania statute relating to asbestos  liability is upheld and/orapplied by courts in states other than  Pennsylvania,  Crown Corks  ability toobtain  resolution without payment of asbestos-related claims  by  persons  allegingfirst  exposure to asbestos  after 1964,  and the potential  impact of any pending orfuture  asbestos-related  legislation,  including potential U.S.  federal  legislation described in the Companys  consolidated  financial  statements. Accordingly, Crown Cork may be required to make payments for claims  substantially in excess of itsaccrual and range of potential  liability,  which could reduce the Companys cashflow and impair its ability to satisfy its obligations. As a resultof the  uncertainties  regarding its  asbestos-related  liabilities  and its reduced cashflow, the ability of the Company to raise new money in the capital  markets is more difficult  and more  costly,  and the Company may not be able to access the capital markets in the future.  Further  information regarding Crown Corks asbestos-related  liabilities is presented within Managements  Discussionand Analysis of Financial  Condition and Results of Operations  under the headings,Provision  for  Asbestos  and  Liquidity and Capital  Resources  and under Note Mto the  consolidated  financial  statements. The Company has significant pensionplan obligations  worldwide and significant  underfunded U.S.  post-retirement obligations,  which could reduce its cash flow and negatively impact its financialcondition. The Company sponsors various pensionplans  worldwide,  with the largest funded plans in the U.K., U.S. and Canada.  In 2005,2004, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company contributed $401 million, $171 million, $122million, $44 million and $118 million,  respectively,  to these plans and  currently anticipates  its 2006  funding to be at least  $23 million.  The Company  may be required to make an  additional contribution  of  approximately  £30 to its  U.K. plan  in 2006  as a  result  of new  legislation  enacted  in  2005.  The  potentialcontribution  arose from the 2005 sale of the Companys plastic closures  business. Pension expense in 2006 is expected to decrease to approximately  $43 million  from $85million in 2005,  primarily  due to higher plan assets.  A 0.25%  change in the  expected rate of return would change 2006 pension expense by approximately  $10 million.  A 0.25%change in the discount rates would change 2006 pension expense by approximately $7million. The Company has  significant current  funding  obligations  for pension  benefits.  The Company  contributed  $323million to its U.S. pension plan in 2005.  Based on current  assumptions,  the Companyhas no minimum U.S.  pension  funding  requirement  in calendar year 2006. The Companys U.S.  pensionplan is  significantly  underfunded,  and its U.S.  retiree medical plans are unfunded. As of December 31, 2005, the Companys U.S.  pension plan was underfunded on atermination  basis by  approximately  $352 million.  The Companys  pension plan assets consist  primarily of common stocks and fixed income  securities.  If the  performanceof investments in the plan does not meet the Companys  assumptions,  the underfunding of the pension plan may increase and the Company may have to contribute additional funds to the pension plan. In addition,  federal  legislative  proposals havebeen made that could, if enacted,  require the Company to significantly  increase itsfunding  obligations to the plan and recently enacted legislation is expected to increasethe premiums paid by the Company to the Pension Benefit Guaranty  Corporation.  Theactual impact of this legislation  would depend upon the requirements of the legislation,if enacted,  contributions to and distributions  from the pension plan and the investment performance of the assets contributed  to the pension  plans.  An increase in pension contributions  and expenses could decrease the Companys cash available to pay itsoutstanding  obligations and its net income.  While its U.S. pension plan continues ineffect,  the Company  continues to incur additional pension obligations. -11-Crown Holdings, Inc. The Companys U.S. pension planis subject to the Employee  Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, or ERISA.  UnderERISA, the Pension Benefit Guaranty  Corporation,  or PBGC, has the authority toterminate an underfunded plan under certain  circumstances.  In the event its U.S. pension plan is terminated for any reason while the plan is underfunded,  the Companywill incur a liability to the PBGC that may be equal to the entire amount of theunderfunding. In addition,  as of December 31, 2005, the unfunded  accumulated  postretirement  benefit obligation,  calculatedin accordance with generally accepted accounting  principles,  for retiree medicalbenefits was approximately $639 million, based on assumptions set forth under Note W tothe consolidated financial statements. The Company could be liable forConstars  pension  obligations,  which could decrease cash available to satisfy its obligations and fund operations. Under  certain  circumstances,  theCompany may be liable for the pension  obligations  of Constar  International  Inc.,  theCompanys former  subsidiary  that engaged in an initial  public  offering in 2002, which could decrease the Companys cash available to pay its outstanding obligations.  At the time of the Constar initial public  offering,  Constar assumed sponsorship of the Companys  pension plan which covered all active and formerhourly employees and certain former salaried  employees of Constar.  Such plan wasunderfunded by approximately  $24 million when it was assumed by Constar.  The Constarpension plan is subject to ERISA.  Under ERISA, the PBGC has the authority to terminatean  underfunded  plan under certain  circumstances.  If the Constar  pension plan isterminated  within five years of the completion of the Constar initial public  offering, the PBGC may bring a claim under ERISA to hold the Company liable for the Constar pension plan  underfunding  if it is determined  that a principal  purpose of theConstar  initial public  offering was to evade pension  liability.  The Company does notbelieve that is the case.  The actual amount for which the Company may become liable inthe future  depends on the future  funding  status of the  Constar  pension  plan.  Inany case,  if this claim is brought  against the Company in the future, it may be costlyto defend and the claim may reduce the Companys liquidity. The Company has had net operatinglosses in the past and may not generate profits in the future. Operating  losses  could  limit the Companys  ability  to  service  its debt and fund its  operations.  For the fiscal  years  ended December 31,  2005, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company hadconsolidated  losses from continuing  operations before cumulative effect of a change inaccounting of approximately  $351 million,  $74 million,  $231 million and $1.0 billion, respectively.  The Company had net income of $16 million for the fiscal year endedDecember 31, 2004.  However, the Company may not generate net income in the future. The Companys  principal markets are subject to overcapacity and intense  competition,  which could reduce theCompanys net sales and net income. The worldwide  food and beverage canmarkets have  experienced  limited  growth in demand in recent  years.  Food and beveragecans are standardized  products,  allowing for relatively  little  differentiation  among competitors.  This has led to overcapacity  and price competition  among food and beverage  producers,  as capacity  growth  outpaced  the growth in demand for food and beverage  cans and overall  manufacturing  capacity  exceeded  demand.  These market conditions  reduced product prices,  which  contributed to declining revenue and netincome and  increasing  debt balances that the Company  experienced  in the past. As aresult of industry  overcapacity and price  competition,  the Company may not be able toincrease prices  sufficiently to offset higher costs or to generate  sufficient cashflow. The North American food and beverage can market, in particular,  is considered tobe a mature market,  characterized by slow growth and a  sophisticated  distribution system.  Price-driven  competition  has  increased as  producers  seek to capture moresales volumes in order to keep their plants operating at optimal levels and reduce unitcosts. Competitive  pricing  pressures, overcapacity,  the failure to develop new product designs and technologies  forproducts,  as well as other  factors  could cause the Company to lose  existing  businessor  opportunities  to generate  new  business  and could  result in decreased cash flowand net income. -12-Crown Holdings, Inc. The Company is subject tocompetition from substitute products, which could result in lower profits and reducedcash flows. The Company is subject tosubstantial  competition  from producers of alternative  packaging made from glass, cardboard, andplastic,  particularly from  producers  of plastic food and  beverage  containers,  whosemarket has grown  substantially  over the past  several  years.  The Companys sales  depend  heavily on the volumes of sales by the  Companys  customers  in thefood and  beverage  markets.  Changes in preferences  for products and  packaging byconsumers of  prepackaged  food and beverage  cans  significantly  influence  the Companyssales.  Changes in  packaging by the  Companys  customers  may require the Companyto re-tool  manufacturing  operations,  which could require  material  expenditures.  Inaddition,  a decrease in the costs of, or a further  increase in consumer demand for, alternative packaging could result in lower profits and reduced cash flows for theCompany. The Company is subject to theeffects of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, which may reduce its net sales andcash flow. The Company is exposed tofluctuations in foreign  currencies as a significant  portion of its  consolidated netsales, and some of its costs,  assets and  liabilities,  are denominated in currencies other than the U.S.  dollar.  For the fiscal years ended  December 31, 2005,  2004 and2003, the Company  derived  approximately  70%, 69% and 68%,  respectively,  of its consolidated  net sales from sales in foreign  currencies.  In its consolidated financial  statements,  the Company  translates local currency  financial  results intoU.S. dollars based on average  exchange rates  prevailing  during a reporting  period. During times of a  strengthening  U.S.  dollar,  its reported  international  revenueand earnings  will be reduced  because the local  currency  will  translate  into fewerU.S.  dollars. Conversely,  a weakening  U.S.  dollar will  effectively  increase the dollar-equivalent  of the  Companys  expenses and  liabilities denominated inforeign  currencies.  The Companys  translation  and exchange  adjustments  reduced reported  income before tax by $94 million in 2005 and by $26 million in 2002,  and increased  reported  income  before tax by $98 million in 2004 and by $207 million in2003.  See  Managements  Discussion and Analysis of Financial  Condition andResults of  Operations - Financial  Position - Market  Risk. Although  the Company  may use financial instruments such as foreign currency forwards  from time to time to reduce its exposure to currency exchange rate  fluctuations  in some cases,  it may not elect orhave the ability to implement  hedges or, if it does  implement  them, they may notachieve the desired effect. The Companys internationaloperations are subject to various risks that may lead to decreases in its financialresults. The risks  associated  withoperating in foreign  countries may have a negative impact on the Companys liquidity and net income.  The Companys  international  operations  generated approximately  70%, 69% and 68% of its  consolidated net sales in 2005, 2004 and 2003,respectively.  The business strategy of the Company includes continued expansion ofinternational  activities.  However,  the Companys international operations aresubject to various risks associated with operating in foreign countries, including:      restrictive trade policies;     inconsistent product regulation or policy changes by foreign agencies or governments;     duties, taxes or government royalties,  including the imposition or increase ofwithholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by non-U.S. subsidiaries;     customs, import/export and other trade compliance regulations;     foreign exchange rate risks;     difficulty in collecting international accounts receivable and potentiallylonger payment cycles;     increased costs in maintaining international manufacturing and marketing efforts;     non-tariff barriers and higher duty rates;-13-Crown Holdings, Inc.      difficulties in enforcement of contractual obligations and intellectualproperty rights;     exchange controls, such as those found in Thailand;     national and regional labor strikes;     language and cultural barriers;     high social benefit costs for labor, including costs associated with restructurings;     political, social, legal and economic instability;     taking of property by nationalization or expropriation without fair compensation;     imposition of limitations on  conversions  of foreign  currencies  intodollars or payment of dividends and other payments by non-U.S. subsidiaries;     hyperinflation and currency  devaluation in certain foreign  countries,including the countries of Eastern Europe and Turkey,  where such currencydevaluation could affect the amount of cash generated by operations in those countries and thereby affect the Companysability to satisfy its obligations; and     war, civil disturbance and acts of terrorism.There can be no guarantee that a deterioration  of economic  conditions in countries in which the Company operates would not have a material impact. The Companys profits willdecline if the price of raw materials or energy rises and it cannot increase the price ofits products. The Company uses various rawmaterials,  such as aluminum and steel for metals packaging, in its manufacturing operations.  Sufficient quantities of these raw materials may not be available in thefuture.  Moreover, the prices of certain of these raw materials,  such as aluminum  and steel,  have  historically  been  subject  to  volatility.  In 2005,  consumption  of steel  and  aluminum  represented approximately  30%  and  28%,  respectively,  of  the Companys  consolidated  cost  of  products  sold,  excluding  depreciation  andamortization.  The average  market  price for steel used in packaging  increased approximately  20% and the average  price of aluminum ingot on the London Metal Exchangeincreased  approximately 16% during 2005. Supplier  consolidations and recent governmentregulations provide additional uncertainty as to the level of prices at which the Companymight be able to source raw materials in the future. As a result of price increases,  in2005 the Company  implemented  significant price increases in all of its steel andaluminum product categories.  There  can be no  assurance  that the  Company  will beable to fully  recover  from its  customers  the  impact  of steel surcharges  or steeland  aluminum  price  increases.  In  addition,  if the  Company is unable to  purchase steel or  aluminum  for a significant  period of time, the Companys  steel or aluminum-consuming  operations  would be disrupted.  The Company is continuing tomonitor this steel and aluminum prices situation and the effect on its operations. The Company may be subject toadverse price fluctuations and surcharges,  including recent steel price increases discussed above, when purchasing raw  materials.  While certain,  but not all, of theCompanys  contracts pass through raw material costs to customers,  the Company maybe unable to increase its prices to offset  unexpected  increases in raw material  costs without  suffering  reductions in unit volume,  revenue and operating  income.  Inaddition,  any price increases may take effect after related cost increases,  reducingoperating  income in the near term. If any of the Companys  principal  supplierswere to increase their prices  significantly,  impose substantial  surcharges  or wereunable to meet its  requirements  for raw  materials,  either or both of its revenues orprofits would decline. -14-Crown Holdings, Inc. In addition,  the  manufacturing facilities of the Company are  dependent,  in varying  degrees,  upon the  availability of processed energy,  such as natural  gas and  electricity.  Certain of these  energy sources  may become  difficult  or  impossible  to obtain on acceptable  terms due to external  factors or may only be  available  at  substantially  increased  costs,  whichcould  increase  the Companys costs or interrupt its business. The loss of a major customer and/orcustomer consolidation could reduce the Companys net sales and profitability. Many of the Companys largest customers have acquired  companies with similar or complementary  product lines. This consolidation has increased  the  concentration  of the  Companys  business  withits largest  customers.  In many cases,  such  consolidation  has been accompanied  bypressure  from  customers  for lower prices,  reflecting  the increase in the totalvolume of product  purchased or the elimination of a price  differential  between theacquiring  customer and the company  acquired.  Increased  pricing pressures from theCompanys customers may reduce the Companys net sales and net income. The majority of the  Companys sales are to companies  that have leading  market  positions in the sale of packaged food,  beverages, aerosol and health and beauty  products to  consumers.  Although noone customer  accounted for more than 10% of its net sales in 2005, 2004, or 2003, theloss of any of its major  customers,  a reduction in the purchasing  levels of these customers or an adverse change in the terms of supply  agreements with these customerscould reduce the Companys net sales and net income. A continued  consolidation ofthe Companys customers could exacerbate any such loss. The Companys business isseasonal and weather conditions could reduce the Companys net sales. The  Company  manufactures packaging  primarily  for the  food  and  beverage  can  market.  Its  sales  can be affected  by  weather conditions. Due  principally to the seasonal nature of the softdrink, brewing, iced tea and other beverage industries, in which demand is stronger during the summer months,  sales of the Companys  products have varied and areexpected to vary by quarter.  Shipments in the U.S. and Europe are typically  greater inthe second and third quarters of the year.  Unseasonably cool weather can reduce consumerdemand for certain  beverages  packaged in its  containers.  In addition,  poor weather conditions that reduce crop yields of packaged foods can decrease customer demand forits food containers. The  Company is subject to costs andliabilities related to stringent environmental and health and safety standards. Laws and  regulations  relating to environmental  protection  and health and safety may increase the Companys  costsof operating and reduce its  profitability.  The Companys  operations are subjectto numerous U.S. federal and state and non-U.S.  laws and regulations governing theprotection of the  environment,  including  those relating to treatment,  storage anddisposal of waste,  discharges into water, emissions into the atmosphere,  remediation ofsoil and groundwater  contamination and protection of employee health and safety. Futureregulations may impose stricter environmental requirements affecting the Companysoperations.  For example,  anticipated future restrictions  in some  jurisdictions  onair  emissions  of volatile  organic  compounds  and the use of certain  paint and lacquering ingredients may require the Company to employ  additional  control  equipmentor process  modifications.  The Companys  operations and properties, both in theU.S. and abroad, must comply with these laws and regulations. A number of governmental authorities  both in the U.S. and abroad have enacted,  or are  considering,  legal requirements  that would mandate certain rates of recycling,  the use of recycledmaterials and/or  limitations on certain kinds of packaging  materials such as plastics. In addition,  some companies with packaging  needs have responded to such  developments, and/or to perceived  environmental concerns of consumers,  by using  containers made inwhole or in part of recycled  materials.  Such  developments may reduce the demand forsome of the Companys  products,  and/or increase its costs. See Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial  Condition and Results  of  Operations - Financial Position - Environmental  Matters. -15-Crown Holdings, Inc. The Company has written down asignificant  amount of goodwill,  and a further writedown of goodwill would result inlower reported net income and a reduction of its net worth. Further  impairment of the Companys goodwill would require  additional  write-offs of goodwill,  which would reduce theCompanys net income in the period of any such write-off.  At December 31, 2005, thecarrying value of the Companys  goodwill was approximately $2.0 billion.  In July2001,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board issued  Statement  of Financial Accounting  Standards  No. 142, Goodwill and Other  Intangible  Assets. Underthe standard,  the Company is no longer  required to or permitted to amortize  goodwillreflected on its balance  sheet.  It is,  however,  required to evaluate  goodwill reflected on its balance  sheet when  circumstances indicate a potential  impairment andat least annually,  under the new impairment  testing guidelines  outlined in thestandard.  If it determines  that the goodwill is impaired,  the Company  would berequired to write-off a portion or all of the  goodwill.  The Company adopted thisstandard on January 1,  2002 and recorded a noncash,  non-tax  deductible  impairmentcharge of $1.0 billion,  reported as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting. If the Company  fails to retain key management  and  personnel  the Company may be unable to  implement  its  business  plan. Members of the Companys senior management have extensive  industry  experience,  and it would be difficult to find newpersonnel with comparable  experience.  Because the Companys  business is highly specialized,  we believe that it would also be difficult to replace the Companyskey technical  personnel.  The Company believes that its future success depends, in largepart, on its experienced senior management  team.  Losing the  services of key  membersof its  management  team could limit the  Companys  ability to  implement  itsbusiness plan. A significant  portion of the Companys workforce is unionized and labor  disruptions  could increase the Companys  costs andprevent the Company from supplying its customers. A  significant  portion of the Companys  workforce  is  unionized and a prolonged work stoppage or strikeat any facility with unionized  employees could increase its costs and prevent theCompany from supplying its customers.  In addition,  upon the expiration of existingcollective bargaining  agreements, the Company may not reach new  agreements  withoutunion action and any such new  agreements  may not be on terms  satisfactory  to theCompany. If the Company fails to maintain aneffective system of internal  controls,  the Company may not be able to accurately reportfinancial results or prevent fraud. Effective  internal controls arenecessary to provide reliable  financial  reports and to assist in the effective prevention of fraud. Any inability to provide  reliable  financial  reports or preventfraud could harm the  Companys  business.  The Company must annually evaluate itsinternal  procedures to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of2002, which requires  management and  auditors  to assess the  effectiveness  of internal controls.  If the Company  fails to remedy or  maintain  the  adequacy of its internal controls,  as such  standards  are  modified,  supplemented  or amended  from time totime,  the Company  could be subject to regulatory scrutiny, civil or criminal penaltiesor shareholder litigation. In addition,  failure to maintainadequate internal  controls could result in financial  statements that do not accurately reflect the Companys  financial  condition.  There can be no assurance  that the Companywill be able to complete the work necessary to fully comply with the  requirements  ofthe  Sarbanes-Oxley  Act or that the  Companys  management  and external auditors willcontinue to conclude that the Companys internal controls are effective. The Company is subject to litigationrisks which could negatively impact its operations and net income. The  Company is subject to various lawsuits  and claims with  respect to matters  such as  governmental,  environmental and  employee benefits laws and regulations,  securities,  labor, and actions arising outof the normal course ofbusiness,  in addition to  asbestos-related  litigation  described in Pending andfuture asbestos  litigation and  payments to settle  asbestos-related  claims couldreduce  the Companys cash flow and  negatively  impact its  financialcondition.  The Company is currently  unable to determine the total expense orpossible  loss, if any, that may ultimately be incurred in the  resolution  of such legal proceedings.  Regardless  of the ultimate  outcome of such legal  proceedings,  theycould result in significant  diversion of time by the Companys  management.  Theresults of the Companys  pending  legal  proceedings,  including any potential settlements,  are uncertain and the outcome of these disputes may decrease its cashavailable for operations and investment, restrict its operations or otherwise negativelyimpact its business, operating results, financial condition and cash flow. -16-Crown Holdings, Inc"
