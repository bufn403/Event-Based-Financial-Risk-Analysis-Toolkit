13,BC,BRUNSWICK CORP,2024-02-16,"  Risk Factors
Our operations and financial results are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including those described below, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock.RISKS RELATED TO ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONSWorldwide economic conditions significantly affect our industries and businesses, and economic decline can materially impact our financial results.In times of economic uncertainty or recession, consumers tend to have less discretionary income and defer significant spending on non-essential items, which may adversely affect our financial performance. Economic uncertainty caused by rising interest rates, inflation, international conflicts, and the macroeconomic environment may lead to unfavorable business outcomes. We continue to enhance our portfolio with new and/or expanded technologies, business models, services, and solutions that are less susceptible to economic cycles, but a portion of our business remains cyclical and sensitive to consumer spending on new engines, boats, and associated parts and accessories. Deterioration in general economic conditions that in turn diminishes consumer confidence or discretionary income may reduce our sales, or we may decide to lower pricing for our products, thus adversely affecting our financial results, including increasing the potential for future impairment charges. Further, most of our products are recreational, and consumers’ limited discretionary income may be diverted to other activities that occupy their time, such as other forms of recreational, religious, cultural, or community activities. We cannot predict the strength of global economies or the timing of economic recoveries, either worldwide or in the specific markets in which we compete.  Changes in currency exchange rates can adversely affect our results.Some of our sales are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. Consequently, a strong U.S. dollar may adversely affect reported revenues and our profitability. We have hedging programs in place to reduce our risk to currency fluctuations; however, we cannot hedge against all currency risks, especially over the long term. We maintain a portion of our cost structure in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which partially mitigates the impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar. This includes boats manufactured in Europe and Canada, and smaller outboard engines either manufactured in China or purchased from our joint venture in Japan. We also continue to evaluate the supply chain and cost structure for opportunities to further mitigate foreign currency risks.  We sell products manufactured in the U.S. into certain international markets, including Europe, Canada, Latin America and Asia-Pacific in U.S. dollars. Demand for our products in these markets may be diminished by a strengthening U.S. dollar, or we may need to lower prices to remain competitive. Some of our competitors with cost positions based outside the U.S., including Asian-based outboard engine manufacturers and European-based large fiberglass boat manufacturers, may have an improved cost position due to a strengthening U.S. dollar, which could result in pricing pressures on our products. Although these factors have existed for several years, we do not believe they have had a material adverse effect on our competitive position.Fiscal and monetary policy changes may negatively impact worldwide economic and credit conditions and adversely affect our industries, businesses, and financial condition.Fiscal and monetary policy could have a material adverse impact on worldwide economic conditions, the financial markets, and availability of credit and, consequently, may negatively affect our industries, businesses, and overall financial condition. Customers often finance purchases of our products, particularly boats, and as interest rates rise, the cost of financing the purchase also increases. If credit conditions worsen and adversely affect the ability of customers to finance potential purchases at acceptable terms and interest rates, it could result in a decrease in sales or delay improvement in sales.12Table of ContentsAdverse capital market conditions could have a negative impact on our financial results.We may rely on short-term capital markets to meet our working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures or pay dividends, and we maintain short-term borrowing facilities that can be used to meet these capital requirements. In addition, over the long term, we may determine that it is necessary to access the capital markets to refinance existing long-term indebtedness or to raise capital for other initiatives. Adverse economic and capital market conditions, market volatility, and regulatory uncertainty could negatively affect our ability to access capital markets or increase the cost to do so, which could adversely impact our business, financial results, and competitive position.Our profitability may suffer as a result of competitive pricing and other pressures.The introduction of lower-priced alternative products or services by other companies can hurt our competitive position in all of our businesses. We are constantly subject to competitive pressures in which predominantly international manufacturers may pursue a strategy of aggressive pricing, particularly during periods when their local currency weakens versus the U.S. dollar. Such pricing pressure may limit our ability to increase prices for our products in response to raw material and other cost increases and negatively affect our profit margins.In addition, our independent boat builder customers may react negatively to potential competition for their products from Brunswick's own boat brands, which can lead them to purchase marine engines, boat systems, parts and accessories, and marine engine supplies from competing manufacturers and may negatively affect demand for our products.Higher energy and fuel costs can affect our results.Higher energy and fuel costs increase operating expenses at our manufacturing facilities and the cost of shipping products to customers. In addition, increases in energy costs can adversely affect the pricing and availability of petroleum-based raw materials such as resins and foam that are used in many of our marine products. Higher fuel prices may also have an adverse effect on demand for our parts and accessories businesses, as they increase the cost of boat ownership and possibly affect product use.RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONSSuccessfully managing our manufacturing operations is critical to our operating and financial results.Over the past several years, we have made strategic capital investments in capacity expansion activities to successfully capture growth opportunities and enhance product offerings, including expansions at our Fond du Lac, Wisconsin and Ensenada, Mexico facilities. We also continue to implement manufacturing efficiency enhancements that are important to our success. Conversely, we may make decisions to decrease production at existing facilities or reduce our manufacturing footprint in accordance with our business strategy. We must carefully manage these capital improvement projects, expansions, efficiency enhancements, and any consolidation or decrease in capacity utilization to ensure the projects meet cost targets, comply with applicable environmental, safety, and other regulations, uphold high-quality workmanship, and meet our business goals.Moving production to a different plant, expanding capacity at an existing facility, and decreasing or ceasing production at a facility involves risks, including difficulties initiating production within the cost and timeframe estimated, supplying product to customers when expected, integrating new products, and attracting and retaining skilled workers. If we fail to meet these objectives, it could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand for products and increase the cost of production versus projections, both of which could result in a significant adverse impact on operating and financial results. Additionally, plant consolidation or expansion can result in manufacturing inefficiencies, additional expenses, including higher wages or severance costs, and cost inefficiencies, which could negatively impact financial results.13Table of ContentsLoss of key customers could harm our business.In each segment, we have important relationships with key customers, including White River Marine Group, LLC for the Propulsion and Navico Group segments and MarineMax, Inc. for the Boat segment. From time to time, contracts with these customers come up for renewal. We cannot be certain we will renew such contracts, or renew them on favorable terms. If we lose a key customer, or a significant portion of its business, we could be adversely affected. In addition, certain customers could try to negotiate more favorable pricing of our products, which could depress earnings. In an effort to mitigate the risk associated with reliance on key customer accounts, we continually monitor these relationships and maintain a complete and competitive product lineup. A material portion of our revenue is derived from international sources, which creates additional uncertainty.We intend to continue to expand our international operations and customer base as part of our growth strategy. Sales outside the United States, especially in emerging markets, are subject to various risks, including government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions, foreign currency effects, tariffs, customs duties, inflation, difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems, compliance with international laws, treaties, and regulations, changes in regulatory environments, disruptions in distribution, dependence on foreign personnel and unions, economic and social instability, and public health crises. In addition, there may be tax inefficiencies in repatriating cash from non-U.S. subsidiaries, or changes to tax laws that affect cash repatriation.  Instability, including, but not limited to, political events, civil unrest, and an increase in criminal activity in locations where we maintain a significant presence could adversely impact our manufacturing and business operations. Decreased stability poses a risk of business interruption and delays in shipments of materials, components, and finished goods, as well as a risk of decreased local retail demand for our products. In addition, political and economic uncertainty and shifts pose risks of volatility in other global markets, which could affect our operations and financial results. Changes in U.S. policy regarding foreign trade or manufacturing may create negative sentiment about the U.S. among non-U.S. customers, employees, or prospective employees, which could adversely affect our business, sales, hiring, and employee retention. If we continue to expand our business globally, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks, which could materially impact international operations or the business as a whole.Our financial results may be adversely affected by our third party suppliers' increased costs or inability to meet required production levels due to increased demand or disruption of supply of raw materials, parts, and product components.We rely on third parties to supply raw materials used in the manufacturing process, including oil, aluminum, copper, steel, and resins, as well as product parts and components. The prices for these raw materials, parts, and components fluctuate depending on market conditions and, in some instances, commodity prices or trade policies, including tariffs. Substantial increases in the prices of raw materials, parts, and components would increase our operating costs, and could reduce our profitability if we are unable to recoup the increased costs through higher product prices or improved operating efficiencies. Similarly, if a critical supplier were to close its operations, cease manufacturing, or otherwise fail to deliver an essential component necessary to our manufacturing operations, that could detrimentally affect our ability to manufacture and sell our products, resulting in an interruption in business operations and/or a loss of sales. In addition, some components used in our manufacturing processes, including certain engine components, furniture, upholstery, and boat windshields, are available from a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers. Operational and financial difficulties that these or other suppliers may face in the future could adversely affect their ability to supply us with the parts and components we need, which could significantly disrupt our operations. It may be difficult to find a replacement supplier for a limited or sole source raw material, part, or component without significant delay or on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, an uncorrected defect or supplier's variation in a raw material, part, or component, either unknown to us or incompatible with our manufacturing process, could jeopardize our ability to manufacture products.  14Table of ContentsSome additional supply risks that could disrupt our operations, impair our ability to deliver products to customers, and negatively affect our financial results include: •financial pressures on our suppliers due to a weakening economy or unfavorable conditions in other end markets; •supplier manufacturing constraints and investment requirements;•deterioration of our relationships with suppliers;•events such as natural disasters, power outages, or labor strikes; •disruption at major global ports and shipping hubs; or•an outbreak of disease or facility closures due to COVID-19 or a similar public health threat.These risks are exacerbated in the case of single-source suppliers, and the exclusive supplier of a key component could potentially exert significant bargaining power over price, quality, warranty claims, or other terms.We experienced supply shortages and increases in costs to certain materials in 2023. We continue to address these issues by identifying alternative suppliers for key materials and components, working to secure adequate inventories of critical supplies, and continually monitoring the capabilities of our supplier base. In the future, however, we may experience shortages, delayed delivery, and/or increased prices for key materials, parts, and supplies that are essential to our manufacturing operations.Adverse weather conditions and climate change events can have a negative effect on revenues.Changes in seasonal weather conditions can have a significant effect on our operating and financial results. Sales of our marine products are typically stronger just before and during spring and summer, and favorable weather during these months generally has a positive effect on consumer demand. Conversely, unseasonably cool weather, excessive rainfall, or drought conditions during these periods can reduce or change the timing of demand. Climate change could have an impact on longer-term natural weather trends, resulting in environmental changes including, but not limited to, increases in severe weather; changing sea levels; changes in sea, land, and air temperatures; poor water conditions; and reduced access to water, which could disrupt or negatively affect our business. Catastrophic events, including natural and environmental disasters, acts of terrorism, or civil unrest, could have a negative effect on our operations and financial results.Hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, storms, and catastrophic natural or environmental disasters, as well as acts of terrorism or civil unrest, could disrupt our distribution channel, operations, or supply chain and decrease consumer demand. If a catastrophic event takes place in one of our major markets, our sales could be diminished or our assets could be damaged. Additionally, if such an event occurs near our business locations, manufacturing facilities, or key supplier facilities, business operations and/or operating systems could be interrupted. We could be uniquely affected by weather-related catastrophic events, the severity of which may increase as a result of climate change, due to the location of certain of our boat facilities in coastal Florida, the size of the manufacturing operation in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, and Freedom Boat Club locations on waterfronts.Our ability to remain competitive depends on successfully introducing new products, experiences, and services that meet customer expectations.We believe that our customers look for and expect quality, innovation, and advanced features when evaluating and making purchasing decisions about products and services in the marketplace. Our ability to remain competitive and meet our growth objectives may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development, such as an inability to develop viable new products or customer solutions, gain market acceptance of new products, generate sufficient capital to fund new product development, or obtain adequate intellectual property protection for new products. To meet ever-changing consumer demands, timing of market entry, pricing of new products, and satisfying customers are all critical. As a result, we may not be able to introduce new products that are necessary to remain competitive in all markets that we serve. Furthermore, we must continue to meet or exceed customers' expectations regarding product quality, experiences, and after-sales service or our operating results could suffer.15Table of ContentsOur ability to meet demand in a rapidly changing environment may adversely affect our results of operations.Although we have remained focused on our strategic priorities, our businesses may experience difficulty in meeting demand, particularly in rapidly changing economic conditions. We may not be able to recruit or retain sufficient skilled labor or our suppliers may not be able to deliver sufficient quantities of parts and components for us to match production with forecasted demand. Consumers may pursue other recreational activities if our products are not readily available, consumers may purchase from competitors, or our fixed costs may grow, all of which could adversely impact our results of operations.We have a fixed cost base that can affect our profitability if demand decreases.The fixed cost levels of operating production facilities can put pressure on profit margins when sales and production decline. We have maintained discipline over our fixed cost base, and improvements in gross margin can help mitigate the risks related to a fixed cost base. However, our profitability is dependent, in part, on our ability to absorb fixed costs over an increasing number of products sold and shipped. Decreased demand or the need to reduce inventories can lower our production levels and impact our ability to absorb fixed costs, consequently materially affecting our results.Actual or potential public health emergencies, epidemics, or pandemics, such as COVID-19, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.The impact of actual or potential public health emergencies, epidemics, or pandemics on the Company, our suppliers, dealers, and customers, and the general economy could be wide-ranging and significant, depending on the nature of the issue, governmental actions taken in response, and the public reaction. The impact of such events could include employee illness, quarantines, cancellation of events and travel, business and school shutdowns, reduction in economic activity, and supply chain interruptions, which could cause significant disruptions to global economies and financial markets. In addition, these events could result in future significant volatility in demand, positively or negatively, for one or more of our products. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in disruption, uncertainty, and volatility in the global financial and credit markets, and similar future events could do the same. Such volatility could impact our access to capital resources and liquidity in the future, including making credit difficult to obtain or only available on less favorable terms. Impact on our operations could also be material, affecting employee absenteeism rates, facility closures, or adverse effects on customers or suppliers. These impacts could have a negative effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Some of our operations are conducted by joint ventures that are not operated solely for our benefit.We share ownership and management responsibilities with jointly owned companies such as BAC and Tohatsu Marine Corporation. These joint ventures may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities, or resources as we do because they are intended to be operated for the benefit of all co-owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. If our interests are not aligned, it could negatively impact our sales or financial results. 16Table of ContentsRISKS RELATED TO OUR STRATEGIC PLANSFailure to execute our strategic plan and growth initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.Our ability to continue generating strong cash flow and profits depends partly on the sustained successful execution of our strategic plan and growth initiatives, including optimizing our business and product portfolio, continuing to successfully integrate acquisitions, improving operating efficiency, and expanding into new adjacent markets. To address risks associated with our plan and growth initiatives, we have established processes to regularly review, manage, and modify our plans, and we believe we have appropriate oversight to monitor initiatives and their impact. However, our strategic plan and growth initiatives may require significant investment and management attention, which could result in the diversion of these resources from the core business and other business issues and opportunities. Additionally, any strategic plan is subject to certain risks, including market conditions, customer acceptance, competition, the ability to manufacture products on schedule and to specification, the supply chain, and/or the ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel. There is no assurance that we will be able to develop and successfully implement our strategic plan and growth initiatives in a manner that fully achieves our strategic objectives.Our business and operations are dependent on the expertise of our key contributors, our successful implementation of succession plans, and our ability to attract and retain management employees and skilled labor.The talents and efforts of our employees, particularly key managers, are vital to our success. Our management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace. We may be unable to retain them or to attract other highly qualified employees. Failure to hire, develop, and retain highly qualified and diverse employee talent and to develop and implement an adequate succession plan for the management team could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and our future success. We perform an annual review of management succession plans with the Board of Directors, including reviewing executive officer and other important positions to substantially mitigate the risk associated with key contributor transitions, but we cannot ensure that all transitions will be implemented successfully.Our ability to continue to execute our growth strategy could potentially be adversely affected by the effectiveness of organizational changes. Any disruption or uncertainty resulting from such changes could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Much of our future success depends on, among other factors, our ability to attract and retain skilled labor. If we are not successful in these efforts, we may be unable to meet our operating goals and plans, which may impact our financial results. We continually invest in automation and improve our efficiency, but availability and retention of skilled hourly workers remains critical to our operations. In order to manage this risk, we regularly monitor and make improvements to wages and benefit programs, as well as develop and improve recruiting, training, and safety programs to attract and retain an experienced and skilled workforce. The inability to successfully integrate acquisitions could negatively impact financial results.Our strategic acquisitions pose risks, such as our ability to project and evaluate market demand; maximize potential synergies and cost savings; make accurate accounting estimates; and achieve anticipated business objectives. Acquisitions present integration risks, including:•disruptions in core, adjacent, or acquired businesses that could make it more difficult to maintain business and operational relationships, including customer and supplier relationships;•the possibility that the expected synergies and value creation will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time period; •the possibility that we will incur unexpected costs and liabilities;•diversion of management attention; and•difficulties recruiting and retaining employees.  If we fail to timely and successfully integrate acquired businesses into existing operations, we may see higher costs, lost sales, or otherwise diminished earnings and financial results. 17Table of ContentsThere can be no assurance that strategic divestitures or restructurings will provide business benefits.As part of our strategy, we continuously evaluate our portfolio of businesses to further maximize shareholder value. We have previously, and may in the future, make changes to our portfolio which may be material. Divestitures involve risks, including difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products, and personnel, disruption in our operations or businesses, finding a suitable purchaser, the diversion of management's attention from our other businesses, the potential loss of key employees, adverse effects on relationships with our dealer or supplier partners or their businesses, the erosion of employee morale or customer confidence, and the retention of contingent liabilities related to the divested business. If we do not successfully manage the risks associated with divestitures, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected as the potential strategic benefits may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected. An inability to identify and complete targeted acquisitions could negatively impact financial results.Our growth initiatives include making strategic acquisitions when appropriate, which depend on the availability of suitable targets at acceptable terms and our ability to complete the transactions. In managing our acquisition strategy, we conduct rigorous due diligence, involve various functions, and continually review target acquisitions, all of which we believe mitigates some of our acquisition risks. However, we cannot assure that suitable acquisitions will be identified or consummated or that, if consummated, they will be successful. Acquisitions include a number of risks, including our ability to project and evaluate market demand, identify and realize potential synergies and cost savings, and make accurate financial forecasts, as well as diversion of management attention during the pursuit of acquisitions. Uncertainties exist in assessing the value, risks, profitability, and liabilities associated with certain businesses or assets, negotiating acceptable terms, obtaining financing on acceptable terms, and receiving any necessary regulatory approvals. As we continue to grow, in part, through acquisitions, our success depends on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these risks. Our failure to successfully do so could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.RISKS RELATED TO OUR DEALERS, DISTRIBUTORS, AND FRANCHISEESOur financial results could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective distribution.We rely on third-party dealers and distributors to sell most of our products. Maintaining a reliable network of dealers is essential to our success. We face competition from other manufacturers in attracting and retaining distributors and independent boat dealers. A significant deterioration in the number or effectiveness of our dealers and distributors could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.Although at present we believe dealer health to be generally favorable, weakening demand for marine products could hurt our dealers’ financial performance. In particular, reduced cash flow from decreases in sales and tightening credit markets could impair dealers' ability to fund operations. Inability to fund operations can force dealers to cease business, and we may be unable to obtain alternate distribution in the vacated market. An inability to obtain alternate distribution could unfavorably affect our net sales through reduced market presence. If economic conditions deteriorate, we anticipate that dealer failures or voluntary market exits would increase, especially if overall retail demand materially declines. Dealer or distributor inability to secure adequate access to capital could adversely affect our sales.Our dealers require adequate liquidity to finance their operations, including purchasing our products. Dealers are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could unfavorably affect their liquidity positions, including, among other things, continued access to adequate financing sources on a timely basis on reasonable terms. These financing sources are vital to our ability to sell products through our distribution network, particularly to boat and engine dealers. Entities affiliated with Wells Fargo & Company, including BAC, our 49 percent owned joint venture, finance a significant portion of our boat and engine sales to dealers through floor plan financing to marine dealers. 18Table of ContentsMany factors continue to influence the availability and terms of financing that our dealer floor plan financing providers offer, including: •their ability to access certain capital markets, such as the securitization and the commercial paper markets, and to fund their operations in a cost effective manner; •the performance of their overall credit portfolios; •their willingness to accept the risks associated with lending to marine dealers; •the overall creditworthiness of those dealers; and•the overall aging and level of pipeline inventories. Our sales could be adversely affected if financing terms change unfavorably or if BAC were to be terminated. This could require dealers to find alternative sources of financing, including our direct financing to dealers, which could require additional capital to fund the associated receivables.Inventory reductions by major dealers, retailers, and independent boat builders could adversely affect our financial results.If demand for our products declines or if new product introductions are expected to replace existing products, our dealers, retailers, and other distributors could decide to reduce the number of units they hold. These actions could result in wholesale sales reductions in excess of retail sales reductions and would likely result in lower production levels of certain products, potentially causing lower rates of absorption of fixed costs in our manufacturing facilities and lower margins. While we have processes in place to help manage dealer inventories at appropriate levels, potential inventory reductions remain a risk to our future sales and results of operations.We may be required to repurchase inventory or accounts of certain dealers.We have agreements with certain third-party finance companies to provide financing to our customers, enabling them to purchase our products. In connection with these agreements, we may either have obligations to repurchase our products from the finance company or have recourse obligations. These obligations may be triggered if our dealers default on their payment or other obligations to the finance companies.Our maximum contingent obligation to repurchase inventory and our maximum contingent recourse obligations on customer receivables are less than the total balances of dealer financings outstanding under these programs, because our obligations under certain of these arrangements are subject to caps or are limited based on the age of product. Our risk related to these arrangements is partially mitigated by the proceeds we receive on the resale of repurchased product to other dealers, or by recoveries on receivables purchased under the recourse obligations.Our inventory repurchase obligations relate mainly to the inventory floor plan credit facilities of our boat and engine dealers. Our actual historical repurchase experience related to these arrangements has been substantially less than our maximum contractual obligations. If dealers default on their obligations, file for bankruptcy, or cease operations, we could incur losses associated with the repurchase of our products. In addition, our net sales and earnings may be unfavorably affected due to reduced market coverage and an associated decline in sales.Future declines in marine industry demand could cause an increase in repurchase activity, or could require us to incur losses in excess of established reserves. In addition, our cash flow and loss experience could be adversely affected if repurchased inventory is not successfully distributed to other dealers in a timely manner, or if the recovery rate on the resale of the product declines. The finance companies could require changes in repurchase or recourse terms that would result in an increase in our contractual contingent obligations.The franchise business model of Freedom Boat Club presents risks.Our franchisees are an integral part of our Freedom Boat Club business and its growth strategies. We may be unable to successfully implement the growth strategies if our franchisees do not participate in the implementation of those strategies or if we are unable to attract a sufficient number of qualified franchisees. 19Table of ContentsWhile our franchisees are required to comply with our franchise and related agreements, our franchisees are independent and manage their boat clubs as independent businesses, responsible for all day-to-day operations of their boat clubs. If these franchisees fail to maintain or act in accordance with applicable brand standards; experience service, safety, or other operational problems, including any data breach involving club member information; or project a brand image inconsistent with ours, our image and reputation could suffer, which in turn could hurt our business and operating results.RISKS RELATED TO CYBERSECURITY AND TECHNOLOGYOur business operations could be negatively impacted by an outage or breach of our information technology systems, operational technology systems, or a cybersecurity event.We manage our global business operations through a variety of information technology (IT) and operational technology systems which we continually enhance to increase efficiency and security. We depend on these systems for commercial transactions, customer interactions, manufacturing, branding, employee tracking, and other applications. Some of the systems are based on legacy technology and operate with a minimal level of available support, and recent acquisitions using other systems have added to the complexity of our IT infrastructure. New system implementations across the enterprise also pose risks of outages or disruptions, which could affect our suppliers, commercial operations, and customers. We continue to upgrade, streamline, and integrate these systems and have invested in strategies to prevent a failure or breach but, like those of other companies, our systems are susceptible to outages due to natural disasters, power loss, computer viruses, security breaches, hardware or software vulnerabilities, disruptions, and similar events. In June 2023, Brunswick disclosed an IT security incident that impacted some systems and global facilities. We activated our response protocols, which included pausing operations in some locations, engaging leading security experts and coordinating with relevant law enforcement agencies. Normal global business operations resumed over the course of nine days following the incident. However, if a similar event occurred, and if legacy systems or other key systems were to fail or if our IT systems were unable to communicate effectively, this could result in missed or delayed sales or lost opportunities for cost-reduction or efficient cash management. We exchange information with many trading partners across all aspects of our commercial operations through our IT systems. A breakdown, outage, malicious intrusion, breach, ransom attack, or other disruption of communications could result in erroneous or fraudulent transactions, disclosure of confidential information, loss of reputation and confidence, and may also result in legal claims or proceedings, penalties, and remediation costs. We have numerous e-commerce and e-marketing portals and our systems may contain personal information of customers or employees; therefore, we must continue to be diligent in protecting against malicious cyber attacks. We have been the target of attempted cyber attacks and other security threats and we may be subject to future breaches of our IT systems. We have programs in place that are intended to detect, contain, and respond to data security incidents and that provide at least annual employee awareness training regarding phishing, malware, and other cyber risks. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. Moreover, the rapid evolution and increased adoption of artificial intelligence technologies may intensify our cybersecurity risks. If our security measures are breached or fail, unauthorized persons may be able to obtain access to or acquire personal or other confidential data. Depending on the nature of the information compromised, we may also have obligations to notify consumers and/or employees about the incident, and we may need to provide some form of remedy, such as a subscription to a credit monitoring service, for the individuals affected by the incident. For example, we provided certain affected individuals credit monitoring as a result of the June IT Security Incident. This or future events could negatively affect our relationships with customers or trading partners, lead to potential claims against us, and damage our image and reputation.20Table of ContentsWe rely on third parties for computing, storage, processing, and similar services. Any disruption of or interference with our use of these third-party services could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.Most of our business systems reside on third-party outsourced cloud infrastructure providers. We are therefore vulnerable to service interruptions experienced by these providers and could experience interruptions, delays, or outages in service availability in the future due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human, hardware or software errors, cyber attacks, hosting disruptions, and capacity constraints. While we have mitigation and service redundancy plans in place, outages and/or capacity constraints could still arise from a number of causes such as technical failures, natural disasters, fraud, or internal or third-party security attacks on us or our third-party providers, which could negatively impact our ability to manufacture and/or operate our business.  We collect, store, process, share, and use personal information, and rely on third parties that are not directly under our control to do so as well, which subjects us to legal obligations, laws and regulations related to security and privacy, and any actual or perceived failure to meet those obligations could harm our business.We are subject to various data protection and privacy laws and regulations in the countries where we operate because we collect, store, process, share, and use personal information, and we rely on third parties that are not directly under our control to do so as well. For example, we are subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union (EU) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Although we have implemented plans to comply with these laws, GDPR, CCPA, and future laws and regulations could impose even greater compliance burdens and risks with respect to privacy and data security than prior laws. The EU (through the GDPR) and a growing number of legislative and regulatory bodies elsewhere in the world have adopted consumer notification requirements in the event of unauthorized access to or acquisition of certain types of personal information. These breach notification laws continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. Complying with these obligations could cause us to incur substantial costs, require significant management time and attention, and increase negative publicity surrounding any incident that compromises personal information. RISKS RELATED TO OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTYOur success depends upon the continued strength of our brands.We believe that our brands, particularly including Mercury Marine, Boston Whaler, Lund, and Sea Ray, significantly contribute to our success, and that maintaining and enhancing these brands is important to expanding our customer base. A failure to adequately promote, protect, and strengthen our brands could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Further, in connection with the divestiture of the bowling and billiards businesses, we licensed certain trademarks and servicemarks, including use of the name ""Brunswick,"" to the acquiring companies. Our reputation may be adversely affected by the purchasers' inappropriate use of the marks or of the name Brunswick, including potential negative publicity, loss of confidence, or other damage to our image due to this licensed use.  Either inadequate intellectual property protection that could allow others to use our technologies and impair our ability to compete or the failure to successfully defend against patent infringement claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.We regard much of the technology underlying our products as proprietary. We rely on a combination of patents, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws; employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements; and other contracts to establish and protect our technology and other intellectual property rights. However, we remain subject to risks, including:•the steps we take to protect our proprietary technology may be inadequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology;•third parties may independently develop similar technology;•agreements containing protections may be breached or terminated;•we may not have adequate remedies for breaches; •existing patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws may afford limited protection;•a third party could copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization; or•we may be required to litigate to enforce our intellectual property rights, and we may not be successful.21Table of ContentsPolicing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult, particularly outside the U.S., and litigating intellectual property claims may result in substantial cost and divert management’s attention.  In addition, we may be required to defend our products against patent or other intellectual property infringement claims or litigation. Besides defense expenses and costs, we may not prevail in such cases, forcing us to seek licenses or royalty arrangements from third parties, which we may not be able to obtain on reasonable terms, or subjecting us to an order or requirement to stop manufacturing, using, selling, or distributing products that included challenged intellectual property, which could harm our business and financial results.RISKS RELATED TO OUR REGULATORY, ACCOUNTING, LEGAL, AND TAX ENVIRONMENTChanges to trade policy, tariffs, and import/export regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Changes in laws and policies governing trade could adversely affect our business and trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries. We continue to be subject to meaningful tariffs, such as China Section 301 investigation tariffs, and there is no assurance that we will be granted exclusions in the future. Like many other multinational corporations, we do a significant amount of business that would be affected by changes to the trade policies of the U.S. and foreign countries (including governmental action related to tariffs and international trade agreements). Such changes have the potential to adversely impact the U.S. economy, our industry, our suppliers, and global demand for our products and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill, trade names, and other long-lived assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth.Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as our trade names, are recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition and are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. In evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill and trade names, we make assumptions regarding future operating performance, business trends, and market and economic conditions. Such analyses further require us to make certain assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates, and discount rates. Uncertainties are inherent in evaluating and applying these factors to the assessment of goodwill and trade name recoverability. We could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill or trade names prior to the annual assessment if we experience business disruptions, unexpected significant declines in operating results, a divestiture of a significant component of our business, or declines in market capitalization.During the year ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded $16.6 million of intangible asset impairment charges recognized in Restructuring, exit and impairment charges in the Consolidated Statements of Operations, including a $13.0 million impairment of the Navico trade name as a result of declines in forecasted revenues primarily driven by macroeconomic factors and a decline in market conditions. Further, as part of our required fourth quarter goodwill impairment testing, the estimated fair value of the Navico Group reporting unit was approximately 10 percent in excess of its carrying value, which included goodwill of $599.7 million. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the impairment tests will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. To the extent future operating results differ from those in our current forecasts, or if the assumptions underlying the discount rates change, it is possible that further impairment charges could be recorded.We also continually evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of our definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets may warrant revision or whether the remaining balance of such assets may not be recoverable. We use an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flow over the remaining life of the asset in measuring whether the asset is recoverable.As of December 31, 2023, the balance of total goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets was $1,342.2 million, which represents approximately 22 percent of total assets. If the future operating performance of either the Company or individual operating segments is not sufficient, we could be required to record non-cash impairment charges. Impairment charges could substantially affect our reported earnings in the periods such charges are recorded. In addition, impairment charges could indicate a reduction in business value which could limit our ability to obtain adequate financing in the future.  22Table of ContentsWe manufacture and sell products that create exposure to potential claims and litigation.Our manufacturing operations and the products we produce could result in product quality, warranty, personal injury, property damage, and other issues, thereby increasing the risk of litigation and potential liability as well as regulatory fines. To manage this risk, we have established a global, enterprise-wide program charged with the responsibility for reviewing, addressing, and reporting on product integrity issues. Historically, the resolution of such claims has not had a materially adverse effect on our business, and we maintain what we believe to be adequate insurance coverage to mitigate a portion of these risks. However, we may experience material losses in the future, incur significant costs to defend claims or issue product recalls, experience claims in excess of our insurance coverage or that are not covered by insurance, or be subjected to fines or penalties. Our reputation may be adversely affected by such claims, whether or not successful, including potential negative publicity about our products. We record accruals for known potential liabilities, but there is the possibility that actual losses may exceed these accruals and therefore negatively impact earnings.Compliance with environmental, health, safety, zoning, and other laws and regulations may increase costs and reduce demand for our products.We are subject to federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, including product safety, environmental, health and safety, and other regulations. While we believe that we maintain the requisite licenses and permits and that we are in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations, a failure to satisfy these and other regulatory requirements could result in fines or penalties, and compliance could increase the cost of operations. The adoption of additional laws, rules, and regulations, including stricter emissions standards or limitations on the use of internal combustion engines, could increase our manufacturing costs, require additional product development investment, increase consumer pricing, and reduce consumer demand for our products or boat club operations.  Environmental restrictions, boat plant emission restrictions, and permitting and zoning requirements can limit production capacity, access to water for boating (or certain types of boats or propulsion) and marinas, and storage space. While future requirements, including any imposed on recreational boating, are not expected to be unduly restrictive, they may deter potential customers, thereby reducing our sales. Furthermore, regulations allowing the sale of fuel containing higher levels of ethanol for automobiles, which is not appropriate or intended for use in marine engines, may nonetheless result in increased warranty, service costs, customer dissatisfaction with products, and other claims against us if boaters mistakenly use this fuel in marine engines, causing damage to and the degradation of components in their marine engines. Many of our customers use our products for fishing and related recreational activities. Regulatory or commercial policies and practices impacting access to water, including availability of slip locations and/or the ability to transfer boats among different waterways, access to fisheries, or the ability to fish in some areas could negatively affect demand for our products. As we evolve our product electrification strategy, we are potentially subject to emerging regulations and requirements under the proposed European Union Battery Directive or other similar regulations. These requirements, if adopted, could increase our costs, potentially reducing consumer demand for our products.Our manufacturing processes involve the use, handling, storage, and contracting for recycling or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes. Accordingly, we are subject to regulations regarding these substances, and the misuse or mishandling of such substances could expose us to liabilities, including claims for property, personal injury, or natural resources damages, or fines. We are also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property, including cleanup efforts currently underway. If a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from one of our current or former properties or another location where we have disposed of hazardous materials, we may be held liable for the contamination, regardless of knowledge or whether we were at fault, and the amount of such liability could be material.Additionally, we are subject to laws governing our relationships with employees, including, but not limited to, employment obligations as a federal contractor and employee wage, hour, and benefits issues, such as health care benefits. Compliance with these rules and regulations, and compliance with any changes to current regulations, could increase the cost of our operations.23Table of ContentsChanges in income tax laws or enforcement could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.Our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability may be adversely impacted by changes in tax laws and interpretations in the U.S. or in other countries in which we operate. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) included various tax provisions, including a 15% minimum tax on global adjusted financial statement income. While we do not believe the IRA will have a material negative impact on our business, it is possible that future interpretations or additional tax law changes could have a material impact on the Company’s tax rate. In addition, many non-U.S. jurisdictions are implementing local legislation based upon the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s base erosion and profit shifting project. These changes could negatively impact our tax provision, cash flows, and/or tax-related balance sheet amounts, including our deferred tax asset values, and increase the complexity, burden, and cost of tax compliance.RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCKThe timing and amount of our share repurchases are subject to a number of uncertainties.The Board of Directors has authorized our discretionary repurchase of outstanding common stock, to be systematically completed in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. In 2023, we repurchased $275.0 million of shares, and we plan to continue share repurchases in 2024 and beyond. The amount and timing of share repurchases are based on a variety of factors. Important considerations that could cause us to limit, suspend, or delay future stock repurchases include:•unfavorable market and economic conditions;•the trading price of our common stock;•the nature and magnitude of other investment opportunities available to us from time to time;•the availability of cash; and•additional taxes imposed on share repurchases.  Delaying, limiting, or suspending our stock repurchase program may negatively affect performance versus earnings per share targets, and ultimately our stock price.Certain activist shareholder actions could cause us to incur expense and hinder execution of our strategy.We may at times be subject to certain divisive activist shareholder tactics, which can take many forms. Some shareholder activism, including potential proxy contests, could result in substantial costs, such as legal fees and expenses, and divert management’s and our Board’s attention and resources from our businesses and strategic plans. Additionally, public shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future, adversely affect our relationships with dealers, distributors, or customers, make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, and cause our stock price to fluctuate based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business. These risks could adversely affect our business and operating results"
8,BC,BRUNSWICK CORP,2023-02-16,"  Risk Factors
Our operations and financial results are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including those described below, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock.RISKS RELATED TO ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONSWorldwide economic conditions significantly affect our industries and businesses, and economic decline can materially impact our financial results.In times of economic uncertainty or recession, consumers tend to have less discretionary income and to defer significant spending on non-essential items, which may adversely affect our financial performance. Although portions of the marine industry experienced positive trends as a result of the unique consumer environment resulting from the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, economic uncertainty caused by rising interest rates, inflation, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and the macro-economic environment may lead to unfavorable business outcomes. We continue to enhance our portfolio with new and/or expanded technologies, business models, services, and solutions that are less susceptible to economic cycles, but a portion of our business remains cyclical and sensitive to consumer spending on new engines, boats, and associated parts and accessories. Deterioration in general economic conditions that in turn diminishes consumer confidence or discretionary income may reduce our sales, or we may decide to lower pricing for our products, thus adversely affecting our financial results, including increasing the potential for future impairment charges. Further, most of our products are recreational, and consumers’ limited discretionary income may be diverted to other activities that occupy their time, such as other forms of recreational, religious, cultural, or community activities. We cannot predict the strength of global economies or the timing of economic recoveries, either worldwide or in the specific markets in which we compete.  Changes in currency exchange rates can adversely affect our results.Some of our sales are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. Consequently, a strong U.S. dollar may adversely affect reported revenues and our profitability. We have hedging programs in place to reduce our risk to currency fluctuations; however, we cannot hedge against all currency risks, especially over the long term. We maintain a portion of our cost structure in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which partially mitigates the impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar. This includes boats manufactured in Europe and Canada, and smaller outboard engines either manufactured in China or purchased from our joint venture in Japan. We also continue to evaluate the supply chain and cost structure for opportunities to further mitigate foreign currency risks.  We sell products manufactured in the U.S. into certain international markets, including Canada, Europe, and Latin America, in U.S. dollars. Demand for our products in these markets may be diminished by a strengthening U.S. dollar, or we may need to lower prices to remain competitive. Some of our competitors with cost positions based outside the U.S., including Asian-based outboard engine manufacturers and European-based large fiberglass boat manufacturers, may have an improved cost position due to a strengthening U.S. dollar, which could result in pricing pressures on our products. Although these factors have existed for several years, we do not believe they have had a material adverse effect on our competitive position.Fiscal and monetary policy changes may negatively impact worldwide economic and credit conditions and adversely affect our industries, businesses, and financial condition.Fiscal and monetary policy could have a material adverse impact on worldwide economic conditions, the financial markets, and availability of credit and, consequently, may negatively affect our industries, businesses, and overall financial condition. Customers often finance purchases of our products, particularly boats, and as interest rates rise, the cost of financing the purchase also increases. If credit conditions worsen and adversely affect the ability of customers to finance potential purchases at acceptable terms and interest rates, it could result in a decrease in sales or delay improvement in sales.12Table of ContentsHigher energy and fuel costs can affect our results.Higher energy and fuel costs increase operating expenses at our manufacturing facilities and the cost of shipping products to customers. In addition, increases in energy costs can adversely affect the pricing and availability of petroleum-based raw materials such as resins and foam that are used in many of our marine products. Higher fuel prices may also have an adverse effect on demand for our parts and accessories businesses, as they increase the cost of boat ownership and possibly affect product use.Our profitability may suffer as a result of competitive pricing and other pressures.The introduction of lower-priced alternative products or services by other companies can hurt our competitive position in all of our businesses. We are constantly subject to competitive pressures in which predominantly international manufacturers may pursue a strategy of aggressive pricing, particularly during periods when their local currency weakens versus the U.S. dollar. Such pricing pressure may limit our ability to increase prices for our products in response to raw material and other cost increases and negatively affect our profit margins.In addition, our independent boat builder customers may react negatively to potential competition for their products from Brunswick's own boat brands, which can lead them to purchase marine engines, boat systems, parts and accessories, and marine engine supplies from competing manufacturers and may negatively affect demand for our products.Adverse capital market conditions could have a negative impact on our financial results.Adverse global economic conditions, market volatility, and regulatory uncertainty could lead to volatility and disruptions. We may rely on short-term capital markets to meet our working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures or pay dividends, and we maintain short-term borrowing facilities that can be used to meet these capital requirements. In addition, over the long term, we may determine that it is necessary to access the capital markets to refinance existing long-term indebtedness or to raise capital for other initiatives. Adverse economic and capital market conditions could negatively affect our ability to access capital markets or increase the cost to do so, which could adversely impact our business, financial results, and competitive position.RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONSOur financial results may be adversely affected by our third party suppliers' increased costs or inability to meet required production levels due to increased demand or disruption of supply of raw materials, parts, and product components.We rely on third parties to supply raw materials used in the manufacturing process, including oil, aluminum, copper, steel, and resins, as well as product parts and components. The prices for these raw materials, parts, and components fluctuate depending on market conditions and, in some instances, commodity prices or trade policies, including tariffs. Substantial increases in the prices of raw materials, parts, and components would increase our operating costs, and could reduce our profitability if we are unable to recoup the increased costs through higher product prices or improved operating efficiencies. Similarly, if a critical supplier were to close its operations, cease manufacturing, or otherwise fail to deliver an essential component necessary to our manufacturing operations, that could detrimentally affect our ability to manufacture and sell our products, resulting in an interruption in business operations and/or a loss of sales. In addition, some components used in our manufacturing processes, including certain engine components, furniture, upholstery, and boat windshields, are available from a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers. Operational and financial difficulties that these or other suppliers may face in the future could adversely affect their ability to supply us with the parts and components we need, which could significantly disrupt our operations. It may be difficult to find a replacement supplier for a limited or sole source raw material, part, or component without significant delay or on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, an uncorrected defect or supplier's variation in a raw material, part, or component, either unknown to us or incompatible with our manufacturing process, could jeopardize our ability to manufacture products.  13Table of ContentsSome additional supply risks that could disrupt our operations, impair our ability to deliver products to customers, and negatively affect our financial results include: •financial pressures on our suppliers due to a weakening economy or unfavorable conditions in other end markets; •supplier manufacturing constraints and investment requirements;•deterioration of our relationships with suppliers;•events such as natural disasters, power outages, or labor strikes; •disruption at major global ports and shipping hubs; or•an outbreak of disease or facility closures due to COVID-19 or a similar public health threat.These risks are exacerbated in the case of single-source suppliers, and the exclusive supplier of a key component could potentially exert significant bargaining power over price, quality, warranty claims, or other terms.As we increase production, our need for raw materials and supplies continues to increase. Our suppliers must be prepared to ramp-up operations and, in many cases, hire additional workers and/or expand capacity in order to fulfill our orders and those of other customers. Cost increases, defects, or sustained interruptions in the supply of raw materials, parts, or components our suppliers experience as they increase production create risks to our operations and financial results. We experienced supply shortages and increases in costs to certain materials in 2022. We continue to address these issues by identifying alternative suppliers for key materials and components, working to secure adequate inventories of critical supplies, and continually monitoring the capabilities of our supplier base. In the future, however, we may experience shortages, delayed delivery, and/or increased prices for key materials, parts, and supplies that are essential to our manufacturing operations.Successfully managing our manufacturing activity is critical to our operating and financial results.Over the past several years, we have made strategic capital investments in capacity expansion activities to successfully capture growth opportunities and enhance product offerings, including expansions at our Fond du Lac, Wisconsin and Ensenada, Mexico facilities. We also continue to implement manufacturing efficiency enhancements that are important to our success. Conversely, we may make decisions to reduce our manufacturing footprint in accordance with our business strategy. We must carefully manage these capital improvement projects, expansions, efficiency enhancements, and any consolidation efforts to ensure they meet cost targets, comply with applicable environmental, safety, and other regulations, and uphold high-quality workmanship.Moving production to a different plant, expanding capacity at an existing facility, or ceasing production at a facility involves risks, including difficulties initiating production within the cost and timeframe estimated, supplying product to customers when expected, integrating new products, and attracting skilled workers to handle additional production demands. If we fail to meet these objectives, it could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand for products and increase the cost of production versus projections, both of which could result in a significant adverse impact on operating and financial results. Additionally, plant consolidation or expansion can result in manufacturing inefficiencies, additional expenses, including higher wages or severance costs, and cost inefficiencies, which could negatively impact financial results.A material portion of our revenue is derived from international sources, which creates additional uncertainty.We intend to continue to expand our international operations and customer base as part of our growth strategy. Sales outside the United States, especially in emerging markets, are subject to various risks, including government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions, foreign currency effects, tariffs, customs duties, inflation, difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems, compliance with international laws, treaties, and regulations, unexpected changes in regulatory environments, such as the uncertainty surrounding the effect of the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as “Brexit,"" disruptions in distribution, dependence on foreign personnel and unions, economic and social instability, and public health crises, including the outbreak of pandemic or contagious disease, such as COVID-19 and variant strains. In addition, there may be tax inefficiencies in repatriating cash from non-U.S. subsidiaries, or changes to tax laws that affect cash repatriation.  14Table of ContentsInstability, including, but not limited to, political events, civil unrest, and an increase in criminal activity in locations where we maintain a significant presence could adversely impact our manufacturing and business operations. Decreased stability poses a risk of business interruption and delays in shipments of materials, components, and finished goods, as well as a risk of decreased local retail demand for our products. In addition, political and economic uncertainty and shifts pose risks of volatility in other global markets, which could affect our operations and financial results. Changes in U.S. policy regarding foreign trade or manufacturing may create negative sentiment about the U.S. among non-U.S. customers, employees, or prospective employees, which could adversely affect our business, sales, hiring, and employee retention. If we continue to expand our business globally, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks, which could materially impact international operations or the business as a whole.Actual or potential public health emergencies, epidemics, or pandemics, such as COVID-19, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.The impact of actual or potential public health emergencies, epidemics, or pandemics on the Company, our suppliers, dealers, and customers, and the general economy could be wide-ranging and significant, depending on the nature of the issue, governmental actions taken in response, and the public reaction. The impact of such events could include employee illness, quarantines, cancellation of events and travel, business and school shutdowns, reduction in economic activity, and supply chain interruptions, which could cause significant disruptions to global economies and financial markets. In addition, these events could result in future significant volatility in demand, positively or negatively, for one or more of our products. Demand volatility may be caused by, among other things: the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness, quarantine, or other travel restrictions; dealership closures due to illness or government restrictions; a reduction in boating activity as a result of governmental actions or self-quarantine measures; shifts in demand away from discretionary products; and reduced options for marketing and promotion of products. If such events occur over a prolonged period, they could increase our costs and difficulty of operating our business, including accurately planning and forecasting for our operations and inventory levels, which may adversely impact our results.The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in disruption, uncertainty, and volatility in the global financial and credit markets, and similar future events could do the same. Such volatility could impact our access to capital resources and liquidity in the future, including making credit difficult to obtain or only available on less favorable terms. Impact on our operations could also be material; for example, we could experience elevated absenteeism rates or facility closures. Additionally, we rely on original equipment manufacturers, dealers, and distributors to market and sell most of our products, and effects on their businesses or financial condition as a result of future pandemics could result in various adverse operational impacts including, but not limited to, lower sales, delayed cash payments, interrupted customer warranty service, and increased credit risk.Adverse weather conditions and climate change events can have a negative effect on revenues.Changes in seasonal weather conditions can have a significant effect on our operating and financial results. Sales of our marine products are typically stronger just before and during spring and summer, and favorable weather during these months generally has a positive effect on consumer demand. Conversely, unseasonably cool weather, excessive rainfall, or drought conditions during these periods can reduce or change the timing of demand. Climate change could have an impact on longer-term natural weather trends, resulting in environmental changes including, but not limited to, increases in severe weather; changing sea levels; changes in sea, land, and air temperatures; poor water conditions; and reduced access to water, which could disrupt or negatively affect our business. 15Table of ContentsCatastrophic events, including natural and environmental disasters, acts of terrorism, or civil unrest, could have a negative effect on our operations and financial results.Hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, storms, and catastrophic natural or environmental disasters, as well as acts of terrorism or civil unrest, could disrupt our distribution channel, operations, or supply chain and decrease consumer demand. If a catastrophic event takes place in one of our major markets, our sales could be diminished or our assets could be damaged. Additionally, if such an event occurs near our business locations, manufacturing facilities, or key supplier facilities, business operations and/or operating systems could be interrupted. We could be uniquely affected by weather-related catastrophic events, the severity of which may increase as a result of climate change, due to the location of certain of our boat facilities in coastal Florida, the size of the manufacturing operation in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, and Freedom Boat Club locations.Our ability to remain competitive depends on successfully introducing new products, experiences, and services that meet customer expectations.We believe that our customers look for and expect quality, innovation, and advanced features when evaluating and making purchasing decisions about products and services in the marketplace. Our ability to remain competitive and meet our growth objectives may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development, such as an inability to develop viable new products or customer solutions, gain market acceptance of new products, generate sufficient capital to fund new product development, or obtain adequate intellectual property protection for new products. To meet ever-changing consumer demands, timing of market entry, pricing of new products, and satisfying customers are all critical. As a result, we may not be able to introduce new products that are necessary to remain competitive in all markets that we serve. Furthermore, we must continue to meet or exceed customers' expectations regarding product quality, experiences, and after-sales service or our operating results could suffer.Loss of key customers could harm our business.In each segment, we have important relationships with key customers, including White River Marine Group, LLC and MarineMax, Inc. From time to time, contracts with these customers come up for renewal. We cannot be certain we will renew such contracts, or renew them on favorable terms. If we lose a key customer, or a significant portion of its business, we could be adversely affected. In addition, certain customers could try to negotiate more favorable pricing of our products, which could depress earnings. In an effort to mitigate the risk associated with reliance on key customer accounts, we continually monitor these relationships and maintain a complete and competitive product lineup. Our ability to meet demand in a rapidly changing environment may adversely affect our results of operations.Although we have remained focused on our strategic priorities, our businesses may experience difficulty in meeting demand, particularly in rapidly changing economic conditions. We may not be able to recruit or retain sufficient skilled labor or our suppliers may not be able to deliver sufficient quantities of parts and components for us to match production with forecasted demand. Consumers may pursue other recreational activities if our products are not readily available, consumers may purchase from competitors, or our fixed costs may grow, all of which could adversely impact our results of operations.We have a fixed cost base that can affect our profitability if demand decreases.The fixed cost levels of operating production facilities can put pressure on profit margins when sales and production decline. We have maintained discipline over our fixed cost base, and improvements in gross margin can help mitigate the risks related to a fixed cost base. However, our profitability is dependent, in part, on our ability to absorb fixed costs over an increasing number of products sold and shipped. Decreased demand or the need to reduce inventories can lower our production levels and impact our ability to absorb fixed costs, consequently materially affecting our results.16Table of ContentsSome of our operations are conducted by joint ventures that are not operated solely for our benefit.We share ownership and management responsibilities with jointly owned companies such as BAC and Tohatsu Marine Corporation. These joint ventures may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities, or resources as we do because they are intended to be operated for the benefit of all co-owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. If our interests are not aligned, it could negatively impact our sales or financial results. RISKS RELATED TO OUR STRATEGIC PLANSThe inability to successfully integrate acquisitions, including Navico, could negatively impact financial results.Our strategic acquisitions pose risks, such as our ability to project and evaluate market demand; maximize potential synergies and cost savings; make accurate accounting estimates; and achieve anticipated business objectives. We acquired Navico, a global leader in marine electronics and sensors, including multi-function displays, fish finders, autopilots, sonar, radar, and cartography, on October 4, 2021. This acquisition, other 2021 and 2022 acquisitions, and potential future acquisitions present integration risks, including:•disruptions in core, adjacent, or acquired businesses that could make it more difficult to maintain business and operational relationships, including customer and supplier relationships;•the possibility that the expected synergies and value creation will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time period; •the possibility that we will incur unexpected costs and liabilities;•diversion of management attention; and•difficulties recruiting and retaining employees.  If we fail to timely and successfully integrate acquired businesses, including Navico, into existing operations, we may see higher costs, lost sales, or otherwise diminished earnings and financial results. Failure to execute our strategic plan and growth initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.Our ability to continue generating strong cash flow and profits depends partly on the sustained successful execution of our strategic plan and growth initiatives, including optimizing our business and product portfolio, continuing to make and successfully integrate acquisitions, improving operating efficiency, and expanding into new adjacent markets. To address risks associated with our plan and growth initiatives, we have established processes to regularly review, manage, and modify our plans, and we believe we have appropriate oversight to monitor initiatives and their impact. However, our strategic plan and growth initiatives may require significant investment and management attention, which could result in the diversion of these resources from the core business and other business issues and opportunities. Additionally, any new initiative is subject to certain risks, including customer acceptance, competition, the ability to manufacture products on schedule and to specification, the ability to create the necessary supply chain, and/or the ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel. There is no assurance that we will be able to develop and successfully implement our strategic plan and growth initiatives in a manner that fully achieves our strategic objectives.Our business and operations are dependent on the expertise of our key contributors, our successful implementation of succession plans, and our ability to attract and retain management employees and skilled labor.The talents and efforts of our employees, particularly key managers, are vital to our success. Our management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace. We may be unable to retain them or to attract other highly qualified employees. Failure to hire, develop, and retain highly qualified and diverse employee talent and to develop and implement an adequate succession plan for the management team could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and our future success. We perform an annual review of management succession plans with the Board of Directors, including reviewing executive officer and other important positions to substantially mitigate the risk associated with key contributor transitions, but we cannot ensure that all transitions will be implemented successfully.17Table of ContentsOur ability to continue to execute our growth strategy could potentially be adversely affected by the effectiveness of organizational changes. Any disruption or uncertainty resulting from such changes could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Much of our future success depends on, among other factors, our ability to attract and retain skilled labor. In 2022, nearly all facilities sought to increase production and to hire and retain sufficient skilled hourly labor to meet increased demand for our products. In the future, if we are not successful in these efforts, we may be unable to meet our operating goals and plans, which may impact our financial results. We continually invest in automation and improve our efficiency, but availability and retention of skilled hourly workers remains critical to our operations. In order to manage this risk, we regularly monitor and make improvements to wages and benefit programs, as well as develop and improve recruiting, training, and safety programs to attract and retain an experienced and skilled workforce. An inability to identify and complete targeted acquisitions could negatively impact financial results.Our growth initiatives include making strategic acquisitions, which depend on the availability of suitable targets at acceptable terms and our ability to complete the transactions. In managing our acquisition strategy, we conduct rigorous due diligence, involve various functions, and continually review target acquisitions, all of which we believe mitigates some of our acquisition risks. However, we cannot assure that suitable acquisitions will be identified or consummated or that, if consummated, they will be successful. Acquisitions include a number of risks, including our ability to project and evaluate market demand, identify and realize potential synergies and cost savings, and make accurate financial forecasts, as well as diversion of management attention during the pursuit of acquisitions. Uncertainties exist in assessing the value, risks, profitability, and liabilities associated with certain businesses or assets, negotiating acceptable terms, obtaining financing on acceptable terms, and receiving any necessary regulatory approvals. As we continue to grow, in part, through acquisitions, our success depends on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these risks. Our failure to successfully do so could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.There can be no assurance that strategic divestitures or restructurings will provide business benefits.As part of our strategy, we continuously evaluate our portfolio of businesses to further maximize shareholder value. We have previously, and may in the future, make changes to our portfolio which may be material. Divestitures involve risks, including difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products, and personnel, disruption in our operations or businesses, finding a suitable purchaser, the diversion of management's attention from our other businesses, the potential loss of key employees, adverse effects on relationships with our dealer or supplier partners or their businesses, the erosion of employee morale or customer confidence, and the retention of contingent liabilities related to the divested business. If we do not successfully manage the risks associated with divestitures, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected as the potential strategic benefits may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected. RISKS RELATED TO OUR DEALERS, DISTRIBUTORS, AND FRANCHISEESOur financial results could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective distribution.We rely on third-party dealers and distributors to sell most of our products. Maintaining a reliable network of dealers is essential to our success. We face competition from other manufacturers in attracting and retaining distributors and independent boat dealers. A significant deterioration in the number or effectiveness of our dealers and distributors could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.Although at present we believe dealer health to be generally favorable, weakening demand for marine products could hurt our dealers’ financial performance. In particular, reduced cash flow from decreases in sales and tightening credit markets could impair dealers' ability to fund operations. Inability to fund operations can force dealers to cease business, and we may be unable to obtain alternate distribution in the vacated market. An inability to obtain alternate distribution could unfavorably affect our net sales through reduced market presence. If economic conditions deteriorate, we anticipate that dealer failures or voluntary market exits would increase, especially if overall retail demand materially declines. 18Table of ContentsDealer or distributor inability to secure adequate access to capital could adversely affect our sales.Our dealers require adequate liquidity to finance their operations, including purchasing our products. Dealers are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could unfavorably affect their liquidity positions, including, among other things, continued access to adequate financing sources on a timely basis on reasonable terms. These financing sources are vital to our ability to sell products through our distribution network, particularly to boat and engine dealers. Entities affiliated with Wells Fargo & Company, including BAC, our 49 percent owned joint venture, finance a significant portion of our boat and engine sales to dealers through floor plan financing to marine dealers. Many factors continue to influence the availability and terms of financing that our dealer floor plan financing providers offer, including: •their ability to access certain capital markets, such as the securitization and the commercial paper markets, and to fund their operations in a cost effective manner; •the performance of their overall credit portfolios; •their willingness to accept the risks associated with lending to marine dealers; •the overall creditworthiness of those dealers; and•the overall aging and level of pipeline inventories. Our sales could be adversely affected if financing terms change unfavorably or if BAC were to be terminated. This could require dealers to find alternative sources of financing, including our direct financing to dealers, which could require additional capital to fund the associated receivables.We may be required to repurchase inventory or accounts of certain dealers.We have agreements with certain third-party finance companies to provide financing to our customers, enabling them to purchase our products. In connection with these agreements, we may either have obligations to repurchase our products from the finance company or have recourse obligations. These obligations may be triggered if our dealers default on their payment or other obligations to the finance companies.Our maximum contingent obligation to repurchase inventory and our maximum contingent recourse obligations on customer receivables are less than the total balances of dealer financings outstanding under these programs, because our obligations under certain of these arrangements are subject to caps or are limited based on the age of product. Our risk related to these arrangements is partially mitigated by the proceeds we receive on the resale of repurchased product to other dealers, or by recoveries on receivables purchased under the recourse obligations.Our inventory repurchase obligations relate mainly to the inventory floor plan credit facilities of our boat and engine dealers. Our actual historical repurchase experience related to these arrangements has been substantially less than our maximum contractual obligations. If dealers default on their obligations, file for bankruptcy, or cease operations, we could incur losses associated with the repurchase of our products. In addition, our net sales and earnings may be unfavorably affected due to reduced market coverage and an associated decline in sales.Future declines in marine industry demand could cause an increase in repurchase activity, or could require us to incur losses in excess of established reserves. In addition, our cash flow and loss experience could be adversely affected if repurchased inventory is not successfully distributed to other dealers in a timely manner, or if the recovery rate on the resale of the product declines. The finance companies could require changes in repurchase or recourse terms that would result in an increase in our contractual contingent obligations.Inventory reductions by major dealers, retailers, and independent boat builders could adversely affect our financial results.If demand begins to decline or if new product introductions are expected to replace existing products, the Company and our dealers, retailers, and other distributors could decide to reduce the number of units they hold. These actions could result in wholesale sales reductions in excess of retail sales reductions and would likely result in lower production levels of certain products, potentially causing lower rates of absorption of fixed costs in our manufacturing facilities and lower margins. While we have processes in place to help manage dealer inventories at appropriate levels, potential inventory reductions remain a risk to our future sales and results of operations.19Table of ContentsThe franchise business model of Freedom Boat Club presents risks.Our franchisees are an integral part of our Freedom Boat Club business and its growth strategies. We may be unable to successfully implement the growth strategies if our franchisees do not participate in the implementation of those strategies or if we are unable to attract a sufficient number of qualified franchisees. While our franchisees are required to comply with our franchise and related agreements, our franchisees are independent and manage their boat clubs as independent businesses, responsible for all day-to-day operations of their boat clubs. If these franchisees fail to maintain or act in accordance with applicable brand standards; experience service, safety, or other operational problems, including any data breach involving club member information; or project a brand image inconsistent with ours, our image and reputation could suffer, which in turn could hurt our business and operating results.RISKS RELATED TO CYBERSECURITY AND TECHNOLOGYOur business operations could be negatively impacted by an outage or breach of our information technology systems, operational technology systems, or a cybersecurity event.We manage our global business operations through a variety of information technology (IT) and operational technology systems which we continually enhance to increase efficiency and security. We depend on these systems for commercial transactions, customer interactions, manufacturing, branding, employee tracking, and other applications. Some of the systems are based on legacy technology and operate with a minimal level of available support, and recent acquisitions using other systems have added to the complexity of our IT infrastructure. New system implementations across the enterprise also pose risks of outages or disruptions, which could affect our suppliers, commercial operations, and customers. We continue to upgrade, streamline, and integrate these systems and have invested in strategies to prevent a failure or breach but, like those of other companies, our systems are susceptible to outages due to natural disasters, power loss, computer viruses, security breaches, hardware or software vulnerabilities, disruptions, and similar events. If a legacy system or another of our key systems were to fail or if our IT systems were unable to communicate effectively, this could result in missed or delayed sales or lost opportunities for cost-reduction or efficient cash management.  We exchange information with many trading partners across all aspects of our commercial operations through our IT systems. A breakdown, outage, malicious intrusion, breach, ransom attack, or other disruption of communications could result in erroneous or fraudulent transactions, disclosure of confidential information, loss of reputation and confidence, and may also result in legal claims or proceedings, penalties, and remediation costs. We have numerous e-commerce and e-marketing portals and our systems may contain personal information of customers or employees; therefore, we must continue to be diligent in protecting against malicious cyber attacks. We have been the target of attempted cyber attacks and other security threats and we may be subject to breaches of our IT systems. We have programs in place that are intended to detect, contain, and respond to data security incidents and that provide at least annual employee awareness training regarding phishing, malware, and other cyber risks. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. If our security measures are breached or fail, unauthorized persons may be able to obtain access to or acquire personal or other confidential data. Depending on the nature of the information compromised, we may also have obligations to notify consumers and/or employees about the incident, and we may need to provide some form of remedy, such as a subscription to a credit monitoring service, for the individuals affected by the incident. This could negatively affect our relationships with customers or trading partners, lead to potential claims against us, and damage our image and reputation.20Table of ContentsWe rely on third parties for computing, storage, processing, and similar services. Any disruption of or interference with our use of these third-party services could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.Most of our business systems reside on third-party outsourced cloud infrastructure providers. We are therefore vulnerable to service interruptions experienced by these providers and could experience interruptions, delays, or outages in service availability in the future due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human, hardware or software errors, cyber attacks, hosting disruptions, and capacity constraints. While we have mitigation and service redundancy plans in place, outages and/or capacity constraints could still arise from a number of causes such as technical failures, natural disasters, fraud, or internal or third-party security attacks on us or our third-party providers, which could negatively impact our ability to manufacture and/or operate our business.  We collect, store, process, share, and use personal information, and rely on third parties that are not directly under our control to do so as well, which subjects us to legal obligations, laws and regulations related to security and privacy, and any actual or perceived failure to meet those obligations could harm our business.We are subject to various data protection and privacy laws and regulations in the countries where we operate because we collect, store, process, share, and use personal information, and we rely on third parties that are not directly under our control to do so as well. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union (EU) went into effect in May 2018 and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) became effective January 1, 2020. Although we have implemented plans to comply with these laws, GDPR, CCPA, and future laws and regulations could impose even greater compliance burdens and risks with respect to privacy and data security than prior laws. The EU (through the GDPR) and a growing number of legislative and regulatory bodies elsewhere in the world have adopted consumer notification requirements in the event of unauthorized access to or acquisition of certain types of personal information. These breach notification laws continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. Complying with these obligations could cause us to incur substantial costs, require significant management time and attention, and increase negative publicity surrounding any incident that compromises personal information. RISKS RELATED TO OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTYOur success depends upon the continued strength of our brands.We believe that our brands, particularly including Mercury Marine, Boston Whaler, Lund, and Sea Ray, significantly contribute to our success, and that maintaining and enhancing these brands is important to expanding our customer base. A failure to adequately promote, protect, and strengthen our brands could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Further, in connection with the divestiture of the bowling and billiards businesses, we licensed certain trademarks and servicemarks, including use of the name ""Brunswick,"" to the acquiring companies. Our reputation may be adversely affected by the purchasers' inappropriate use of the marks or of the name Brunswick, including potential negative publicity, loss of confidence, or other damage to our image due to this licensed use.  21Table of ContentsEither inadequate intellectual property protection that could allow others to use our technologies and impair our ability to compete or the failure to successfully defend against patent infringement claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.We regard much of the technology underlying our products as proprietary. We rely on a combination of patents, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws; employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements; and other contracts to establish and protect our technology and other intellectual property rights. However, we remain subject to risks, including:•the steps we take to protect our proprietary technology may be inadequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology;•third parties may independently develop similar technology;•agreements containing protections may be breached or terminated;•we may not have adequate remedies for breaches; •existing patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws may afford limited protection;•a third party could copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization; or•we may be required to litigate to enforce our intellectual property rights, and we may not be successful.Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult, particularly outside the U.S., and litigating intellectual property claims may result in substantial cost and divert management’s attention.  In addition, we may be required to defend our products against patent or other intellectual property infringement claims or litigation. Besides defense expenses and costs, we may not prevail in such cases, forcing us to seek licenses or royalty arrangements from third parties, which we may not be able to obtain on reasonable terms, or subjecting us to an order or requirement to stop manufacturing, using, selling, or distributing products that included challenged intellectual property, which could harm our business and financial results.RISKS RELATED TO OUR REGULATORY, ACCOUNTING, LEGAL, AND TAX ENVIRONMENTChanges to U.S. trade policy, tariffs, and import/export regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Changes in laws and policies governing foreign trade could adversely affect our business and trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries. We continue to be subject to meaningful tariffs, and there is no assurance that we will be granted exclusions in the future. Like many other multinational corporations, we do a significant amount of business that would be affected by changes to the trade policies of the U.S. and foreign countries (including governmental action related to tariffs and international trade agreements). Such changes have the potential to adversely impact the U.S. economy, our industry, our suppliers, and global demand for our products and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill, trade names, and other long-lived assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth.Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as our trade names, are recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition and are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. In evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill and trade names, we make assumptions regarding future operating performance, business trends, and market and economic conditions. Such analyses further require us to make certain assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates, and discount rates. Uncertainties are inherent in evaluating and applying these factors to the assessment of goodwill and trade name recoverability. We could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill or trade names prior to the annual assessment if we experience business disruptions, unexpected significant declines in operating results, a divestiture of a significant component of our business, or declines in market capitalization.We also continually evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of our definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets may warrant revision or whether the remaining balance of such assets may not be recoverable. We use an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flow over the remaining life of the asset in measuring whether the asset is recoverable.22Table of ContentsAs of December 31, 2022, the balance of total goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets was $1,273.0 million, which represents approximately 20 percent of total assets. If the future operating performance of either the Company or individual operating segments is not sufficient, we could be required to record non-cash impairment charges. Impairment charges could substantially affect our reported earnings in the periods such charges are recorded. In addition, impairment charges could indicate a reduction in business value which could limit our ability to obtain adequate financing in the future.  We manufacture and sell products that create exposure to potential claims and litigation.Our manufacturing operations and the products we produce could result in product quality, warranty, personal injury, property damage, and other issues, thereby increasing the risk of litigation and potential liability as well as regulatory fines. To manage this risk, we have established a global, enterprise-wide program charged with the responsibility for reviewing, addressing, and reporting on product integrity issues. Historically, the resolution of such claims has not had a materially adverse effect on our business, and we maintain what we believe to be adequate insurance coverage to mitigate a portion of these risks. However, we may experience material losses in the future, incur significant costs to defend claims or issue product recalls, experience claims in excess of our insurance coverage or that are not covered by insurance, or be subjected to fines or penalties. Our reputation may be adversely affected by such claims, whether or not successful, including potential negative publicity about our products. We record accruals for known potential liabilities, but there is the possibility that actual losses may exceed these accruals and therefore negatively impact earnings.Compliance with environmental, health, safety, zoning, and other laws and regulations may increase costs and reduce demand for our products.We are subject to federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, including product safety, environmental, health and safety, and other regulations. While we believe that we maintain the requisite licenses and permits and that we are in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations, a failure to satisfy these and other regulatory requirements could result in fines or penalties, and compliance could increase the cost of operations. The adoption of additional laws, rules, and regulations, including stricter emissions standards or limitations on the use of internal combustion engines, could increase our manufacturing costs, require additional product development investment, increase consumer pricing, and reduce consumer demand for our products or boat club operations.  Environmental restrictions, boat plant emission restrictions, and permitting and zoning requirements can limit production capacity, access to water for boating (or certain types of boats or propulsion) and marinas, and storage space. While future requirements, including any imposed on recreational boating, are not expected to be unduly restrictive, they may deter potential customers, thereby reducing our sales. Furthermore, regulations allowing the sale of fuel containing higher levels of ethanol for automobiles, which is not appropriate or intended for use in marine engines, may nonetheless result in increased warranty, service costs, customer dissatisfaction with products, and other claims against us if boaters mistakenly use this fuel in marine engines, causing damage to and the degradation of components in their marine engines. Many of our customers use our products for fishing and related recreational activities. Regulatory or commercial policies and practices impacting access to water, including availability of slip locations and/or the ability to transfer boats among different waterways, access to fisheries, or the ability to fish in some areas could negatively affect demand for our products. As we evolve our product electrification strategy, we are potentially subject to emerging regulations and requirements under the proposed European Union Battery Directive or other similar regulations. These requirements, if adopted, could increase our costs, potentially reducing consumer demand for our products.Our manufacturing processes involve the use, handling, storage, and contracting for recycling or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes. Accordingly, we are subject to regulations regarding these substances, and the misuse or mishandling of such substances could expose us to liabilities, including claims for property, personal injury, or natural resources damages, or fines. We are also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property, including cleanup efforts currently underway. If a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from one of our current or former properties or another location where we have disposed of hazardous materials, we may be held liable for the contamination, regardless of knowledge or whether we were at fault, and the amount of such liability could be material.23Table of ContentsAdditionally, we are subject to laws governing our relationships with employees, including, but not limited to, employment obligations as a federal contractor and employee wage, hour, and benefits issues, such as health care benefits. Compliance with these rules and regulations, and compliance with any changes to current regulations, could increase the cost of our operations.Changes in income tax laws or enforcement could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.Our provision for income taxes and cash tax liability may be adversely impacted by changes in tax laws and interpretations in the U.S. or in other countries in which we operate. On August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA), with various tax provisions, including a 15% minimum tax on global adjusted financial statement income. While we do not believe the IRA will have a material negative impact on our business, the full effects of the measures are unknown at this time. In addition, many non-U.S. jurisdictions are implementing local legislation based upon the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s base erosion and profit shifting project. These changes could negatively impact our tax provision, cash flows, and/or tax-related balance sheet amounts, including our deferred tax asset values, and increase the complexity, burden, and cost of tax compliance.RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCKThe timing and amount of our share repurchases are subject to a number of uncertainties.The Board of Directors has authorized our discretionary repurchase of outstanding common stock, to be systematically completed in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. In 2022, we repurchased $450.0 million of shares, and we plan to continue share repurchases in 2023 and beyond. The amount and timing of share repurchases are based on a variety of factors. Important considerations that could cause us to limit, suspend, or delay future stock repurchases include:•unfavorable market and economic conditions;•the trading price of our common stock;•the nature and magnitude of other investment opportunities available to us from time to time;•the availability of cash; and•additional taxes imposed on share repurchases.  Delaying, limiting, or suspending our stock repurchase program may negatively affect performance versus earnings per share targets, and ultimately our stock price.Certain activist shareholder actions could cause us to incur expense and hinder execution of our strategy.We may at times be subject to certain divisive activist shareholder tactics, which can take many forms. Some shareholder activism, including potential proxy contests, could result in substantial costs, such as legal fees and expenses, and divert management’s and our Board’s attention and resources from our businesses and strategic plans. Additionally, public shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future, adversely affect our relationships with dealers, distributors, or customers, make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, and cause our stock price to fluctuate based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business. These risks could adversely affect our business and operating results"
1,BC,BRUNSWICK CORP,2022-02-16,"  Risk Factors
Our operations and financial results are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including those described below, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock.RISKS RELATED TO ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONSWorldwide economic conditions significantly affect our industries and businesses, and economic decline can materially impact our financial results.In times of economic uncertainty or recession, consumers tend to have less discretionary income and to defer significant spending on non-essential items, which may adversely affect our financial performance. Although portions of the marine industry have experienced positive trends as a result of the unique consumer environment resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, these trends may not continue, and the accompanying economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic may lead to unfavorable business outcomes. We continue to develop our portfolio with new and/or expanded technologies, business models, services, and solutions that are less susceptible to economic cycles, but a portion of our business remains cyclical and sensitive to consumer spending on new engines, boats, and associated parts and accessories. Deterioration in general economic conditions that in turn diminishes consumer confidence or discretionary income may reduce our sales, or we may decide to lower pricing for our products, thus adversely affecting our financial results, including increasing the potential for future impairment charges. Further, most of our products are recreational, and consumers’ limited discretionary income may be diverted to other activities that occupy their time, such as other forms of recreational, religious, cultural, or community activities. We cannot predict the strength of global economies or the timing of economic recoveries, either worldwide or in the specific markets in which we compete.  Fiscal and monetary policy changes may negatively impact worldwide economic and credit conditions and adversely affect our industries, businesses, and financial condition.Fiscal and monetary policy could have a material adverse impact on worldwide economic conditions, the financial markets, and availability of credit and, consequently, may negatively affect our industries, businesses, and overall financial condition. Customers often finance purchases of our products, particularly boats, and as interest rates rise, the cost of financing the purchase also increases. While credit availability is adequate to support demand and interest rates remain relatively low, if credit conditions worsen and adversely affect the ability of customers to finance potential purchases at acceptable terms and interest rates, it could result in a decrease in sales or delay improvement in sales.Adverse capital market conditions could have a negative impact on our financial results.Adverse global economic conditions, market volatility, and regulatory uncertainty could lead to volatility and disruptions in the capital markets. We may rely on short-term capital markets to meet our working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures or pay dividends, and we maintain short-term borrowing facilities that can be used to meet these capital requirements. In addition, over the long term, we may determine that it is necessary to access the capital markets to refinance existing long-term indebtedness or to raise capital for other initiatives. Adverse economic and capital market conditions could negatively affect our ability to access capital markets or increase the cost to do so, which could adversely impact our business, financial results, and competitive position. Changes in currency exchange rates can adversely affect our results.Some of our sales are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. Consequently, a strong U.S. dollar may adversely affect reported revenues and our profitability. We have hedging programs in place to reduce our risk to currency fluctuations; however, we cannot hedge against all currency risks, especially over the long term. We maintain a portion of our cost structure in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which partially mitigates the impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar. This includes boats manufactured in Europe and Canada, and smaller outboard engines either manufactured in China or purchased from our joint venture in Japan. We also continue to evaluate the supply chain and cost structure for opportunities to further mitigate foreign currency risks.  10Table of ContentsWe sell products manufactured in the U.S. into certain international markets, including Canada, Europe, and Latin America, in U.S. dollars. Demand for our products in these markets may be diminished by a strengthening U.S. dollar, or we may need to lower prices to remain competitive. Some of our competitors with cost positions based outside the U.S., including Asian-based outboard engine manufacturers and European-based large fiberglass boat manufacturers, may have an improved cost position due to a strengthening U.S. dollar, which could result in pricing pressures on our products. Although these factors have existed for several years, we do not believe they have had a material adverse effect on our competitive position.Higher energy and fuel costs can affect our results.Higher energy and fuel costs increase operating expenses at our manufacturing facilities and the cost of shipping products to customers. In addition, increases in energy costs can adversely affect the pricing and availability of petroleum-based raw materials such as resins and foam that are used in many of our marine products. Higher fuel prices may also have an adverse effect on demand for our parts and accessories businesses, as they increase the cost of boat ownership and possibly affect product use.Our profitability may suffer as a result of competitive pricing and other pressures.The introduction of lower-priced alternative products or services by other companies can hurt our competitive position in all of our businesses. We are constantly subject to competitive pressures in which predominantly international manufacturers may pursue a strategy of aggressive pricing, particularly during periods when their local currency weakens versus the U.S. dollar. Such pricing pressure may limit our ability to increase prices for our products in response to raw material and other cost increases and negatively affect our profit margins.In addition, our independent boat builder customers may react negatively to potential competition for their products from Brunswick's own boat brands, which can lead them to purchase marine engines, boat systems, parts and accessories, and marine engine supplies from competing manufacturers and may negatively affect demand for our products.We are vulnerable to interest-rate risk with respect to our debt.The United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), announced in July 2017 that it will no longer persuade or require banks to submit rates for LIBOR after 2021. In March 2021, the FCA confirmed its intention to stop requiring banks to submit rates required to calculate LIBOR after 2021. However, for U.S. dollar-denominated (USD) LIBOR, only one-week and two-month USD LIBOR will cease to be published after 2021, and all remaining USD LIBOR tenors will continue being published until June 2023. Our variable-rate indebtedness and financing programs, including wholesale financing arrangements through BAC, may use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the rate. There is uncertainty regarding the timing of the discontinuation, modification, and reform of LIBOR and other interest-rate benchmarks and the implementation of alternative reference rates, including the secured overnight financing rate or SOFR. Any such discontinuation, modification, or reform could result in an increase in our interest expense or make our interest expense more volatile. Our management continues to monitor the status and discussions regarding LIBOR and alternative reference rates.RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONSActual or potential public health emergencies, epidemics, or pandemics, such as the current coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.The impact of actual or potential public health emergencies, epidemics, or pandemics on the Company, our suppliers, dealers, and customers, and the general economy could be wide-ranging and significant, depending on the nature of the issue, governmental actions taken in response, and the public reaction. The impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic is continuing and includes illness, quarantines, cancellation of events and travel, business and school shutdowns, reduction in economic activity, and widespread supply chain interruptions, which collectively have caused significant disruptions to global economies and financial markets. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, demand for our products has generally increased versus prior periods. However, developments related to the pandemic and the emergence of variant strains of COVID-19 could result in 11Table of Contentsfuture significant volatility in demand, positively or negatively, for one or more of our products. Demand volatility may be caused by, among other things: the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness, quarantine, or other travel restrictions; dealership closures due to illness or government restrictions; a reduction in boating activity as a result of governmental actions or self-quarantine measures; shifts in demand away from discretionary products; and reduced options for marketing and promotion of products or other restrictions in connection with COVID-19. If such events occurred over a prolonged period, they could increase our costs and difficulty of operating our business, including accurately planning and forecasting for our operations and inventory levels, which may adversely impact our results.The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in, and may continue to result in, disruption, uncertainty, and volatility in the global financial and credit markets. Such volatility could impact our access to capital resources and liquidity in the future, including making credit difficult to obtain or only available on less favorable terms. The COVID-19 pandemic may continue to have an impact on our operations, which could be material. For example, many of our facilities have experienced above average absenteeism rates caused by illness or quarantine measures, and a key manufacturing and distribution facility in New Zealand was temporarily closed in 2021. The continuing impact on our business operations could include, but are not limited to, significant numbers of employees contracting COVID-19; facility closures as a result of state and local quarantine orders, safety precautions, employee illness, or self-quarantine measures; reductions in our operating effectiveness as our employees work from home or as a result of new workplace safety measures; unavailability of key personnel necessary to conduct our business activities; project delays; and supply chain or distribution interruptions and constraints. Additionally, we rely on original equipment manufacturers, dealers, and distributors to market and sell most of our products, and effects on their businesses or financial condition as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could result in various adverse operational impacts including, but not limited to, lower sales, delayed cash payments, interrupted customer warranty service, and increased credit risk.Our efforts to manage, mitigate, and remedy these impacts may prove unsuccessful as the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of the pandemic, public safety actions taken by government authorities, long-term economic recovery, and resulting consumer response.Our financial results may be adversely affected by our third party suppliers' increased costs or inability to meet required production levels due to increased demand or disruption of supply of raw materials, parts, and product components.We rely on third parties to supply raw materials used in the manufacturing process, including oil, aluminum, copper, steel, and resins, as well as product parts and components. The prices for these raw materials, parts, and components fluctuate depending on market conditions and, in some instances, commodity prices or trade policies, including tariffs. Substantial increases in the prices of raw materials, parts, and components would increase our operating costs, and could reduce our profitability if we are unable to recoup the increased costs through higher product prices or improved operating efficiencies. Similarly, if a critical supplier were to close its operations, cease manufacturing, or otherwise fail to deliver an essential component necessary to our manufacturing operations, that could detrimentally affect our ability to manufacture and sell our products, resulting in an interruption in business operations and/or a loss of sales. In addition, some components used in our manufacturing processes, including certain engine components, furniture, upholstery, and boat windshields, are available from a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers. Operational and financial difficulties that these or other suppliers may face in the future could adversely affect their ability to supply us with the parts and components we need, which could significantly disrupt our operations. It may be difficult to find a replacement supplier for a limited or sole source raw material, part, or component without significant delay or on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, an uncorrected defect or supplier's variation in a raw material, part, or component, either unknown to us or incompatible with our manufacturing process, could jeopardize our ability to manufacture products.  Some additional supply risks that could disrupt our operations, impair our ability to deliver products to customers, and negatively affect our financial results include: •an outbreak of disease or facility closures due to COVID-19, or similar public health threat;•a deterioration of our relationships with suppliers;•events such as natural disasters, power outages, or labor strikes; 12Table of Contents•financial pressures on our suppliers due to a weakening economy or unfavorable conditions in other end markets; •supplier manufacturing constraints and investment requirements; or•disruption at major global ports and shipping hubs.These risks are exacerbated in the case of single-source suppliers, and the exclusive supplier of a key component could potentially exert significant bargaining power over price, quality, warranty claims, or other terms.We continue to increase production; consequently, our need for raw materials and supplies continues to increase. Our suppliers must be prepared to ramp-up operations and, in many cases, hire additional workers and/or expand capacity in order to fulfill our orders and those of other customers. Cost increases, defects, or sustained interruptions in the supply of raw materials, parts, or components our suppliers experience as they increase production efforts create risks to our operations and financial results. We experienced supply shortages and increases in costs to certain materials in 2021. We continue to address these issues by identifying alternative suppliers for key materials and components, working to secure adequate inventories of critical supplies, and continually monitoring the capabilities of our supplier base. In the future, however, we may experience shortages, delayed delivery, and/or increased prices for key materials, parts, and supplies that are essential to our manufacturing operations.Successfully managing our manufacturing activity is critical to our operating and financial results.Over the past several years, we have made strategic capital investments in capacity expansion activities to successfully capture growth opportunities and enhance product offerings, including expansions at our Fond du Lac, Wisconsin; Reynosa, Mexico; and Vila Nova de Cerveira, Portugal facilities, and the re-opening of our Flagler County, Florida boat manufacturing facility. We also continue to implement manufacturing efficiency enhancements that are important to our success. Conversely, we may make decisions to reduce our manufacturing footprint in accordance with our business strategy. We must carefully manage these capital improvement projects, expansions, efficiency enhancements, and any consolidation efforts to ensure they meet cost targets, comply with applicable environmental, safety, and other regulations, and uphold high-quality workmanship.Moving production to a different plant, expanding capacity at an existing facility, or ceasing production at a facility involves risks, including difficulties initiating production within the cost and timeframe estimated, supplying product to customers when expected, integrating new products, and attracting skilled workers to handle additional production demands. If we fail to meet these objectives, it could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand for products and increase the cost of production versus projections, both of which could result in a significant adverse impact on operating and financial results. Additionally, plant consolidation or expansion can result in manufacturing inefficiencies, additional expenses, including higher wages or severance costs, and cost inefficiencies, which could negatively impact financial results.Adverse weather conditions and climate change events can have a negative effect on revenues.Changes in seasonal weather conditions can have a significant effect on our operating and financial results. Sales of our marine products are typically stronger just before and during spring and summer, and favorable weather during these months generally has a positive effect on consumer demand. Conversely, unseasonably cool weather, excessive rainfall, or drought conditions during these periods can reduce or change the timing of demand. Climate change could have an impact on longer-term natural weather trends, resulting in environmental changes including, but not limited to, increases in severe weather, changing sea levels, changes in sea, land, and air temperatures, poor water conditions, and reduced access to water, which could disrupt or negatively affect our business. Catastrophic events, including natural and environmental disasters, acts of terrorism, or civil unrest, could have a negative effect on our operations and financial results.Hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, storms, and catastrophic natural or environmental disasters, as well as acts of terrorism or civil unrest, could disrupt our distribution channel, operations, or supply chain and decrease consumer demand. If a catastrophic event takes place in one of our major markets, our sales could be diminished. Additionally, if such an event occurs near our business locations, manufacturing facilities, or key supplier facilities, business operations and/or operating systems could be interrupted. We could be uniquely affected by weather-related 13Table of Contentscatastrophic events due to the location of certain of our boat facilities in coastal Florida and the size of the manufacturing operation in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin.A material portion of our revenue is derived from international sources, which creates additional uncertainty.We intend to continue to expand our international operations and customer base as part of our growth strategy. Sales outside the United States, especially in emerging markets, are subject to various risks, including government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions, foreign currency effects, tariffs, customs duties, inflation, difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems, compliance with international laws, treaties, and regulations, and unexpected changes in regulatory environments, disruptions in distribution, dependence on foreign personnel and unions, economic and social instability, and public health crises, including the outbreak of pandemic or contagious disease, such as COVID-19 and emerging variant strains. In addition, there may be tax inefficiencies in repatriating cash from non-U.S. subsidiaries, or tax laws that affect this process may change.  Instability, including, but not limited to, political events, civil unrest, and an increase in criminal activity in locations where we maintain a significant presence could adversely impact our manufacturing and business operations. Decreased stability poses a risk of business interruption and delays in shipments of materials, components, and finished goods, as well as a risk of decreased local retail demand for our products.  The decision of the United Kingdom (UK) to exit from the European Union (EU) (Brexit) could cause disruptions to, and create uncertainty surrounding, our business. The effects of Brexit have been and are expected to continue to be far-reaching. Brexit and the perceptions as to its impact may adversely affect economic conditions in Europe and globally, continue to contribute to uncertainty regarding the regulation of data protection in the UK, disrupt the free movement of goods, services, and people between the UK and the EU, and lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations for the UK. The consequences of the withdrawal by the UK from the EU and the impact on markets, as well as the impact on our operations, remain highly uncertain. In addition, political and economic uncertainty and shifts pose risks of volatility in other global markets, which could affect our operations and financial results. Changes in U.S. policy regarding foreign trade or manufacturing may create negative sentiment about the U.S. among non-U.S. customers, employees, or prospective employees, which could adversely affect our business, sales, hiring, and employee retention. If we continue to expand our business globally, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks, which could materially impact international operations or the business as a whole.Our ability to remain competitive depends on successfully introducing new products, experiences, and services that meet customer expectations.We believe that our customers look for and expect quality, innovation, and advanced features when evaluating and making purchasing decisions about products and services in the marketplace. Our ability to remain competitive and meet our growth objectives may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development, such as an inability to develop viable new products or customer solutions, gain market acceptance of new products, generate sufficient capital to fund new product development, or obtain adequate intellectual property protection for new products. To meet ever-changing consumer demands, timing of market entry, pricing of new products, and satisfying customers are all critical. As a result, we may not be able to introduce new products that are necessary to remain competitive in all markets that we serve. Furthermore, we must continue to meet or exceed customers' expectations regarding product quality, experiences, and after-sales service or our operating results could suffer.Our ability to meet demand in a rapidly changing environment may adversely affect our results of operations.Although we have remained focused on applying and enhancing COVID-19 health and safety protocols while continuing to increase global production, our businesses may experience difficulty in adapting to rapidly changing conditions, including government actions taken in response to emerging variants of COVID-19. In addition, we may not be able to recruit or retain sufficient skilled labor or our suppliers may not be able to deliver sufficient quantities of parts and components for us to match production with forecasted demand. In addition, consumers may pursue other recreational activities if dealer pipeline inventories fall too low and it is not convenient to purchase our 14Table of Contentsproducts, consumers may purchase from competitors, or our fixed costs may grow in response to increased demand, all of which could adversely impact our results of operations.Loss of key customers could harm our business.In each segment, we have important relationships with key customers, including White River Marine Group, LLC and MarineMax, Inc. From time to time, contracts with these customers come up for renewal. We cannot be certain we will renew such contracts, or renew them on favorable terms. If we lose a key customer, or a significant portion of its business, we could be adversely affected. In addition, certain customers could try to negotiate more favorable pricing of our products, which could depress earnings. In an effort to mitigate the risk associated with reliance on key customer accounts, we continually monitor these relationships and maintain a complete and competitive product lineup. We have a fixed cost base that can affect our profitability if demand decreases.The fixed cost levels of operating production facilities can put pressure on profit margins when sales and production decline. We have maintained discipline over our fixed cost base, and improvements in gross margin can help mitigate the risks related to a fixed cost base. However, our profitability is dependent, in part, on our ability to absorb fixed costs over an increasing number of products sold and shipped. Decreased demand or the need to reduce inventories can lower our production levels and impact our ability to absorb fixed costs, consequently materially affecting our results.Some of our operations are conducted by joint ventures that are not operated solely for our benefit.We share ownership and management responsibilities with jointly owned companies such as BAC and Tohatsu Marine Corporation. These joint ventures may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities, or resources as we do because they are intended to be operated for the benefit of all co-owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. If our interests are not aligned, it could negatively impact our sales or financial results. RISKS RELATED TO OUR STRATEGIC PLANSThe inability to successfully integrate acquisitions, including Navico, could negatively impact financial results.Our strategic acquisitions pose risks, such as our ability to project and evaluate market demand; maximize potential synergies and cost savings; make accurate accounting estimates; and achieve anticipated business objectives. We acquired Navico, a global leader in marine electronics and sensors, including multi-function displays, fish finders, autopilots, sonar, radar, and cartography, on October 4, 2021. This acquisition, other 2021 acquisitions, and potential future acquisitions present integration risks, including:•disruptions in core, adjacent, or acquired businesses that could make it more difficult to maintain business and operational relationships, including customer and supplier relationships;•the possibility that the expected synergies and value creation will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time period; •the possibility that we will incur unexpected costs and liabilities;•diversion of management attention; and•difficulties recruiting and retaining employees.  If we fail to timely and successfully integrate acquired businesses, including Navico, into existing operations, we may see higher costs, lost sales, or otherwise diminished earnings and financial results. Failure to successfully implement our strategic plan and growth initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.Our ability to continue generating strong cash flow and profits depends partly on the sustained successful execution of our strategic plan and growth initiatives, including optimizing our business and product portfolio, continuing to make acquisitions, improving operating efficiency, and expanding into new adjacent markets. To address risks associated with our plan and growth initiatives, we have established processes to regularly review, manage, and modify our plans, and we believe we have appropriate oversight to monitor initiatives and their impact. 15Table of ContentsHowever, our strategic plan and growth initiatives may require significant investment and management attention, which could result in the diversion of these resources from the core business and other business issues and opportunities. Additionally, any new initiative is subject to certain risks, including customer acceptance, competition, the ability to manufacture products on schedule and to specification, the ability to create the necessary supply chain, and/or the ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel. There is no assurance that we will be able to develop and successfully implement our strategic plan and growth initiatives in a manner that fully achieves our strategic objectives.Our business and operations are dependent on the expertise of our key contributors, our successful implementation of succession plans, and our ability to attract and retain management employees and skilled labor.The talents and efforts of our employees, particularly key managers, are vital to our success. Our management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace. We may be unable to retain them or to attract other highly qualified employees. Failure to hire, develop, and retain highly qualified and diverse employee talent and to develop and implement an adequate succession plan for the management team could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and our future success. We perform an annual review of management succession plans with the Board of Directors, including reviewing executive officer and other important positions to substantially mitigate the risk associated with key contributor transitions, but we cannot ensure that all transitions will be implemented successfully.Our ability to continue to execute our growth strategy could potentially be adversely affected by the effectiveness of organizational changes. Any disruption or uncertainty resulting from such changes could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Much of our future success depends on, among other factors, our ability to attract and retain skilled labor. In 2021, nearly all facilities sought to increase production and to hire and retain sufficient skilled hourly labor to meet increased demand for our products. In the future, if we are not successful in these efforts, we may be unable to meet our operating goals and plans, which may impact our financial results. We continually invest in automation and improve our efficiency, but availability and retention of skilled hourly workers remains critical to our operations. In order to manage this risk, we regularly monitor and make improvements to wages and benefit programs, as well as develop and improve recruiting, training, and safety programs to attract and retain an experienced and skilled workforce. An inability to identify and complete targeted acquisitions could negatively impact financial results.Our growth initiatives include making strategic acquisitions, which depend on the availability of suitable targets at acceptable terms and our ability to complete the transactions. In managing our acquisition strategy, we conduct rigorous due diligence, involve various functions, and continually review target acquisitions, all of which we believe mitigates some of our acquisition risks. However, we cannot assure that suitable acquisitions will be identified or consummated or that, if consummated, they will be successful. Acquisitions include a number of risks, including our ability to project and evaluate market demand, identify and realize potential synergies and cost savings, and make accurate financial forecasts, as well as diversion of management attention during the pursuit of acquisitions. Uncertainties exist in assessing the value, risks, profitability, and liabilities associated with certain businesses or assets, negotiating acceptable terms, obtaining financing on acceptable terms, and receiving any necessary regulatory approvals. As we continue to grow, in part, through acquisitions, our success depends on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these risks. Our failure to successfully do so could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.There can be no assurance that strategic divestitures or restructurings will provide business benefits.As part of our strategy, we continuously evaluate our portfolio of businesses to further maximize shareholder value. We have previously, and may in the future, make changes to our portfolio which may be material. Divestitures involve risks, including difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products, and personnel, disruption in our operations or businesses, finding a suitable purchaser, the diversion of management's attention from our other businesses, the potential loss of key employees, adverse effects on relationships with our dealer or supplier partners or their businesses, the erosion of employee morale or customer confidence, and the retention of contingent liabilities related to the divested business. If we do not successfully manage the risks associated with 16Table of Contentsdivestitures, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected as the potential strategic benefits may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected. RISKS RELATED TO OUR DEALERS, DISTRIBUTORS, AND FRANCHISEESOur financial results could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective distribution.We rely on third-party dealers and distributors to sell most of our products. Maintaining a reliable network of dealers is essential to our success. We face competition from other manufacturers in attracting and retaining distributors and independent boat dealers. A significant deterioration in the number or effectiveness of our dealers and distributors could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.Although at present we believe dealer health to be generally favorable, weakening demand for marine products could hurt our dealers’ financial performance. In particular, reduced cash flow from decreases in sales and tightening credit markets could impair dealers' ability to fund operations. Inability to fund operations can force dealers to cease business, and we may be unable to obtain alternate distribution in the vacated market. An inability to obtain alternate distribution could unfavorably affect our net sales through reduced market presence. If economic conditions deteriorate, we anticipate that dealer failures or voluntary market exits would increase, especially if overall retail demand materially declines. Dealer or distributor inability to secure adequate access to capital could adversely affect our sales.Our dealers require adequate liquidity to finance their operations, including purchasing our products. Dealers are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could unfavorably affect their liquidity positions, including, among other things, continued access to adequate financing sources on a timely basis on reasonable terms. These financing sources are vital to our ability to sell products through our distribution network, particularly to boat and engine dealers. Entities affiliated with Wells Fargo & Company, including BAC, our 49 percent owned joint venture, finance a significant portion of our boat and engine sales to dealers through floorplan financing to marine dealers. Many factors continue to influence the availability and terms of financing that our dealer floorplan financing providers offer, including: •their ability to access certain capital markets, such as the securitization and the commercial paper markets, and to fund their operations in a cost effective manner; •the performance of their overall credit portfolios; •their willingness to accept the risks associated with lending to marine dealers; •the overall creditworthiness of those dealers; and•the overall aging and level of pipeline inventories. Our sales could be adversely affected if financing terms change unfavorably or if BAC were to be terminated. This could require dealers to find alternative sources of financing, including our direct financing to dealers, which could require additional capital to fund the associated receivables.We may be required to repurchase inventory or accounts of certain dealers.We have agreements with certain third-party finance companies to provide financing to our customers, enabling them to purchase our products. In connection with these agreements, we may either have obligations to repurchase our products from the finance company or have recourse obligations. These obligations may be triggered if our dealers default on their payment or other obligations to the finance companies.Our maximum contingent obligation to repurchase inventory and our maximum contingent recourse obligations on customer receivables are less than the total balances of dealer financings outstanding under these programs, because our obligations under certain of these arrangements are subject to caps or are limited based on the age of product. Our risk related to these arrangements is partially mitigated by the proceeds we receive on the resale of repurchased product to other dealers, or by recoveries on receivables purchased under the recourse obligations.Our inventory repurchase obligations relate primarily to the inventory floorplan credit facilities of our boat and engine dealers. Our actual historical repurchase experience related to these arrangements has been substantially less than our maximum contractual obligations. If dealers default on their obligations, file for bankruptcy, or cease 17Table of Contentsoperations, we could incur losses associated with the repurchase of our products. In addition, our net sales and earnings may be unfavorably affected due to reduced market coverage and an associated decline in sales.Future declines in marine industry demand could cause an increase in repurchase activity, or could require us to incur losses in excess of established reserves. In addition, our cash flow and loss experience could be adversely affected if repurchased inventory is not successfully distributed to other dealers in a timely manner, or if the recovery rate on the resale of the product declines. The finance companies could require changes in repurchase or recourse terms that would result in an increase in our contractual contingent obligations.Inventory reductions by major dealers, retailers, and independent boat builders could adversely affect our financial results.If demand begins to trail forecasted levels or if new product introductions are expected to replace existing products, the Company and our dealers, retailers, and other distributors could decide to reduce the number of units they hold. These actions could result in wholesale sales reductions in excess of retail sales reductions and would likely result in lower production levels of certain products, potentially causing lower rates of absorption of fixed costs in our manufacturing facilities and lower margins. While we have processes in place to help manage dealer inventories at appropriate levels, potential inventory reductions remain a risk to our future sales and results of operations.The franchise business model of Freedom Boat Club presents risks.Our franchisees are an integral part of our Freedom Boat Club business and its growth strategies. We may be unable to successfully implement the growth strategies if our franchisees do not participate in the implementation of those strategies or if we are unable to attract a sufficient number of qualified franchisees. While our franchisees are required to comply with our franchise and related agreements, our franchisees are independent and manage their boat clubs as independent businesses, responsible for all day-to-day operations of their boat clubs. If these franchisees fail to maintain or act in accordance with applicable brand standards; experience service, safety, or other operational problems, including any data breach involving club member information; or project a brand image inconsistent with ours, our image and reputation could suffer, which in turn could hurt our business and operating results.RISKS RELATED TO CYBERSECURITY AND TECHNOLOGYOur business operations could be negatively impacted by an outage or breach of our information technology systems, operational technology systems, or a cybersecurity event.We manage our global business operations through a variety of information technology (IT) and operational technology systems which we continually enhance to increase efficiency and security. We depend on these systems for commercial transactions, customer interactions, manufacturing, branding, employee tracking, and other applications. Some of the systems are based on legacy technology and operate with a minimal level of available support, and recent acquisitions using other systems have added to the complexity of our IT infrastructure. New system implementations across the enterprise also pose risks of outages or disruptions, which could affect our suppliers, commercial operations, and customers. We continue to upgrade, streamline, and integrate these systems and have invested in strategies to prevent a failure or breach but, like those of other companies, our systems are susceptible to outages due to natural disasters, power loss, computer viruses, security breaches, hardware or software vulnerabilities, disruptions, and similar events. If a legacy system or another of our key systems were to fail or if our IT systems were unable to communicate effectively, this could result in missed or delayed sales or lost opportunities for cost reduction or efficient cash management.  We exchange information with many trading partners across all aspects of our commercial operations through our IT systems. A breakdown, outage, malicious intrusion, breach, ransom attack, or other disruption of communications could result in erroneous or fraudulent transactions, disclosure of confidential information, loss of reputation and confidence, and may also result in legal claims or proceedings, penalties, and remediation costs. We have numerous e-commerce and e-marketing portals and our systems may contain personal information of customers or employees; therefore, we must continue to be diligent in protecting against malicious cyber attacks. We have been the target of attempted cyber attacks and other security threats and we may be subject to breaches of our IT systems. We have programs in place that are intended to detect, contain, and respond to data security 18Table of Contentsincidents and that provide employee awareness training regarding phishing, malware, and other cyber risks. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. If our security measures are breached or fail, unauthorized persons may be able to obtain access to or acquire personal or other confidential data. Depending on the nature of the information compromised, we may also have obligations to notify consumers and/or employees about the incident, and we may need to provide some form of remedy, such as a subscription to a credit monitoring service, for the individuals affected by the incident. This could negatively affect our relationships with customers or trading partners, lead to potential claims against us, and damage our image and reputation.We rely on third parties for computing, storage, processing, and similar services. Any disruption of or interference with our use of these third-party services could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.Most of our business systems reside on third-party outsourced cloud infrastructure providers. We are therefore vulnerable to service interruptions experienced by these providers and could experience interruptions, delays, or outages in service availability in the future due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human, hardware or software errors, hosting disruptions, and capacity constraints. In 2021, Kronos time-keeping services, which we use in some of our facilities, was affected by a ransomware attack, although the event did not have a material effect on our operations. However, while we have mitigation and service redundancy plans in place, other outages and/or capacity constraints could still arise from a number of causes such as technical failures, natural disasters, fraud, or internal or third-party security attacks, which could negatively impact our ability to manufacture and/or operate our business.  We collect, store, process, share, and use personal information, and rely on third parties that are not directly under our control to do so as well, which subjects us to legal obligations, laws and regulations related to security and privacy, and any actual or perceived failure to meet those obligations could harm our business.We are subject to various data protection and privacy laws and regulations in the countries where we operate because we collect, store, process, share, and use personal information, and we rely on third parties that are not directly under our control to do so as well. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union (EU) went into effect in May 2018 and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) became effective January 1, 2020. Although we have implemented plans to comply with these laws, GDPR, CCPA, and future laws and regulations could impose even greater compliance burdens and risks with respect to privacy and data security than prior laws. The EU (through the GDPR) and a growing number of legislative and regulatory bodies elsewhere in the world have adopted consumer notification requirements in the event of unauthorized access to or acquisition of certain types of personal information. These breach notification laws continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. Complying with these obligations could cause us to incur substantial costs, require significant management time and attention, and increase negative publicity surrounding any incident that compromises personal information. RISKS RELATED TO OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTYOur success depends upon the continued strength of our brands.We believe that our brands, particularly including Mercury Marine, Boston Whaler, Lund, and Sea Ray, significantly contribute to our success, and that maintaining and enhancing these brands is important to expanding our customer base. A failure to adequately promote, protect, and strengthen our brands could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Further, in connection with the divestiture of the bowling and billiards businesses, we licensed certain trademarks and servicemarks, including use of the name ""Brunswick,"" to the acquiring companies. Our reputation may be adversely affected by the purchasers' inappropriate use of the marks or of the name Brunswick, including potential negative publicity, loss of confidence, or other damage to our image due to this licensed use.  19Table of ContentsEither inadequate intellectual property protection that could allow others to use our technologies and impair our ability to compete or the failure to successfully defend against patent infringement claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.We regard much of the technology underlying our products as proprietary. We rely on a combination of patents, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws; employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements; and other contracts to establish and protect our technology and other intellectual property rights. However, we remain subject to risks, including:•the steps we take to protect our proprietary technology may be inadequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology;•third parties may independently develop similar technology;•agreements containing protections may be breached or terminated;•we may not have adequate remedies for breaches; •existing patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws may afford limited protection;•a third party could copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization; or•we may be required to litigate to enforce our intellectual property rights, and we may not be successful.Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult, particularly outside the U.S., and litigating intellectual property claims may result in substantial cost and divert management’s attention.  In addition, we may be required to defend our products against patent or other intellectual property infringement claims or litigation. Besides defense expenses and costs, we may not prevail in such cases, forcing us to seek licenses or royalty arrangements from third parties, which we may not be able to obtain on reasonable terms, or subjecting us to an order or requirement to stop manufacturing, using, selling, or distributing products that included challenged intellectual property, which could harm our business and financial results.RISKS RELATED TO OUR REGULATORY, ACCOUNTING, LEGAL, AND TAX ENVIRONMENTChanges to U.S. trade policy, tariffs, and import/export regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Changes in laws and policies governing foreign trade could adversely affect our business and trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries. We continue to be subject to meaningful tariffs, and there is no assurance that we will be granted exclusions in the future. Like many other multinational corporations, we do a significant amount of business that would be affected by changes to the trade policies of the U.S. and foreign countries (including governmental action related to tariffs and international trade agreements). Such changes have the potential to adversely impact the U.S. economy, our industry, our suppliers, and global demand for our products and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill, trade names, and other long-lived assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth.Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as our trade names, are recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition and are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. In evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill and trade names, we make assumptions regarding future operating performance, business trends, and market and economic conditions. Such analyses further require us to make certain assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates, and discount rates. Uncertainties are inherent in evaluating and applying these factors to the assessment of goodwill and trade name recoverability. We could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill or trade names prior to the annual assessment if we experience business disruptions, unexpected significant declines in operating results, a divestiture of a significant component of our business, or declines in market capitalization.We also continually evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of our definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets may warrant revision or whether the remaining balance of such assets may not be recoverable. We use an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flow over the remaining life of the asset in measuring whether the asset is recoverable.20Table of ContentsAs of December 31, 2021, the balance of total goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets was $1,194.5 million, which represents approximately 22 percent of total assets. If the future operating performance of either the Company or individual operating segments is not sufficient, we could be required to record non-cash impairment charges. Impairment charges could substantially affect our reported earnings in the periods such charges are recorded. In addition, impairment charges could indicate a reduction in business value which could limit our ability to obtain adequate financing in the future.  We manufacture and sell products that create exposure to potential claims and litigation.Our manufacturing operations and the products we produce could result in product quality, warranty, personal injury, property damage, and other issues, thereby increasing the risk of litigation and potential liability as well as regulatory fines. To manage this risk, we have established a global, enterprise-wide program charged with the responsibility for reviewing, addressing, and reporting on product integrity issues. Historically, the resolution of such claims has not had a materially adverse effect on our business, and we maintain what we believe to be adequate insurance coverage to mitigate a portion of these risks. However, we may experience material losses in the future, incur significant costs to defend claims or issue product recalls, experience claims in excess of our insurance coverage or that are not covered by insurance, or be subjected to fines or penalties. Our reputation may be adversely affected by such claims, whether or not successful, including potential negative publicity about our products. We record accruals for known potential liabilities, but there is the possibility that actual losses may exceed these accruals and therefore negatively impact earnings.Compliance with environmental, health, safety, zoning, and other laws and regulations may increase costs and reduce demand for our products.We are subject to federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, including product safety, environmental, health and safety, and other regulations. While we believe that we maintain the requisite licenses and permits and that we are in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations, a failure to satisfy these and other regulatory requirements could result in fines or penalties, and compliance could increase the cost of operations. The adoption of additional laws, rules, and regulations, including stricter emissions standards, could increase our manufacturing costs, require additional product development investment, increase consumer pricing, and reduce consumer demand for our products or boat club operations.  Environmental restrictions, boat plant emission restrictions, and permitting and zoning requirements can limit production capacity, access to water for boating and marinas, and storage space. While future licensing requirements, including any licenses imposed on recreational boating, are not expected to be unduly restrictive, they may deter potential customers, thereby reducing our sales. Furthermore, regulations allowing the sale of fuel containing higher levels of ethanol for automobiles, which is not appropriate or intended for use in marine engines, may nonetheless result in increased warranty, service costs, customer dissatisfaction with products, and other claims against us if boaters mistakenly use this fuel in marine engines, causing damage to and the degradation of components in their marine engines. Many of our customers use our products for fishing and related recreational activities. Regulatory or commercial policies and practices impacting access to water, including availability of slip locations and/or the ability to transfer boats among different waterways, access to fisheries, or the ability to fish in some areas could negatively affect demand for our products.Our manufacturing processes involve the use, handling, storage, and contracting for recycling or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes. Accordingly, we are subject to regulations regarding these substances, and the misuse or mishandling of such substances could expose us to liabilities, including claims for property, personal injury, or natural resources damages, or fines. We are also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property, including cleanup efforts currently underway. If a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from one of our current or former properties or another location where we have disposed of hazardous materials, we may be held liable for the contamination, regardless of knowledge or whether we were at fault, and the amount of such liability could be material.Additionally, we are subject to laws governing our relationships with employees, including, but not limited to, employment obligations as a federal contractor and employee wage, hour, and benefits issues, such as health care benefits. Compliance with these rules and regulations, and compliance with any changes to current regulations, could increase the cost of our operations.21Table of ContentsChanges in income tax laws or enforcement could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.The US federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), signed into law on December 22, 2017, continues to have an overall positive impact on our financial statements, but certain expiring tax provisions (e.g., research and development and tangible property immediate expensing), administrative, and legislative changes that may result from the recent U.S. general elections as well as new or amended government regulations or guidance could have a negative impact. In addition, other changes in international and domestic tax laws, including developments at the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development that may change global taxing norms, and changes in tax law enforcement, could negatively impact our tax provision, cash flows, and/or tax-related balance sheet amounts, including our deferred tax asset values. Changes in U.S. and international tax laws may have broader implications, including impacts on the economy, currency markets, inflation, consumer behavior, and competitive dynamics, which are difficult to predict, and may positively or negatively impact us and our results.RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCKThe timing and amount of our share repurchases are subject to a number of uncertainties.The Board of Directors has authorized our discretionary repurchase of outstanding common stock, to be systematically completed in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. In 2021, we repurchased $120 million of shares, and we plan to continue share repurchases in 2022 and beyond. The amount and timing of share repurchases are based on a variety of factors. Important considerations that could cause us to limit, suspend, or delay future stock repurchases include:•unfavorable market and economic conditions;•the trading price of our common stock;•the nature and magnitude of other investment opportunities available to us from time to time; and•the availability of cash.  Delaying, limiting, or suspending our stock repurchase program may negatively affect performance versus earnings per share targets, and ultimately our stock price.Certain activist shareholder actions could cause us to incur expense and hinder execution of our strategy.We actively engage in discussions with our shareholders regarding further strengthening our Company and creating long-term shareholder value. This ongoing dialogue can include certain divisive activist tactics, which can take many forms. Some shareholder activism, including potential proxy contests, could result in substantial costs, such as legal fees and expenses, and divert management’s and our Board’s attention and resources from our businesses and strategic plans. Additionally, public shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future, adversely affect our relationships with dealers, distributors, or customers, make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, and cause our stock price to fluctuate based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business. These risks could adversely affect our business and operating results"

Our operations and financial results are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including those described below, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock.RISKS RELATED TO ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONSWorldwide economic conditions significantly affect our industries and businesses, and economic decline can materially impact our financial results.In times of economic uncertainty or recession, consumers tend to have less discretionary income and to defer significant spending on non-essential items, which may adversely affect our financial performance. Although portions of the marine industry have experienced positive trends as a result of the unique consumer environment resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, these trends may not continue, and the accompanying economic uncertainty caused by the pandemic may lead to unfavorable business outcomes. We continue to develop our portfolio with new and/or expanded technologies, business models, services, and solutions that are less susceptible to economic cycles, but a portion of our business remains cyclical and sensitive to consumer spending on new engines, boats, and associated parts and accessories. Deterioration in general economic conditions that in turn diminishes consumer confidence or discretionary income may reduce our sales, or we may decide to lower pricing for our products, thus adversely affecting our financial results, including increasing the potential for future impairment charges. Further, most of our products are recreational, and consumers’ limited discretionary income in times of economic hardship may be diverted to other activities that occupy their time, such as other forms of recreational, religious, cultural, or community activities. We cannot predict the strength of global economies or the timing of economic recovery, either worldwide or in the specific markets in which we compete.  Fiscal concerns and policy changes may negatively impact worldwide economic and credit conditions and adversely affect our industries, businesses, and financial condition.Fiscal policy could have a material adverse impact on worldwide economic conditions, the financial markets, and availability of credit and, consequently, may negatively affect our industries, businesses, and overall financial condition. Customers often finance purchases of our products, particularly boats, and as interest rates rise, the cost of financing the purchase also increases. While credit availability is adequate to support demand and interest rates remain relatively low, if credit conditions worsen and adversely affect the ability of customers to finance potential purchases at acceptable terms and interest rates, it could result in a decrease in sales or delay improvement in sales.Adverse credit and capital market conditions could have a negative impact on our financial results.Adverse global economic conditions, market volatility, and regulatory uncertainty could lead to volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. We may rely on short-term capital markets to meet our working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, pay dividends, or fund employee benefit programs, and we maintain short-term borrowing facilities that can be used to meet these capital requirements. In addition, over the long term, we may determine that it is necessary to access the capital markets to refinance existing long-term indebtedness or to raise capital for other initiatives. Adverse economic, credit, and capital market conditions could negatively affect our ability to access capital and credit markets or increase the cost to do so, which could adversely impact our business, financial results, and competitive position. In addition, our variable rate indebtedness and financing programs, including wholesale financing arrangements through BAC, may use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the rate. As announced in July 2017, LIBOR is expected to be phased out by the end of 2021. Uncertainty as to the nature of alternative reference rates and as to potential changes or other reforms to LIBOR may adversely impact the availability and cost of borrowings.Changes in currency exchange rates can adversely affect our results.Some of our sales are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. Consequently, a strong U.S. dollar may adversely affect reported revenues and our profitability. We have hedging programs in place to reduce our risk to currency fluctuations; however, we cannot hedge against all currency risks, especially over the long term. We maintain a portion of our cost structure in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which partially mitigates the impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar. This includes manufacturing operations for boats in Europe and Canada, and smaller outboard engines manufactured in China and 9Table of Contentspurchased from our joint venture in Japan. We also continue to evaluate the supply chain and cost structure for opportunities to further mitigate foreign currency risks.  We sell products manufactured in the U.S. into certain international markets in U.S. dollars, including to Canada, Europe, and Latin America. Demand for our products in these markets may be diminished by a strengthening U.S. dollar, or we may need to lower prices to remain competitive. Some of our competitors with cost positions based outside the U.S., including Asian-based outboard engine manufacturers and European-based large fiberglass boat manufacturers, may have an improved cost position due to a strengthening U.S. dollar, which could result in pricing pressures on our products. Although these factors have existed for several years, we do not believe they have had a material adverse effect on our competitive position.Higher energy and fuel costs can affect our results.Higher energy and fuel costs increase operating expenses at our manufacturing facilities and the cost of shipping products to customers. In addition, increases in energy costs can adversely affect the pricing and availability of petroleum-based raw materials such as resins and foam that are used in many of our marine products. Higher fuel prices may also have an adverse effect on demand for our parts and accessories businesses, as they increase the cost of boat ownership and possibly affect product use.Our profitability may suffer as a result of competitive pricing and other pressures.The introduction of lower-priced alternative products or services by other companies can hurt our competitive position in all of our businesses. We are constantly subject to competitive pressures in which predominantly international manufacturers may pursue a strategy of aggressive pricing, particularly during periods when their local currency weakens versus the U.S. dollar. Such pricing pressure may limit our ability to increase prices for our products in response to raw material and other cost increases and negatively affect our profit margins.In addition, our independent boat builder customers may react negatively to potential competition for their products from Brunswick's own boat brands, which can lead them to purchase marine engines, boat systems, and marine engine supplies from competing marine engine manufacturers and may negatively affect demand for our products.RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND OPERATIONSActual or potential public health emergencies, epidemics, or pandemics, such as the current coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.The impact of actual or potential public health emergencies, epidemics, or pandemics on the Company, our suppliers, dealers, and customers, and the general economy could be wide-ranging and significant, depending on the nature of the issue, governmental actions taken in response, and the public reaction. The impact of the current COVID-19 pandemic includes illness, quarantines, cancellation of events and travel, business and school shutdowns, reduction in economic activity, widespread unemployment, and supply chain interruptions, which collectively have caused significant disruptions to global economies and financial markets. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, demand in our products increased in the last two fiscal quarters of 2020 versus the same periods in 2019, but the pandemic could result in future significant volatility in demand, positively or negatively, for one or more of our products. Demand volatility may be caused by, among other things: the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness, quarantine, or other travel restrictions; dealership closures due to illness or government restrictions; a reduction in boating activity as a result of governmental actions or self-quarantine measures; shifts in demand away from discretionary products; and reduced options for marketing and promotion of products or other restrictions in connection with COVID-19. If such events occurred over a prolonged period, they could increase our costs and difficulty of operating our business, including accurately planning and forecasting for our operations and inventory levels, which may adversely impact our results.The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in, and may continue to result in, disruption, uncertainty, and volatility in the global financial and credit markets. Such volatility could impact our access to capital resources and liquidity in the future, including making credit difficult to obtain or only available on less favorable terms. The COVID-19 pandemic may continue to have an impact on our operations, which could be material. For example, many of our facilities have experienced absenteeism caused by illness or quarantine measures. The continuing impact on our business operations could include, but are not limited to, significant numbers of employees contracting COVID-19; facility closures as a result of state and local ""shelter-in-place"" orders, safety precautions, employee illness, or self-quarantine measures; reductions in our operating effectiveness as our 10Table of Contentsemployees work from home or as a result of new workplace safety measures; unavailability of key personnel necessary to conduct our business activities; project delays; and supply chain or distribution interruptions and constraints. Additionally, we rely on original equipment manufacturers, dealers, and distributors to market and sell most of our products, and effects on their businesses or financial condition as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could result in various adverse operational impacts including, but not limited to, lower sales, delayed cash payments, interrupted customer warranty service, and increased credit risk.Our efforts to manage, mitigate, and remedy these impacts may prove unsuccessful as the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of the pandemic, public safety actions taken by government authorities, long-term economic recovery, and resulting consumer response.Successfully managing our manufacturing activity is critical to our operating and financial results.Over the past several years, we have made strategic capital investments in capacity expansion activities to successfully capture growth opportunities and enhance product offerings, including expansions at Mercury Marine in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin and Boston Whaler in Edgewater, Florida. We also continue to implement manufacturing efficiency enhancements that are important to our success. Conversely, we may make decisions to reduce our manufacturing footprint in accordance with our business strategy. We must carefully manage these capital improvement projects, expansions, efficiency enhancements, and any consolidation efforts to ensure they meet cost targets, comply with applicable environmental, safety, and other regulations, and uphold high-quality workmanship.Moving production to a different plant, expanding capacity at an existing facility, or ceasing production at a facility involves risks, including difficulties initiating production within the cost and timeframe estimated, supplying product to customers when expected, integrating new products, and attracting sufficient skilled workers to handle additional production demands. If we fail to meet these objectives, it could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand for products and increase the cost of production versus projections, both of which could result in a significant adverse impact on operating and financial results. Additionally, plant consolidation or expansion can result in manufacturing inefficiencies, additional expenses, including higher wages or severance costs, and cost inefficiencies, which could negatively impact financial results.Adverse weather conditions and climate change events can have a negative effect on revenues.Changes in seasonal weather conditions can have a significant effect on our operating and financial results. Sales of our marine products are typically stronger just before and during spring and summer, and favorable weather during these months generally has had a positive effect on consumer demand. Conversely, unseasonably cool weather, excessive rainfall, or drought conditions during these periods can reduce or change the timing of demand. Climate change could have an impact on longer-term natural weather trends, resulting in environmental changes including, but not limited to, increases in severe weather, changing sea levels, changes in sea, land and air temperatures, poor water conditions, or reduced access to water, could disrupt or negatively affect our business. Catastrophic events, including natural and environmental disasters, acts of terrorism, or civil unrest, could have a negative effect on our operations and financial results.Hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, storms, and catastrophic natural or environmental disasters, as well as acts of terrorism or civil unrest, could disrupt our distribution channel, operations, or supply chain and decrease consumer demand. If a catastrophic event takes place in one of our major sales markets, our sales could be diminished. Additionally, if such an event occurs near our business locations, manufacturing facilities or key supplier facilities, business operations, and/or operating systems could be interrupted. We could be uniquely affected by weather-related catastrophic events due to the location of certain of our boat facilities in coastal Florida and the size of the manufacturing operation in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin.A significant portion of our revenue is derived from international sources, which creates additional uncertainty.We intend to continue to expand our international operations and customer base as part of our growth strategy. Sales outside the United States, especially in emerging markets, are subject to various risks, including government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions, foreign currency effects, tariffs, customs duties, inflation, difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems, compliance with international laws, treaties, and regulations, and unexpected changes in regulatory environments, disruptions in distribution, dependence on foreign personnel and unions, economic and social instability, and public health crises, including the outbreak of pandemic or contagious disease, such as 11Table of ContentsCOVID-19. In addition, there may be tax inefficiencies in repatriating cash from non-U.S. subsidiaries, or tax laws that affect this process may change.  Instability, including, but not limited to, political events, civil unrest, and an increase in criminal activity, in locations where we maintain a significant presence could adversely impact our manufacturing and business operations. Decreased stability poses a risk of business interruption and delays in shipments of materials, components, and finished goods, as well as a risk of decreased local retail demand for our products.  The decision of the United Kingdom (UK) to exit from the European Union (EU) (Brexit) could cause disruptions to, and create uncertainty surrounding, our business, which could affect our relationships with existing and potential customers. In addition, new rules in place in January 2021 in response to the December 2020 agreement reached between the EU and UK could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations, as the UK determines which EU laws to replace or replicate. We cannot predict what consequences Brexit may have on regulations applicable to our business or on our future operations.In addition, political and economic uncertainty and shifts pose risks of volatility in other global markets, which could affect our operations and financial results. Changes in U.S. policy regarding foreign trade or manufacturing may create negative sentiment about the U.S. among non-U.S. customers, employees, or prospective employees, which could adversely affect our business, sales, hiring, and employee retention. If we continue to expand our business globally, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks, which could materially impact international operations or the business as a whole.Our ability to remain competitive depends on successfully introducing new products and services that meet customer expectations.We believe that our customers look for and expect quality, innovation, and advanced features when evaluating and making purchasing decisions about products and services in the marketplace. Our ability to remain competitive and meet our growth objectives may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development, such as an inability to develop viable new products or customer solutions, gain market acceptance of new products, generate sufficient capital to fund new product development, or obtain adequate intellectual property protection for new products. To meet ever-changing consumer demands, both timing of market entry and pricing of new products are critical. As a result, we may not be able to introduce new products that are necessary to remain competitive in all markets that we serve. Furthermore, we must continue to meet or exceed customers' expectations regarding product quality and after-sales service or our operating results could suffer.Our ability to meet demand in a rapidly changing environment may adversely affect our results of operations.Production and sales levels throughout 2020 fluctuated due in large part to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although we have remained focused on applying and enhancing our COVID-19 health and safety protocols while continuing to ramp-up global production, our businesses may experience difficulty in adapting to the rapidly changing production and sales volumes. We may not be able to recruit or maintain sufficient skilled labor or our suppliers may not be able to deliver sufficient quantities of parts and components for us to match production with rapid changes in forecasted demand. In addition, consumers may pursue other recreational activities if dealer pipeline inventories fall too low and it is not convenient to purchase our products, consumers may purchase from competitors, or our fixed costs may grow in response to increased demand. A failure to adjust dealer pipeline inventory levels to meet demand could adversely impact our results of operations.Loss of key customers could harm our business.In each segment, we have important relationships with key customers, including White River Marine Group, LLC and MarineMax, Inc. From time to time, contracts with these customers come up for renewal. We cannot be certain we will renew such contracts, or renew them on favorable terms. If we lose a key customer, or a significant portion of its business, we could be adversely affected. In addition, certain customers could try to negotiate more favorable pricing of our products, which could depress earnings. In an effort to mitigate the risk associated with reliance on key customer accounts, we continually monitor such relationships and maintain a complete and competitive product lineup. Our financial results may be adversely affected by our third party suppliers' increased costs or inability to meet required production levels due to increased demand or disruption of supply of raw materials, parts, and product components.We rely on third parties to supply raw materials used in the manufacturing process, including oil, aluminum, copper, steel, and resins, as well as product parts and components. The prices for these raw materials, parts, and components fluctuate 12Table of Contentsdepending on market conditions and, in some instances, commodity prices or trade policies, including tariffs. Substantial increases in the prices of raw materials, parts, and components would increase our operating costs, and could reduce our profitability if we are unable to recoup the increased costs through higher product prices or improved operating efficiencies. Similarly, if a critical supplier were to close its operations, cease manufacturing, or otherwise fail to deliver an essential component necessary to our manufacturing operations, that could detrimentally affect our ability to manufacture and sell our products, resulting in an interruption in business operations and/or a loss of sales. In addition, some components used in our manufacturing processes, including certain engine components, furniture, upholstery, and boat windshields, are available from a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers. Operational and financial difficulties that these or other suppliers may face in the future could adversely affect their ability to supply us with the parts and components we need, which could significantly disrupt our operations. It may be difficult to find a replacement supplier for a limited or sole source raw material, part, or component without significant delay or on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, an uncorrected defect or supplier's variation in a raw material, part, or component, either unknown to us or incompatible with our manufacturing process, could jeopardize our ability to manufacture products.  Some additional supply risks that could disrupt our operations, impair our ability to deliver products to customers, and negatively affect our financial results include: •an outbreak of disease or facility closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic, or similar public health threat;•a deterioration of our relationships with suppliers;•events such as natural disasters, power outages, or labor strikes; •financial pressures on our suppliers due to a weakening economy or unfavorable conditions in other end markets; •supplier manufacturing constraints and investment requirements; or•disruption at major global ports and shipping hubs.These risks are exacerbated in the case of single-source suppliers, and the exclusive supplier of a key component could potentially exert significant bargaining power over price, quality, warranty claims, or other terms.We continue to increase production; consequently, our need for raw materials and supplies continues to increase. Our suppliers must be prepared to ramp-up operations and, in many cases, hire additional workers and/or expand capacity in order to fulfill our orders and those of other customers. Cost increases, defects, or sustained interruptions in the supply of raw materials, parts, or components due to delayed start-up periods our suppliers experience as they increase production efforts create risks to our operations and financial results. The Company experienced periodic supply shortages and increases in costs to certain materials in 2020. We continue to address these issues by identifying alternative suppliers for key materials and components, working to secure adequate inventories of critical supplies, and continually monitoring the capabilities of our supplier base. In the future, however, we may experience shortages, delayed delivery, and/or increased prices for key materials, parts, and supplies that are essential to our manufacturing operations.We have a fixed cost base that can affect our profitability if demand decreases.The fixed cost levels of operating production facilities can put pressure on profit margins when sales and production decline. We have maintained discipline over our fixed cost base, and improvements in gross margin can help mitigate the risks related to a fixed cost base. However, our profitability is dependent, in part, on our ability to absorb fixed costs over an increasing number of products sold and shipped. Decreased demand or the need to reduce inventories can lower our production levels and impact our ability to absorb fixed costs, consequently materially impacting our results.Some of our operations are conducted by joint ventures that are not operated solely for our benefit.We share ownership and management responsibilities with jointly owned companies such as BAC and Tohatsu Marine Corporation. These joint ventures may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities, or resources as the Company because they are intended to be operated for the benefit of all co-owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. If such a conflict occurred, it could negatively impact our sales or financial results. RISKS RELATED TO OUR STRATEGIC PLANSFailure to successfully implement our strategic plan and growth initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.13Table of ContentsOur ability to continue generating strong cash flow and profits depends partly on the sustained successful execution of our strategic plan and growth initiatives, including optimizing our business and product portfolio, making acquisitions, improving operating efficiency, and expanding into new adjacent markets. To address risks associated with our plan and growth initiatives, we have established processes to regularly review, manage, and modify our plans, and we believe we have appropriate oversight to monitor initiatives and their impact. However, our strategic plan and growth initiatives may require significant investment and management attention, which could result in the diversion of these resources from the core business and other business issues and opportunities. Additionally, any new initiative is subject to certain risks, including customer acceptance, competition, the ability to manufacture products on schedule and to specification, the ability to create the necessary supply chain, and/or the ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel. There is no assurance that we will be able to develop and successfully implement our strategic plan and growth initiatives in a manner that fully achieves our strategic objectives.Our business and operations are dependent on the expertise of our key contributors, our successful implementation of succession plans, and our ability to attract and retain management employees and skilled labor.The talents and efforts of our employees, particularly key managers, are vital to our success. Our management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace. We may be unable to retain them or to attract other highly qualified employees. Failure to hire, develop, and retain highly qualified and diverse employee talent and to develop and implement an adequate succession plan for the management team could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and our future success. During 2020, we added several new members to our senior leadership team, including our Chief Financial Officer, President of the Boat Group, President of the Advanced Systems Group, Vice President - Enterprise Technologies, and Chief Information Officer. We perform an annual review of management succession plans with the Board of Directors, including reviewing executive officer and other important positions to substantially mitigate the risk associated with key contributor transitions, but we cannot ensure that all transitions will be implemented successfully.Our ability to continue to execute our growth strategy could potentially be adversely affected by the effectiveness of organizational changes. Any disruption or uncertainty resulting from such changes could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Much of our future success depends on, among other factors, our ability to attract and retain skilled labor. In 2020, nearly all facilities sought to increase production and to hire and retain sufficient skilled hourly labor to meet increased demand for our products. In the future, if we are not successful in these efforts, we may be unable to meet our operating goals and plans, which may impact our financial results. We continually invest in automation and improve our efficiency, but availability and retention of skilled hourly workers remains critical to our operations. In order to manage this risk, we regularly monitor and make improvements to wages and benefit programs, as well as develop and improve recruiting, training, and safety programs to attract and retain an experienced and skilled workforce. An inability to identify and complete targeted acquisitions could negatively impact financial results.Our growth initiatives include making strategic acquisitions, which depend on the availability of suitable targets at acceptable terms and our ability to complete the transactions. In managing our acquisition strategy, we conduct rigorous due diligence, involve various functions, and continually review target acquisitions, all of which we believe mitigates some of our acquisition risks. However, we cannot assure that suitable acquisitions will be identified or consummated or that, if consummated, they will be successful. Acquisitions include a number of risks, including our ability to project and evaluate market demand, realize potential synergies and cost savings, and make accurate accounting estimates, as well as diversion of management attention. Uncertainties exist in assessing the value, risks, profitability, and liabilities associated with certain businesses or assets, negotiating acceptable terms, obtaining financing on acceptable terms, and receiving any necessary regulatory approvals. As we continue to grow, in part, through acquisitions, our success depends on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these risks. Our failure to successfully do so could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.The inability to successfully integrate acquisitions could negatively impact financial results.Our strategic acquisitions pose risks, such as our ability to project and evaluate market demand; maximize potential synergies and cost savings; make accurate accounting estimates; and achieve anticipated business objectives. Our recent acquisitions of Power Products and Freedom Boat Club, and other acquisitions we may complete in the future, present these and other integration risks, including:14Table of Contents•disruptions in core, adjacent, or acquired businesses that could make it more difficult to maintain business and operational relationships, including customer and supplier relationships;•the possibility that the expected synergies and value creation will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time period; •the risk that unexpected costs and liabilities will be incurred;•diversion of management attention; and•difficulties retaining employees.  If we fail to timely and successfully integrate new businesses into existing operations, we may see higher costs, lost sales, or otherwise diminished earnings and financial results. There can be no assurance that strategic divestitures or restructurings will provide business benefits.As part of our strategy, we continuously evaluate our portfolio of businesses to further maximize shareholder value. In recent years, we have divested our Fitness and Bowling businesses and restructured our Sea Ray business to remove Sport Yachts and Yachts from the portfolio. We have previously and may in the future make other changes to our portfolio, and the changes may be material. Divestitures involve risks, including difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products, and personnel, disruption in our operations or businesses, finding a suitable purchaser, the diversion of management's attention from our other businesses, the potential loss of key employees, adverse effects on relationships with our dealer or supplier partners or their businesses, the erosion of employee morale or customer confidence, and the retention of contingent liabilities related to the divested business. If we do not successfully manage the risks associated with divestitures, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected as the potential strategic benefits may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected. RISKS RELATED TO OUR DEALERS, DISTRIBUTORS, AND FRANCHISEESOur financial results could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective distribution.We rely on third-party dealers and distributors to sell most of our products. Maintaining a reliable network of dealers is essential to our success. We face competition from other manufacturers in attracting and retaining distributors and independent boat dealers. A significant deterioration in the number or effectiveness of our dealers and distributors could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.Although at present we believe dealer health to be generally favorable, weakening demand for marine products could hurt our dealers’ financial performance. In particular, reduced cash flow from decreases in sales and tightening credit markets could impair dealers' ability to fund operations. Inability to fund operations can force dealers to cease business, and we may be unable to obtain alternate distribution in the vacated market. An inability to obtain alternate distribution could unfavorably affect our net sales through reduced market presence. If economic conditions deteriorate, we anticipate that dealer failures or voluntary market exits would increase, especially if overall retail demand materially declines. Dealer or distributor inability to secure adequate access to capital could adversely affect our sales.Our dealers require adequate liquidity to finance their operations, including purchasing our products. Dealers are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could unfavorably affect their liquidity positions, including, among other things, continued access to adequate financing sources on a timely basis on reasonable terms. These financing sources are vital to our ability to sell products through our distribution network, particularly to boat and engine dealers. Entities affiliated with Wells Fargo & Company, including BAC, the Company’s 49 percent owned joint venture, finance a significant portion of our boat and engine sales to dealers through floorplan financing to marine dealers. Many factors continue to influence the availability and terms of financing that our dealer floorplan financing providers offer, including: •their ability to access certain capital markets, such as the securitization and the commercial paper markets, and to fund their operations in a cost effective manner; •the performance of their overall credit portfolios; •their willingness to accept the risks associated with lending to marine dealers; •the overall creditworthiness of those dealers; and•the overall aging and level of pipeline inventories. 15Table of ContentsOur sales could be adversely affected if financing terms change unfavorably or if BAC were to be terminated. This could require dealers to find alternative sources of financing, including our direct financing to dealers, which could require additional capital to fund the associated receivables.We may be required to repurchase inventory or accounts of certain dealers.We have agreements with certain third-party finance companies to provide financing to our customers, enabling them to purchase our products. In connection with these agreements, we may either have obligations to repurchase our products from the finance company or have recourse obligations. These obligations may be triggered if our dealers default on their payment or other obligations to the finance companies.Our maximum contingent obligation to repurchase inventory and our maximum contingent recourse obligations on customer receivables are less than the total balances of dealer financings outstanding under these programs, because our obligations under certain of these arrangements are subject to caps, or are limited based on the age of product. Our risk related to these arrangements is partially mitigated by the proceeds we receive on the resale of repurchased product to other dealers, or by recoveries on receivables purchased under the recourse obligations.Our inventory repurchase obligations relate primarily to the inventory floorplan credit facilities of our boat and engine dealers. Our actual historical repurchase experience related to these arrangements has been substantially less than our maximum contractual obligations. If dealers default on their obligations, file for bankruptcy, or cease operations, however, we could incur losses associated with the repurchase of our products. In addition, our net sales and earnings may be unfavorably affected due to reduced market coverage and an associated decline in sales.Future declines in marine industry demand could cause an increase in repurchase activity, or could require us to incur losses in excess of established reserves. In addition, our cash flow and loss experience could be adversely affected if repurchased inventory is not successfully distributed to other dealers in a timely manner, or if the recovery rate on the resale of the product declines. The finance companies could require changes in repurchase or recourse terms that would result in an increase in our contractual contingent obligations.Inventory reductions by major dealers, retailers, and independent boat builders could adversely affect our financial results.If demand begins to trail forecasted levels or if new product introductions are expected to replace existing products, the Company and our dealers, retailers, and other distributors could decide to reduce the number of units they hold. These actions could result in wholesale sales reductions in excess of retail sales reductions and would likely result in lower production levels of certain of our products, potentially causing lower rates of absorption of fixed costs in our manufacturing facilities and lower margins. While we have processes in place to help manage dealer inventories at appropriate levels, potential inventory reductions remain a risk to our future sales and results of operations.The franchise business model of Freedom Boat Club presents risks.Our franchisees are an integral part of our Freedom Boat Club business and its growth strategies. We may be unable to successfully implement the growth strategies if our franchisees do not participate in the implementation of those strategies or if we are unable to attract a sufficient number of qualified franchisees. While our franchisees are required to comply with our franchise and related agreements, our franchisees are independent and manage their boat clubs as independent businesses, responsible for all day-to-day operations of their boat clubs. If these franchisees fail to maintain or act in accordance with applicable brand standards; experience service, safety, or other operational problems, including any data breach involving club member information; or project a brand image inconsistent with ours, our image and reputation could suffer, which in turn could hurt our business and operating results.RISKS RELATED TO CYBERSECURITY AND TECHNOLOGYOur business operations could be negatively impacted by an outage or breach of our information technology systems, operational technology systems, or a cybersecurity event.We manage our global business operations through a variety of information technology (IT) and operational technology systems which we continually enhance to increase efficiency and security. We depend on these systems for commercial transactions, customer interactions, manufacturing, branding, employee tracking, and other applications. Some of the systems are based on legacy technology and operate with a minimal level of available support, and recent acquisitions using other 16Table of Contentssystems have added to the complexity of our IT infrastructure. New system implementations across the enterprise also pose risks of outages or disruptions, which could affect our suppliers, commercial operations, and customers. We continue to upgrade, streamline, and integrate these systems and have invested in strategies to prevent a failure or breach but, like those of other companies, our systems are susceptible to outages due to natural disasters, power loss, computer viruses, security breaches, hardware or software vulnerabilities, disruptions, and similar events. If a legacy system or another of the Company's key systems were to fail or if our IT systems were unable to communicate effectively, this could result in missed or delayed sales or lost opportunities for cost reduction or efficient cash management.  We exchange information with many trading partners across all aspects of our commercial operations through our IT systems. A breakdown, outage, malicious intrusion, breach, random attack, or other disruption of communications could result in erroneous or fraudulent transactions, disclosure of confidential information, loss of reputation and confidence, and may also result in legal claims or proceedings, penalties, and remediation costs. We have numerous e-commerce and e-marketing portals and our systems may contain personal information of customers or employees; therefore, we must continue to be diligent in protecting against malicious cyber attacks. We have been the target of attempted cyber attacks and other security threats and we may be subject to breaches of our IT systems. We have programs in place that are intended to detect, contain, and respond to data security incidents and that provide employee awareness training regarding phishing, malware, and other cyber risks. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. If our security measures are breached or fail, unauthorized persons may be able to obtain access to or acquire personal or other confidential data. Depending on the nature of the information compromised, we may also have obligations to notify consumers and/or employees about the incident, and we may need to provide some form of remedy, such as a subscription to a credit monitoring service, for the individuals affected by the incident. This could negatively affect our relationships with customers or trading partners, lead to potential claims against the Company, and damage our image and reputation.We rely on third parties for computing, storage, processing, and similar services. Any disruption of or interference with our use of these third-party services could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.Most of our business systems reside on third-party outsourced cloud infrastructure providers. We are therefore vulnerable to service interruptions experienced by these providers and could experience interruptions, delays, or outages in service availability in the future due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human, hardware or software errors, hosting disruptions, and capacity constraints. While we have mitigation and service redundancy plans in place, outages and/or capacity constraints could still arise from a number of causes such as technical failures, natural disasters, fraud, or internal or third-party security attacks, which could negatively impact our ability to manufacture and/or operate our business.  We collect, store, process, share, and use personal information, and rely on third parties that are not directly under our control to do so as well, which subjects us to legal obligations, laws and regulations related to security and privacy, and any actual or perceived failure to meet those obligations could harm our business.We are subject to various data protection and privacy laws and regulations in the countries where we operate because we collect, store, process, share, and use personal information, and we rely on third parties that are not directly under our control to do so as well. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union (EU) went into effect in May 2018 and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) became effective January 1, 2020. Although we have implemented plans to comply with these laws, GDPR, CCPA, and future laws and regulations could impose an even greater compliance burden and risk with respect to privacy and data security than prior laws. The EU (through the GDPR) and a growing number of legislative and regulatory bodies elsewhere in the world have adopted consumer notification requirements in the event of unauthorized access to or acquisition of certain types of personal information. These breach notification laws continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. Complying with these obligations could cause us to incur substantial costs, require significant management time and attention, and increase negative publicity surrounding any incident that compromises personal information. RISKS RELATED TO OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTYOur success depends upon the continued strength of our brands.We believe that our brands, particularly including Mercury Marine, Sea Ray, Boston Whaler, and Lund, significantly contribute to our success, and that maintaining and enhancing these brands is important to expanding our customer base. A failure to adequately promote, protect, and strengthen our brands could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Further, in connection with the divestiture of the bowling and billiards businesses, we licensed certain trademarks and 17Table of Contentsservicemarks, including use of the name ""Brunswick,"" to the acquiring companies. Our reputation may be adversely affected by the purchasers' inappropriate use of the marks or of the name Brunswick, including potential negative publicity, loss of confidence, or other damage to our image due to this licensed use.  Either inadequate intellectual property protection that could allow others to use our technologies and impair our ability to compete, or failure to successfully defend against patent infringement claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.We regard much of the technology underlying our products as proprietary. We rely on a combination of patents, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws; employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements; and other contracts to establish and protect our technology and other intellectual property rights. However, we remain subject to risks, including:•the steps we take to protect our proprietary technology may be inadequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology;•third parties may independently develop similar technology;•agreements containing protections may be breached or terminated;•we may not have adequate remedies for breaches; •existing patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws may afford limited protection;•a third party could copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization; or•we may be required to litigate to enforce our intellectual property rights, and we may not be successful.Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult, particularly outside the U.S., and litigating intellectual property claims may result in substantial cost and divert management’s attention.  In addition, we may be required to defend our products against patent or other intellectual property infringement claims or litigation. Besides defense expenses and costs, we may not prevail in such cases, forcing us to seek licenses or royalty arrangements from third parties, which we may not be able to obtain on reasonable terms, or subjecting us to an order or requirement to stop manufacturing, using, selling, or distributing products that included challenged intellectual property, which could harm our business and financial results.RISKS RELATED TO OUR REGULATORY, ACCOUNTING, LEGAL, AND TAX ENVIRONMENTChanges to U.S. trade policy, tariffs, and import/export regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Changes in laws and policies governing foreign trade, which may occur under a new U.S. presidential administration, could adversely affect our business and trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries. Although we were granted exclusion from Section 301 tariffs for Mercury Marine 40, 50, and 60 horsepower engines through the end of 2019, these exclusions were not renewed for 2020 and the denial of exemption requests have and may continue to negatively affect our business. We continue to be subject to meaningful tariffs, and there is no assurance that we will be granted exclusions in the future. Like many other multinational corporations, we do a significant amount of business that would be affected by changes to the trade policies of the U.S. and foreign countries (including governmental action related to tariffs and international trade agreements). Such changes have the potential to adversely impact the U.S. economy, our industry, our suppliers, and global demand for our products and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill, trade names, and other long-lived assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth.Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as our trade names, are recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition and are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. In evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill and trade names, we make assumptions regarding future operating performance, business trends, and market and economic conditions. Such analyses further require us to make certain assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates, and discount rates. Uncertainties are inherent in evaluating and applying these factors to the assessment of goodwill and trade name recoverability. We could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill or trade names prior to the annual assessment if we experience business disruptions, unexpected significant declines in operating results, a divestiture of a significant component of our business, or declines in market capitalization.18Table of ContentsWe also continually evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of our definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets may warrant revision or whether the remaining balance of such assets may not be recoverable. We use an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flow over the remaining life of the asset in measuring whether the asset is recoverable.As of December 31, 2020, the balance of total goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets was $584 million, which represents approximately 15 percent of total assets. If the future operating performance of either the Company or individual operating segments is not sufficient, we could be required to record non-cash impairment charges. Impairment charges could substantially affect our reported earnings in the periods such charges are recorded. In addition, impairment charges could indicate a reduction in business value which could limit our ability to obtain adequate financing in the future.  We manufacture and sell products that create exposure to potential claims and litigation.Our manufacturing operations and the products we produce could result in product quality, warranty, personal injury, property damage, and other issues, thereby increasing the risk of litigation and potential liability, as well as regulatory fines. To manage this risk, we have established a global, enterprise-wide program charged with the responsibility for reviewing, addressing, and reporting on product integrity issues. Historically, the resolution of such claims has not had a materially adverse effect on our business, and we maintain what we believe to be adequate insurance coverage to mitigate a portion of these risks. However, we may experience material losses in the future, incur significant costs to defend claims or issue product recalls, experience claims in excess of our insurance coverage or that are not covered by insurance, or be subjected to fines or penalties. Our reputation may be adversely affected by such claims, whether or not successful, including potential negative publicity about our products. We record accruals for known potential liabilities, but there is the possibility that actual losses may exceed these accruals and therefore negatively impact earnings.Compliance with environmental, health, safety, zoning, and other laws and regulations may increase costs and reduce demand for our products.We are subject to federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, including product safety, environmental, health and safety, and other regulations. While we believe that we maintain the requisite licenses and permits and that we are in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations, a failure to satisfy these and other regulatory requirements could result in fines or penalties, and compliance could increase the cost of operations. The adoption of additional laws, rules, and regulations, including stricter emissions standards, could increase our manufacturing costs, require additional product development investment, increase consumer pricing, and reduce consumer demand for our products or boat club operations.  Environmental restrictions, boat plant emission restrictions, and permitting and zoning requirements can limit production capacity, access to water for boating and marinas, and storage space. While future licensing requirements, including any licenses imposed on recreational boating, are not expected to be unduly restrictive, they may deter potential customers, thereby reducing our sales. Furthermore, regulations allowing the sale of fuel containing higher levels of ethanol for automobiles, which is not appropriate or intended for use in marine engines, may nonetheless result in increased warranty, service costs, customer dissatisfaction with products, and other claims against the Company if boaters mistakenly use this fuel in marine engines, causing damage to and the degradation of components in their marine engines. Many of our customers use our products for fishing and related recreational activities. Regulatory or commercial policies and practices impacting access to water, including availability of slip locations and/or the ability to transfer boats among different waterways, access to fisheries, or the ability to fish in some areas could negatively affect demand for our products.Our manufacturing processes involve the use, handling, storage, and contracting for recycling or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes. Accordingly, we are subject to regulations regarding these substances, and the misuse or mishandling of such substances could expose us to liabilities, including claims for property, personal injury, or natural resources damages, or fines. We are also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property, including cleanup efforts currently underway. If a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from one of our current or former properties or another location where we have disposed of hazardous materials, we may be held liable for the contamination, regardless of knowledge or whether we were at fault, and the amount of such liability could be material.Additionally, we are subject to laws governing our relationships with employees, including, but not limited to, employment obligations as a federal contractor and employee wage, hour, and benefits issues, such as health care benefits. Compliance with these rules and regulations, and compliance with any changes to current regulations, could increase the cost of our operations.Changes in income tax laws or enforcement could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.19Table of ContentsThe US federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), signed into law on December 22, 2017, continues to have an overall positive impact on our financial statements, but certain expiring tax provisions (e.g., research and development and tangible property immediate expensing), administrative, and legislative changes that may result from the recent U.S. general elections as well as new or amended government regulations or guidance could have a negative impact. In addition, other changes in international and domestic tax laws, including developments at the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development that may change global taxing norms, and changes in tax law enforcement, could negatively impact our tax provision, cash flows, and/or tax related balance sheet amounts, including our deferred tax asset values. Changes in U.S. and international tax laws may have broader implications, including impacts on the economy, currency markets, inflation, consumer behavior, and competitive dynamics, which are difficult to predict, and may positively or negatively impact the Company and our results.RISKS RELATED TO OUR COMMON STOCKThe timing and amount of our share repurchases are subject to a number of uncertainties.The Board of Directors has authorized the Company’s discretionary repurchase of outstanding common stock, to be systematically completed in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. In 2020, we repurchased $118 million of shares, and we plan to continue share repurchases in 2021 and beyond. The amount and timing of share repurchases are based on a variety of factors. Important considerations that could cause us to limit, suspend, or delay future stock repurchases include:•unfavorable market and economic conditions;•the trading price of our common stock;•the nature and magnitude of other investment opportunities available to us from time to time; and•the availability of cash.  Delaying, limiting, or suspending our stock repurchase program may negatively affect performance versus earnings per share targets, and ultimately our stock price.Certain activist shareholder actions could cause us to incur expense and hinder execution of our strategy.We actively engage in discussions with our shareholders regarding further strengthening our Company and creating long-term shareholder value. This ongoing dialogue can include certain divisive activist tactics, which can take many forms. Some shareholder activism, including potential proxy contests, could result in substantial costs, such as legal fees and expenses, and divert management’s and our Board’s attention and resources from our businesses and strategic plans. Additionally, public shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future, adversely affect our relationships with dealers, distributors, or customers, make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, and cause our stock price to fluctuate based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business. These risks could adversely affect our business and operating results"
10,BC,BRUNSWICK CORP,2020-02-18,"  Risk Factors
The Company's operations and financial results are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including those described below, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock.Worldwide economic conditions significantly affect our industries and businesses, and economic decline can materially impact our financial results.In times of economic uncertainty and contraction, consumers tend to have less discretionary income and to defer expenditures for discretionary items, which adversely affects our financial performance.  Although we have expanded the portions of our portfolio that are dependent or substantially weighted toward the usage and maintenance of boats and engines versus the sale of new product and therefore less susceptible to economic cycles, a portion of the business remains cyclical and sensitive to personal spending levels. Deterioration in general economic conditions that in turn diminishes consumer confidence or discretionary income may reduce our sales, or we may decide to lower pricing for our products, thus adversely affecting our financial results, including increasing the potential for future impairment charges. Further, most of our products are used for recreation, and consumers’ limited discretionary income in times of economic hardship may be diverted to other activities that occupy their time, such as other forms of recreation, religious, cultural, or community activities.  We cannot predict the timing or continued strength of global economies, either worldwide or in the specific markets in which we compete.  Failure to successfully implement our strategic plan and growth initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.Our ability to continue generating strong cash flow and profits depends partly on the sustained successful execution of our strategic plan and growth initiatives, including optimizing our business and product portfolio, making acquisitions, improving operating efficiency, and expanding into new adjacent markets and customers. To address risks associated with our plan and growth initiatives, we have established processes to regularly review, manage, and modify our plans, and we believe we have appropriate oversight to monitor initiatives and their impact. However, our strategic plan and growth initiatives may require significant capital investment and management attention, which could result in the diversion of these resources from the core business and other business issues and opportunities. Additionally, any new initiative is subject to certain risks, including customer acceptance, competition, the ability to manufacture products on schedule and to specification, the ability to create the necessary supply chain, and/or the ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel.  There is no assurance that we will be able to develop and successfully implement our strategic plan and growth initiatives in a manner that fully achieves our strategic objectives.Successfully managing our manufacturing activity is critical to our operating and financial results.Over the past several years, we have made strategic capital investments in capacity expansion activities to successfully capture growth opportunities and enhance product offerings, including expansions at Mercury Marine in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin and Boston Whaler in Edgewater, Florida. We may also make decisions to reduce our manufacturing footprint in accordance with our business strategy. We have also implemented, or are in the process of implementing, several manufacturing efficiency enhancements that are important to our success.  We must carefully manage these capital improvement projects, expansions, efficiency enhancements, and any manufacturing consolidation efforts to ensure they meet cost targets, comply with applicable environmental, safety, and other regulations, and uphold high-quality workmanship.Moving production to a different plant, expanding capacity at an existing facility, or ceasing production at a facility involves risks, including difficulties initiating production within the cost and timeframe estimated, supplying product to customers when expected, integrating new products, and attracting sufficient skilled workers to handle additional production demands. If we fail to meet these objectives, it could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand for products and increase the cost of production versus projections, both of which could result in a significant adverse impact on operating and financial results.  Additionally, plant consolidation or expansion can result in manufacturing inefficiencies, additional expenses, including higher wages or severance costs, and cost inefficiencies, which could exceed projections and negatively impact financial results.Changes to U.S. trade policy, tariffs, and import/export regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Changes in laws and policies governing foreign trade could continue to adversely affect our business. As a result of recent policy changes, there may be greater restrictions and economic disincentives on international trade. The new tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, and certain foreign governments have instituted 8Table of Contentsor are considering imposing trade sanctions on certain U.S. goods, such as aluminum and steel. Although we were granted exclusion from Section 301 tariffs for Mercury Marine 40, 50, and 60 horsepower engines in 2018 effective through the end of 2019, these exclusions were not renewed for 2020 and the denial of exemption requests will negatively affect our business.  We continue to be subject to meaningful other tariffs, and there is no assurance that we will be granted similar exclusions for these or other products in the future, or that we will not be subject to additional tariffs. Like many other multinational corporations, we do a significant amount of business that would be affected by changes to the trade policies of the U.S. and foreign countries (including governmental action related to tariffs and international trade agreements). Such changes have the potential to adversely impact the U.S. economy, our industry, and global demand for our products and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Changes in currency exchange rates can adversely affect our results.Some of our sales are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. Consequently, a strong U.S. dollar may adversely affect reported revenues and our profitability. We have hedging programs in place to reduce our risk to currency fluctuations; however, we cannot hedge against all currency risks, especially over the long term. We maintain a portion of our cost structure in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which partially mitigates the impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar. This includes manufacturing operations for boats in Europe and Canada, and smaller outboard engines manufactured in China and purchased from our joint venture in Japan.  We also continue to evaluate the supply chain and cost structure for opportunities to further mitigate foreign currency risks.  We sell products manufactured in the U.S. into certain international markets in U.S. dollars, including to Canada, Europe, and Latin America. Demand for our products in these markets may be diminished by a strengthening U.S. dollar, or we may need to lower prices to remain competitive. Some of our competitors with cost positions based outside the U.S., including Asian-based outboard engine manufacturers and European-based large fiberglass boat manufacturers, may have an improved cost position due to a strengthening U.S. dollar, which could result in pricing pressures on our products. Although these factors have existed for several years, we do not believe they have had a material adverse effect on our competitive position.Our success depends upon the continued strength of our brands.We believe that our brands, particularly including Mercury Marine, Sea Ray, Boston Whaler, and Lund significantly contribute to our success, and that maintaining and enhancing these brands is important to expanding our customer base. A failure to adequately promote, protect, and strengthen our brands could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Further, in connection with the divestiture of the bowling and billiards businesses, we licensed certain trademarks and servicemarks, including use of the name “Brunswick,” to the acquiring companies. Our reputation may be adversely affected by the purchasers' inappropriate use of the marks or of the name Brunswick, including potential negative publicity, loss of confidence, or other damage to our image due to this licensed use.   Fiscal concerns and policy changes may negatively impact worldwide economic and credit conditions and adversely affect our industries, businesses, and financial condition.Fiscal policy could have a material adverse impact on worldwide economic conditions, the financial markets, and availability of credit and, consequently, may negatively affect our industries, businesses, and overall financial condition. Customers often finance purchases of our products, particularly boats, and as interest rates rise, the cost of financing the purchase also increases. While credit availability is adequate to support demand and interest rates remain relatively low, there are fewer lenders, tighter underwriting and loan approval criteria, as well as greater down payment requirements than before the global recession. If credit conditions worsen, and adversely affect the ability of customers to finance potential purchases at acceptable terms and interest rates, it could result in a decrease in sales or delay improvement in sales.Dealer or distributor inability to secure adequate access to capital could adversely affect our sales.Our dealers require adequate liquidity to finance their operations, including purchasing our products. Dealers are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could unfavorably affect their liquidity positions, including, among other things, continued access to adequate financing sources on a timely basis on reasonable terms. These financing sources are vital to our ability to sell products through our distribution network, particularly to boat and engine dealers.  Entities affiliated with Wells Fargo & Company, including BAC, the Company’s 49 percent owned joint venture, finance a significant portion of our boat and engine sales to dealers through floorplan financing to marine dealers. 9Table of ContentsMany factors continue to influence the availability and terms of financing that our dealer floorplan financing providers offer, including: •their ability to access certain capital markets, such as the securitization and the commercial paper markets, and to fund their operations in a cost effective manner; •the performance of their overall credit portfolios; •their willingness to accept the risks associated with lending to marine dealers; •the overall creditworthiness of those dealers; and•the overall aging and level of pipeline inventories. Our sales could be adversely affected if financing terms change unfavorably or if BAC were to be terminated. This could require dealers to find alternative sources of financing, including our direct financing to dealers, which could require additional capital to fund the associated receivables.Our financial results could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective distribution.We rely on third-party dealers and distributors to sell most of our products. Maintaining a reliable network of dealers is essential to our success. We face competition from other manufacturers in attracting and retaining distributors and independent boat dealers. A significant deterioration in the number or effectiveness of our dealers and distributors could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.Although at present we believe dealer health to be generally favorable, weakening demand for marine products could hurt our dealers’ financial performance. In particular, reduced cash flow from decreases in sales and tightening credit markets may impair dealers' ability to fund operations. Inability to fund operations can force dealers to cease business, and we may be unable to obtain alternate distribution in the vacated market. An inability to obtain alternate distribution could unfavorably affect our net sales through reduced market presence. If economic conditions deteriorate, we anticipate that dealer failures or voluntary market exits would increase, especially if overall retail demand materially declines. Adverse economic, credit, and capital market conditions could have a negative impact on our financial results.We may rely on short-term capital markets to meet our working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, pay dividends, or fund employee benefit programs and we maintain short-term borrowing facilities that can be used to meet these capital requirements. In addition, over the long term, we may determine that it is necessary to access the capital markets to refinance existing long-term indebtedness or to raise capital for other initiatives.Adverse global economic conditions, market volatility, and regulatory uncertainty could lead to volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. This could adversely affect our ability to access capital and credit markets or increase the cost to do so, which could have a negative impact on our business, financial results and competitive position.In addition, our variable rate indebtedness and financing programs, including wholesale financing arrangements through BAC, may use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the rate. As announced in July 2017, LIBOR is expected to be phased out by the end of 2021. Uncertainty as to the nature of alternative reference rates and as to potential changes or other reforms to LIBOR may adversely impact the availability and cost of borrowings.Adverse weather conditions, climate events, or regulatory policies can have a negative effect on revenues.Changes in seasonal weather conditions can have a significant effect on our operating and financial results. Sales of our marine products are typically stronger just before and during spring and summer, and favorable weather during these months generally has had a positive effect on consumer demand. Conversely, unseasonably cool weather, excessive rainfall, or drought conditions during these periods can reduce or change the timing of demand.  Climate change could have an impact on longer-term natural weather trends, resulting in environmental changes including, but not limited to, increases in severe weather, changing sea levels, changes in sea, land and air temperatures, poor water conditions, or reduced access to water, could disrupt or negatively affect our business.  Many of our customers use our products for fishing and related recreational activities.  Regulatory or commercial policies and practices impacting access to water, including availability of slip locations and/or the ability to transfer boats among different waterways, access to fisheries, or the ability to fish in some areas could negatively affect demand for our products.Catastrophic events, including natural and environmental disasters, could have a negative effect on our operations and financial results.Hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, storms, and catastrophic natural or environmental disasters could disrupt our distribution channel, operations, or supply chain and decrease consumer demand.  If a catastrophic event takes place in one of our major sales 10Table of Contentsmarkets, our sales could be diminished.  Additionally, if such an event occurs near our business locations, manufacturing facilities or key suppliers' facilities, business operations and/or operating systems could be interrupted. We could be uniquely affected by a catastrophic event due to the location of certain of our boat facilities in coastal Florida and the size of the manufacturing operation in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin.Loss of key customers could harm our business.In each segment, we have important relationships with key customers, such as White River Marine Group, LLC and MarineMax, Inc., and, from time to time, contracts with these customers come up for renewal. We cannot be certain we will renew such contracts, or renew them on favorable terms. If we lose a key customer, or a significant portion of its business, we could be adversely affected. In addition, certain customers could try to negotiate more favorable pricing of our products, which could depress earnings. In an effort to mitigate the risk associated with reliance on key customer accounts, we continually monitor such relationships and maintain a complete and competitive product lineup. Our business and operations are dependent on the expertise of our key contributors, our successful implementation of succession plans, and our ability to attract and retain management employees and skilled labor.The talents and efforts of our employees, particularly key managers, are vital to our success. Our management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace. We may be unable to retain them or to attract other highly qualified employees. Failure to hire, develop, and retain highly qualified and diverse employee talent and to develop and implement an adequate succession plan for the management team could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and our future success. Although we cannot ensure that all transitions will be implemented successfully, we perform an annual review of management succession plans with the Board of Directors, including reviewing executive officer and other important positions to substantially mitigate the risk associated with key contributor transitions.In 2019, we reorganized several of our operations and streamlined functions as part of the transformation to a marine-focused enterprise.  Our ability to continue to execute our growth strategy could potentially be adversely affected by the effectiveness of these organizational changes or other, currently unanticipated executive or management changes that may be disruptive to, or cause uncertainty in, our business and future strategic direction. Any such disruption or uncertainty could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. Much of our future success depends on, among other factors, our ability to attract and retain skilled labor. If we are not successful in these efforts, we may be unable to meet our operating goals and plans, which may impact our financial results. We continually invest in automation and improve our efficiency, but with unemployment rates at low levels in many of the geographic areas in which we manufacture or distribute goods, availability of skilled hourly workers remains critical to our operations. In order to manage this risk, we regularly monitor and make improvements to wages and benefit programs, as well as develop and improve recruiting and training programs to attract and retain an experienced and skilled workforce. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from international sources, which creates additional uncertainty.We intend to continue to expand our international operations and customer base as part of our growth strategy. Sales outside the United States, especially in emerging markets, are subject to various risks, including government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions, foreign currency effects, tariffs, customs duties, inflation, difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems, compliance with international laws, treaties, and regulations, and unexpected changes in regulatory environments, disruptions in distribution, and dependence on foreign personnel and unions, economic and social instability, and public health crises, including the outbreak of pandemic or contagious disease, such as the novel coronavirus. In addition, there may be tax inefficiencies in repatriating cash from non-U.S. subsidiaries, or tax laws that affect this process may change.  Instability, including, but not limited to, political events, civil unrest, and an increase in criminal activity, in locations where we maintain a significant presence could adversely impact our manufacturing and business operations. Decreased stability poses a risk of business interruption and delays in shipments of materials, components, and finished goods, as well as a risk of decreased local retail demand for our products.  In addition, global political and economic uncertainty and shifts pose risks of volatility in global markets, which could affect our operations and financial results. Changes in U.S. policy regarding foreign trade or manufacturing may create negative sentiment about the U.S. among non-U.S. customers, employees, or prospective employees, which could adversely affect our business, sales, hiring, and employee retention.  If we continue to expand our business globally, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks, which could materially impact international operations or the business as a whole.11Table of ContentsAdditionally, on January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom (“UK”) officially withdrew from the EU (“Brexit”), subject to a transition period until December 31, 2020, which could be extended up to two years under certain conditions (the “Brexit Transition Period”). There is uncertainty as to the scope, nature and terms of the relationship between the UK and the EU after the Brexit Transition Period. This uncertainty could adversely impact customer and investor confidence, result in additional market volatility, legal uncertainty and divergent national laws and regulations. An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill, trade names, and other long-lived assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth.Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as our trade names, are recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition and are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. In evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill and trade names, we make assumptions regarding future operating performance, business trends, and market and economic conditions. Such analyses further require us to make certain assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates, and discount rates. Uncertainties are inherent in evaluating and applying these factors to the assessment of goodwill and trade name recoverability. We could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill or trade names prior to the annual assessment if we experience business disruptions, unexpected significant declines in operating results, a divestiture of a significant component of our business, or declines in market capitalization.We also continually evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of our definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets may warrant revision or whether the remaining balance of such assets may not be recoverable. We use an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flow over the remaining life of the asset in measuring whether the asset is recoverable.As of December 31, 2019, the balance of total goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets was $580 million, which represents approximately 16 percent of total assets. If the future operating performance of either the Company or individual operating segments is not sufficient, we could be required to record non-cash impairment charges. Impairment charges could substantially affect our reported earnings in the periods such charges are recorded. In addition, impairment charges could indicate a reduction in business value which could limit our ability to obtain adequate financing in the future.  Our business operations could be negatively impacted by an outage or breach of our information technology systems, operational technology systems, or a cybersecurity event.We manage our global business operations through a variety of information technology (IT) and operational technology systems which we continually enhance to increase efficiency and security. We depend on these systems for commercial transactions, customer interactions, manufacturing, branding, employee tracking, and other applications. Some of the systems are based on legacy technology and operate with a minimal level of available support, and recent acquisitions using other systems have added to the complexity of our IT infrastructure. In addition, the Fitness business sale has required the separation of previously unified business and IT systems, and new systems, which process is ongoing. New system implementations across the enterprise also pose risks of outages or disruptions, which could affect our suppliers, commercial operations, and customers. We are working to upgrade, streamline, and integrate these systems and have invested in strategies to prevent a failure or breach but, like those of other companies, our systems are susceptible to outages due to natural disasters, power loss, computer viruses, security breaches, hardware or software vulnerabilities, disruptions, and similar events.  If a legacy system or another of the Company's key systems were to fail or if our IT systems were unable to communicate effectively, this could result in missed or delayed sales or lost opportunities for cost reduction or efficient cash management.  We exchange information with hundreds of trading partners across all aspects of our commercial operations through our IT systems.  A breakdown, outage, malicious intrusion, breach, random attack, or other disruption of communications could result in erroneous or fraudulent transactions, disclosure of confidential information, loss of reputation and confidence, and may also result in legal claims or proceedings, penalties and remediation costs. We have numerous e-commerce and e-marketing portals and our systems may contain personal information of customers or employees; therefore, we must continue to be diligent in protecting against malicious cyber attacks.   We have been the target of attempted cyber attacks and other security threats and we may be subject to breaches of our IT systems. We have programs in place that are intended to detect, contain, and respond to data security incidents and that provide employee awareness training regarding phishing, malware and other cyber risks. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. If our security measures are breached or fail, unauthorized persons may be able to obtain access to or acquire personal or other confidential data. Depending on the nature of the information compromised, we may also have obligations to notify consumers and/or employees about the incident, and we may need to provide some form of remedy, such as a subscription to a credit monitoring service, for the individuals affected by the incident. This could negatively affect our relationships with customers or trading partners, lead to potential claims against the Company, and damage our image and reputation.12Table of ContentsWe rely on third parties for computing, storage, processing, and similar services.  Any disruption of or interference with our use of these third-party services could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results.Certain of our business system reside on third-party outsourced cloud infrastructure providers. We are therefore vulnerable to service interruptions experienced by these providers and could experience interruptions, delays, or outages in service availability in the future due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human, hardware or software errors, hosting disruptions, and capacity constraints.  While we have mitigation and service redundancy plans in place, outages and/or capacity constraints could still arise from a number of causes such as technical failures, natural disasters, fraud, or internal or third-party security attacks which could negatively impact our ability to manufacture and operate our business.  We collect, store, process, share, and use personal information, and rely on third parties that are not directly under our control to do so as well, which subjects us to legal obligations, laws and regulations related to security and privacy, and any actual or perceived failure to meet those obligations could harm our business.We are subject to various data protection and privacy laws and regulations in the countries where we operate because we collect, store, process, share, and use personal information, and we rely on third parties that are not directly under our control to do so as well. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union (EU) went into effect in May 2018 and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) became effective January 1, 2020. Although we have implemented plans to comply with the laws, GDPR, CCPA, and future law and regulations could impose an even greater compliance burden and risk with respect to privacy and data security than prior laws.  The EU (through the GDPR) and a growing number of legislative and regulatory bodies elsewhere in the world have adopted consumer notification requirements in the event of unauthorized access to or acquisition of certain types of personal information. These breach notification laws continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. Complying with these obligations could cause us to incur substantial costs, require significant management time and attention, and increase negative publicity surrounding any incident that compromises personal information. Inventory reductions by major dealers, retailers, and independent boat builders could adversely affect our financial results.The Company and our dealers, retailers, and other distributors could decide to reduce the number of units they hold, particularly if demand trails forecasted levels or if new product introductions are expected to replace existing products. Such efforts tend to result in wholesale sales reductions in excess of retail sales reductions and would likely result in lower production levels of certain of our products, potentially causing lower rates of absorption of fixed costs in our manufacturing facilities and lower margins. While we have processes in place to help manage dealer inventories at appropriate levels, potential inventory reductions remain a risk to our future sales and results of operations.We may be required to repurchase inventory or accounts of certain dealers.We have agreements with certain third-party finance companies to provide financing to our customers, enabling them to purchase our products. In connection with these agreements, we may either have obligations to repurchase our products from the finance company or have recourse obligations. These obligations may be triggered if our dealers default on their payment or other obligations to the finance companies.Our maximum contingent obligation to repurchase inventory and our maximum contingent recourse obligations on customer receivables are less than the total balances of dealer financings outstanding under these programs, because our obligations under certain of these arrangements are subject to caps, or are limited based on the age of product. Our risk related to these arrangements is partially mitigated by the proceeds we receive on the resale of repurchased product to other dealers, or by recoveries on receivables purchased under the recourse obligations.Our inventory repurchase obligations relate primarily to the inventory floorplan credit facilities of our boat and engine dealers. Our actual historical repurchase experience related to these arrangements has been substantially less than our maximum contractual obligations. If dealers default on their obligations, file for bankruptcy, or cease operations, however, we could incur losses associated with the repurchase of our products.  In addition, our net sales and earnings may be unfavorably affected due to reduced market coverage and an associated decline in sales.Declines in marine industry demand could cause an increase in future repurchase activity, or could require us to incur losses in excess of established reserves. In addition, our cash flow and loss experience could be adversely affected if repurchased inventory is not successfully distributed to other dealers in a timely manner, or if the recovery rate on the resale of the product declines.  The finance companies could require changes in repurchase or recourse terms that would result in an increase in our contractual contingent obligations.13Table of ContentsOur financial results may be adversely affected by our third party suppliers' increased costs or inability to meet required production levels due to tariff impacts or defects or disruption of supply of raw materials, parts, and product components.We rely on third parties to supply raw materials used in the manufacturing process, including oil, aluminum, copper, steel, and resins, as well as product parts and components.  The prices for these raw materials, parts, and components fluctuate depending on market conditions and, in some instances, commodity prices or trade policies. Substantial increases in the prices of raw materials, parts, and components would increase our operating costs, and could reduce our profitability if we are unable to recoup the increased costs through higher product prices. Similarly, if a critical supplier were to close its operations, cease manufacturing, or otherwise fail to deliver an essential component necessary to our manufacturing operations, that could detrimentally affect our ability to manufacture and sell our products, resulting in an interruption in business operations and/or a loss of sales. In addition, some components used in our manufacturing processes, including certain engine components, furniture, upholstery, and boat windshields, are available from a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers. Operational and financial difficulties that these or other suppliers may face in the future could adversely affect their ability to supply us with the parts and components we need, which could significantly disrupt our operations. It may be difficult to find a replacement supplier for a limited or sole source raw material, part, or component without significant delay or on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, an uncorrected defect or supplier's variation in a raw material, part, or component, either unknown to us or incompatible with our manufacturing process, could jeopardize our ability to manufacture products.  Some additional supply risks that could disrupt our operations, impair our ability to deliver products to customers, and negatively affect our financial results include: •financial pressures on our suppliers due to a weakening economy or unfavorable conditions in other end markets; •a deterioration of our relationships with suppliers;•events such as natural disasters, power outages or labor strikes; •an outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as the existing threat of coronavirus, particularly as it may impact our operations and supply chain in China;•supplier manufacturing constraints and investment requirements; or•labor disruption at major global ports and shipping hubs.These risks are exacerbated in the case of single-source suppliers, and the exclusive supplier of a key component potentially could exert significant bargaining power over price, quality, warranty claims, or other terms.We continue to increase production; consequently, our need for raw materials and supplies continues to increase. Our suppliers must be prepared to ramp up operations and, in many cases, hire additional workers and/or expand capacity in order to fulfill our orders and those of other customers. Cost increases, defects, or sustained interruptions in the supply of raw materials, parts, or components due to delayed start-up periods our suppliers experience as they increase production efforts create risks to our operations and financial results. The Company experienced periodic supply shortages and increases in costs to certain materials, such as aluminum, in 2019. We continue to address these issues by identifying alternative suppliers for key materials and components, working to secure adequate inventories of critical supplies, and continually monitoring the capabilities of our supplier base. In the future, however, we may experience shortages, delayed delivery, and/or increased prices for key materials, parts, and supplies that are essential to our manufacturing operations.Higher energy and fuel costs can affect our results.Higher energy and fuel costs increase operating expenses at our manufacturing facilities and the cost of shipping products to customers. In addition, increases in energy costs can adversely affect the pricing and availability of petroleum-based raw materials such as resins and foam that are used in many of our marine products. Higher fuel prices may also have an adverse effect on demand for our parts and accessories businesses, as they increase the cost of boat ownership and possibly affect product use.Either inadequate intellectual property protection that could allow others to use our technologies and impair our ability to compete, or failure to successfully defend against patent infringement claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.We regard much of the technology underlying our products as proprietary. We rely on a combination of patents, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws; employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements; and other contracts to establish and protect our technology and other intellectual property rights. However, we remain subject to risks, including:•the steps we take to protect our proprietary technology may be inadequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology;•third parties may independently develop similar technology;14Table of Contents•agreements containing protections may be breached or terminated;•we may not have adequate remedies for breaches; •existing patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws may afford limited protection;•a third party could copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization; or•we may be required to litigate to enforce our intellectual property rights, and we may not be successful.Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult, particularly outside the U.S., and litigating intellectual property claims may result in substantial cost and divert management’s attention.  In addition, we may be required to defend our products against patent or other intellectual property infringement claims or litigation. In addition to defense expenses and costs, we may not prevail in such cases, forcing us to seek licenses or royalty arrangements from third parties, which we may not be able to obtain on reasonable terms, or subjecting us to an order or requirement to stop manufacturing, using, selling, or distributing products that included challenged intellectual property, which could harm our business and financial results.We have a fixed cost base that can affect our profitability in a declining sales environment.The fixed cost levels of operating production facilities can put pressure on profit margins when sales and production decline. We have maintained discipline over our fixed cost base during the economic recovery, and improvements in gross margin can help mitigate the risks related to a fixed cost base. However, our profitability is dependent, in part, on our ability to absorb fixed costs over an increasing number of products sold and shipped. Decreased demand or the need to reduce inventories can lower our production levels and impact our ability to absorb fixed costs, consequently materially impacting our results.An inability to identify and complete targeted acquisitions could negatively impact financial results.Our growth initiatives include making strategic acquisitions, which depend on the availability of suitable targets at acceptable terms and our ability to complete the transactions. In managing our acquisition strategy, we conduct rigorous due diligence, involve various functions, and continually review target acquisitions, all of which we believe mitigates some of our acquisition risks. However, we cannot assure that suitable acquisitions will be identified or consummated or that, if consummated, they will be successful. Acquisitions include a number of risks, including our ability to project and evaluate market demand, potential synergies, and cost savings, and our ability to make accurate accounting estimates, as well as diversion of management attention. Uncertainties exist in assessing the value, risks, profitability, and liabilities associated with certain businesses or assets, negotiating acceptable terms, obtaining financing on acceptable terms, and receiving any necessary regulatory approvals. As we continue to grow, in part, through acquisitions, our success depends on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these risks.  Any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.There can be no assurance that strategic divestitures or restructurings will provide business benefits.As part of our strategy, we continuously evaluate our portfolio of businesses. Recent results of this evaluation include the sale of the Fitness business, the discontinuation of Sea Ray Sport Yacht and Yacht models, and winding down yacht production.  We have previously and may in the future make other changes to our portfolio as well, which may be material. Divestitures involve risks, including difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products and personnel, disruption in our operations or businesses, finding a suitable purchaser, the diversion of management's attention from our other businesses, the potential loss of key employees, adverse effects on relationships with our dealer or supplier partners or their businesses, the erosion of employee morale or customer confidence, and the retention of contingent liabilities related to the divested business. If we do not successfully manage the risks associated with divestitures, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected as the potential strategic benefits may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected. The completed Fitness business separation could be disruptive to the business and our operations, and there can be no assurance that it will provide all of the anticipated business benefits.On June 27, 2019, the Company completed the sale (Sale) of the Fitness business to KPS Capital Partners, LP (KPS), which Sale included a transition services arrangement. Like any business separation, the Sale involves risks, including difficulties associated with the separation of operations, services, and personnel, disruption in our operations or businesses, the potential loss of key employees, and adverse effects on relationships with business partners. In addition, we have incurred, and continue to incur, expenses in connection with the separation, and the completion of the transition services arrangement requires time and effort by the Company’s management team, which may divert management’s attention from other aspects of our business operations. Also, in connection with the Sale, we agreed to indemnify KPS for certain specified matters, including product liability and regulatory matters.  If we do not successfully manage these risks, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely 15Table of Contentsaffected. Furthermore, the Sale may not achieve the intended results, or results may take longer to realize than expected. The anticipated benefits of the Sale are based on a number of factors that we cannot predict.  The inability to successfully integrate acquisitions, including the Global Marine & Mobile Business of Power Products, could negatively impact financial results.On August 9, 2018, Brunswick acquired the Global Marine & Mobile business of Power Products, which includes the global marine, specialty vehicle, mobile, industrial power, and transportation aftermarket products businesses. Additionally, on May 21, 2019, Brunswick acquired 100 percent of Freedom Boat Club, a leading boat club operator based in Florida. Acquisitions pose risks, such as our ability to project and evaluate market demand; maximize potential synergies and cost savings; make accurate accounting estimates; and achieve anticipated business objectives. The Power Products and Freedom Boat Club acquisitions and other, future acquisitions, present these and other integration risks, including:•disruptions in core, adjacent, or acquired businesses that could make it more difficult to maintain business and operational relationships, including customer and supplier relationships;•the possibility that the expected synergies and value creation will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time period; •the risk that unexpected costs will be incurred;•diversion of management attention; and•difficulties retaining employees.  If we fail to timely and successfully integrate new businesses, including Power Products and Freedom Boat Club, into existing operations, we may see higher costs, lost sales, or otherwise diminished earnings and financial results. The franchise business model of Freedom Boat Club presents risks.Our franchisees are an integral part of our Freedom Boat Club business and its growth strategies. We may be unable to successfully implement the growth strategies if our franchisees do not participate in the implementation of those strategies or if we are unable to attract a sufficient number of qualified franchisees. While our franchisees are required to comply with our franchise and related agreements, our franchisees are independent and manage their boat clubs as independent businesses, responsible for all day-to-day operations of their boat clubs. If these franchisees fail to maintain or act in accordance with applicable brand standards; experience service, safety or other operational problems, including any data breach involving club member information; or project a brand image inconsistent with ours, our image and reputation could suffer, which in turn could hurt our business and operating results.The timing and amount of our share repurchases are subject to a number of uncertainties.The Board of Directors has authorized the Company’s discretionary repurchase of outstanding common stock, to be systematically completed in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. In 2019, we repurchased $400 million of shares, and we plan to continue share repurchases in 2020 and beyond.  The amount and timing of share repurchases are based on a variety of factors.  Important considerations that could cause us to limit, suspend, or delay future stock repurchases include:•unfavorable market and economic conditions;•the trading price of our common stock;•the nature and magnitude of other investment opportunities available to us from time to time; and•the availability of cash.  Delaying, limiting, or suspending our stock repurchase program may negatively affect performance versus earnings per share targets, and ultimately our stock price.Our profitability may suffer as a result of competitive pricing and other pressures.The introduction of lower-priced alternative products or services by other companies can hurt our competitive position in all of our businesses. We are constantly subject to competitive pressures in which predominantly international manufacturers may pursue a strategy of aggressive pricing, particularly during periods when their local currency weakens versus the U.S. dollar. Such pricing pressure may limit our ability to increase prices for our products in response to raw material and other cost increases and negatively affect our profit margins.16Table of ContentsIn addition, our independent boat builder customers may react negatively to potential competition for their products from Brunswick’s own boat brands, which can lead them to purchase marine engines, boat systems, and marine engine supplies from competing marine engine manufacturers and may negatively affect demand for our products.Our ability to remain competitive depends on successfully introducing new products and services that meet customer expectations.We believe that our customers look for and expect quality, innovation, and advanced features when evaluating and making purchasing decisions about products and services in the marketplace. Our ability to remain competitive and meet our growth objectives may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development, such as an inability to develop viable new products or customer solutions, gain market acceptance of new products, generate sufficient capital to fund new product development, or obtain adequate intellectual property protection for new products. To meet ever-changing consumer demands, both timing of market entry and pricing of new products are critical.  As a result, we may not be able to introduce new products that are necessary to remain competitive in all markets that we serve.  Furthermore, we must continue to meet or exceed customers' expectations regarding product quality and after-sales service.We manufacture and sell products that create exposure to potential claims and litigation.Our manufacturing operations and the products we produce could result in product quality, warranty, personal injury, property damage, and other issues, thereby increasing the risk of litigation and potential liability, as well as regulatory fines. To manage this risk, we have established a global, enterprise-wide program charged with the responsibility for addressing, reviewing, and reporting on product integrity issues. Historically, the resolution of such claims has not had a materially adverse effect on our business, and we maintain what we believe to be adequate insurance coverage to mitigate a portion of these risks. However, we may experience material losses in the future, incur significant costs to defend claims or issue product recalls, experience claims in excess of our insurance coverage or that are not covered by insurance, or be subjected to fines or penalties. Our reputation may be adversely affected by such claims, whether or not successful, including potential negative publicity about our products. We record accruals for known potential liabilities, but there is the possibility that actual losses may exceed these accruals and therefore negatively impact earnings.Compliance with environmental, health, safety, zoning, and other laws and regulations may increase costs and reduce demand for our products.We are subject to federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, including product safety, environmental, health and safety, privacy, and other regulations.  While we believe that we maintain the requisite licenses and permits and that we are in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations, a failure to satisfy these and other regulatory requirements could result in fines or penalties, and compliance could increase the cost of operations. The adoption of additional laws, rules, and regulations, including stricter emissions standards, could increase our manufacturing costs, require additional product development investment, increase consumer pricing, and reduce consumer demand for our products or boat club operations.  Environmental restrictions, boat plant emission restrictions, and permitting and zoning requirements can limit production capacity, access to water for boating and marinas, and storage space. While future licensing requirements, including any licenses imposed on recreational boating, are not expected to be unduly restrictive, they may deter potential customers, thereby reducing our sales. Furthermore, regulations allowing the sale of fuel containing higher levels of ethanol for automobiles, which is not appropriate or intended for use in marine engines, may nonetheless result in increased warranty, service costs, customer dissatisfaction with products, and other claims against the Company if boaters mistakenly use this fuel in marine engines, causing damage to and the degradation of components in their marine engines.Our manufacturing processes involve the use, handling, storage and contracting for recycling or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes. Accordingly, we are subject to regulations regarding these substances, and the misuse or mishandling of such substances could expose us to liabilities, including claims for property, personal injury, or natural resources damages, or fines. We are also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property, including cleanup efforts currently underway. If a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from one of our current or former properties or another location where we have disposed of hazardous materials, we may be held liable for the contamination, regardless of knowledge or whether we were at fault, and the amount of such liability could be material.Additionally, we are subject to laws governing our relationships with employees, including, but not limited to, employment obligations as a federal contractor and employee wage, hour, and benefits issues, such as pension funding and health care benefits. Compliance with these rules and regulations, and compliance with any changes to current regulations, could increase the cost of our operations.17Table of ContentsChanges in income tax laws or enforcement could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.Although domestic tax reform legislation in the form of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), signed into law on December 22, 2017, has had an overall positive impact on our financial statements, the impact of the legislation could change as we analyze and apply additional regulations or guidance issued by the government. In addition, other changes in international and domestic tax laws, including the reaction by states to the corporate tax changes in the TCJA, and changes in tax law enforcement, could negatively impact our tax provision, cash flow, and/or tax related balance sheet amounts, including our deferred tax asset values. Changes in U.S. tax law will likely have broader implications, including impacts to the economy, currency markets, inflation environment, consumer behavior, and/or competitive dynamics, which are difficult to predict, and may positively or negatively impact the Company and our results.Certain activist shareholder actions could cause us to incur expense and hinder execution of our strategy.We actively engage in discussions with our shareholders regarding further strengthening our Company and creating long-term shareholder value. This ongoing dialogue can include certain divisive activist tactics, which can take many forms. Some shareholder activism, including potential proxy contests, could result in substantial costs, such as legal fees and expenses, and divert management’s and our Board’s attention and resources from our businesses and strategic plans. Additionally, public shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future, adversely affect our relationships with dealers, distributors, or customers, make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, and cause our stock price to fluctuate based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business. These risks could adversely affect our business and operating results.Some of our operations are conducted by joint ventures that are not operated solely for our benefit.We share ownership and management responsibilities with jointly owned companies such as BAC and Tohatsu Marine Corporation. These joint ventures may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities, or resources as the Company because they are intended to be operated for the benefit of all co-owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. If such a conflict occurred, it could negatively impact our sales or financial results"

In 2018, we continued to successfully execute our growth strategy, acquiring new parts and accessories brands and investing in innovative products, productivity, and efficiency initiatives. We expect to continue our focus on growth in the combined marine business in 2019. With respect to the Fitness segment, our focus remains firmly on completing the separation of this business from the portfolio in a timely fashion, and in a manner that maximizes value to our shareholders. The spin-off process remains on plan, and we continue to evaluate other options, including a sale of the business. In 2019, our marine business will emphasize continued product leadership, targeted acquisitions, and other growth-related investments. In the longer term, our strategy remains consistent: to design, develop, and introduce high-quality products featuring innovative technology and styling; to distribute products through a model that benefits our partners - dealers and distributors; to provide world-class service to our customers; to develop and maintain low-cost manufacturing processes, and to continually improve productivity and efficiency; to manufacture and distribute products globally with local and regional styling; to continue implementing our capital strategy, which includes allocating capital to organic growth initiatives and strategic acquisition opportunities, managing debt levels and maturities, maintaining strong cash and liquidity positions, funding pension obligations, and continuing to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases; and to attract and retain skilled employees. These strategic objectives support our plans to grow by expanding our existing businesses. Our primary objective is to enhance shareholder value by achieving returns on investments that exceed our cost of capital. Refer to Note 7 – Segment Information and Note 3 – Discontinued Operations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our segments and discontinued operations, including net sales, operating earnings, and total assets by segment. Marine Engine SegmentThe Marine Engine segment, which had net sales of $2,993.6 million in 2018, consists of the Mercury Marine Group (Mercury Marine). We believe our Marine Engine segment is a world leader in the manufacturing and sale of recreational marine engines and marine parts and accessories.  Mercury Marine manufactures and markets a full range of outboard, sterndrive, and inboard engine and propulsion systems under, among other brand names, Mercury, Mercury MerCruiser, Mercury Racing, and MotorGuide brands.

Mercury Marine supplies integrated propulsion systems to the worldwide recreational and commercial marine markets. To promote advanced propulsion systems with improved handling, performance, and efficiency, Mercury Marine also manufactures and markets advanced boat steering and engine control systems. Mercury Marine's outboard, sterndrive, and inboard engines are sold to independent boat builders, local, state, and foreign governments, and to Brunswick's Boat segment. In addition, Mercury Marine sells outboard engines through a global network of more than 6,000 marine dealers and distributors, specialty marine retailers, and marine service centers.  White River Marine Group, LLC and its subsidiaries (including Tracker and Ranger Boats) is Mercury Marine’s most significant external customer.Mercury Marine manufactures four-stroke outboard engine models ranging from 2.5 to 400 horsepower. These low-emission engines are in compliance with applicable U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requirements.  Mercury Marine's four-stroke outboard engines include Verado, a collection of outboards ranging from 250 to 400 horsepower, and Mercury Marine's naturally aspirated four-stroke outboards, ranging from 2.5 to 300 horsepower. Mercury Marine and Mercury Racing manufacture 1Table of Contentsinboard and sterndrive engine models ranging from 115 to 1,750 horsepower. Mercury Marine also manufactures two-stroke, non-DFI engines for certain markets outside the United States. In addition, most of Mercury Marine's sterndrive and inboard engines are now available with catalyst exhaust treatment and monitoring systems, and all are compliant with applicable U.S. state and federal environmental regulations.  Mercury Marine also makes engines that comply with global emissions and noise regulations.Mercury Marine continues to develop innovative products, including its all-new V8 FourStroke outboard family of engines, winning the 2018 Most Innovative Product at the New Zealand Boat Show, and a 2018 Innovation Award from the National Marine Manufacturers Association for the 3.4L V6 FourStroke outboard engines. Mercury Marine was awarded an IBEX Innovation Award in 2018 for its tiller handle assembly for portable outboard motors. 2018 also saw Mercury Marine open a state-of-the-art NVH (Noise, Vibration, Harshness) Technical Center at its global headquarters in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. Mercury Marine produces its gasoline sterndrive and outboard engines domestically in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, with outboard engines also produced internationally in China and Japan.

These businesses are leading manufacturers and distributors of marine parts and accessories throughout North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific, offering same-day or next-day delivery service to a broad array of marine service facilities. On August 9, 2018, Brunswick acquired 100 percent of the Global Marine & Mobile business of Power Products Holdings, LLC (Power Products), including the global marine, specialty vehicle, mobile, industrial power, and transportation aftermarket products businesses of Power Products, for $910 million in cash from San Francisco-based private equity firm Genstar Capital. The acquisition added a broad, complementary product portfolio of 11 new brands to Mercury Marine's parts and accessories business.Intercompany sales to Brunswick's Boat segment represented approximately 11 percent of Mercury Marine's sales in 2018. Domestic demand for the Marine Engine segment's products is seasonal, with sales generally highest in the second calendar quarter of the year. Boat SegmentThe Boat segment consists of the Brunswick Boat Group (Boat Group), which manufactures and markets the following types of boats: fiberglass sport boats, cruisers, sport fishing and center-console, offshore fishing, aluminum and fiberglass fishing, pontoon, utility, deck, inflatable, and heavy-gauge aluminum. We believe that the Boat Group, which had net sales of  $1,471.3 million during 2018, is a world leader in the manufacturing and sale of pleasure motorboats. The Boat Group manages Brunswick's boat brands; evaluates and optimizes the Boat segment's boat portfolio; promotes recreational boating services and activities to enhance the consumer experience and dealer profitability; and speeds the introduction of new technologies into boat manufacturing and design processes, including through its Business Acceleration initiatives. The Boat Group includes the following boat brands: Sea Ray sport boats and cruisers; Bayliner sport cruisers, runabouts, and Heyday wake boats; Boston Whaler fiberglass offshore boats; Lund fiberglass fishing boats; Crestliner, Cypress Cay, Harris, Lowe, Lund, and Princecraft aluminum fishing, utility, pontoon boats, and deck boats; and Thunder Jet heavy-gauge aluminum boats. The Boat Group procures most of its outboard engines, gasoline sterndrive engines, and gasoline inboard engines from Brunswick's Marine Engine segment.  2Table of ContentsThe Boat Group also includes Brunswick boat brands based in Europe and Asia-Pacific, which include Quicksilver, Uttern, and Rayglass (including Protector and Legend), that are typically equipped with Mercury Marine engines and often include other parts and accessories supplied by Mercury Marine. The Boat Group operates manufacturing facilities in Florida, Indiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Washington, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand, and Portugal, and owns an inactive manufacturing facility in North Carolina. The Boat Group also utilizes two contract manufacturing facilities in Poland.The Boat Group sells its products through a global network of nearly 1,300 dealers and distributors, with some dealers operating in more than one location and some dealers carrying more than one of our boat brands. Sales to the Boat Group's largest dealer, MarineMax, Inc., which has multiple locations and carries a number of the Boat Group's product lines, represented approximately 24 percent of Boat Group sales in 2018. Domestic demand for pleasure boats is seasonal, with sales generally highest in the second calendar quarter of the year.Fitness SegmentOur Fitness segment is comprised of the Fitness division (Fitness), which designs, manufactures, and distributes a broad portfolio of reliable, high-quality cardiovascular fitness equipment (including treadmills, total body cross-trainers, stair climbers, and stationary exercise bicycles) and strength-training equipment under the Life Fitness, Hammer Strength, Cybex, Indoor Cycling Group, and SCIFIT brands. The Fitness segment also includes an active recreation business, including billiards tables, accessories, and game room furniture. We believe that our Fitness segment, which had net sales of $1,038.3 million during 2018, is one of the world's largest manufacturers of commercial fitness equipment and a leading manufacturer of high-quality consumer fitness equipment. Fitness' commercial customers include health clubs, hospitality locations, multi-unit housing, corporations, schools and universities, military and governmental agencies, retirement and assisted living facilities, professional and collegiate sports teams, and community centers. Planet Fitness Inc. is the segment's most significant customer. Fitness makes commercial sales through its direct sales force, domestic dealers, and international distributors. Consumer products are available at specialty retailers, select mass merchants, sporting goods stores, through international distributors, and on the Life Fitness website. Further details about the Fitness business can be found in Amendment No. 1 to the Registration Statement on Form 10, File No. 001-38741, filed on February 8, 2019 by Life Fitness Holdings, Inc. However, we are not incorporating the Form 10 by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.The billiards business was established in 1845 and is Brunswick's heritage business. The billiards business designs and markets billiards tables, table tennis tables, and Air Hockey tables, as well as game room furniture and related accessories, under the Brunswick and Contender brands. The Fitness segment's principal manufacturing facilities are located in Illinois, Kentucky, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Wisconsin, and Hungary, with principal third party contract manufacturing partners in China, Mexico, Taiwan, and Indonesia. Fitness distributes its products worldwide from regional warehouses and production facilities. Demand for Fitness products is seasonal, with sales generally highest in the fourth quarter of the year.Discontinued OperationsIn December 2017, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to exit its Sea Ray business, including the Meridian brand, as a result of, among other things, a material change in strategic direction and a review of the expected future cash flows, market conditions and business trends. The Company engaged in a thorough sales process and ultimately determined that the offers received did not reflect an appropriate value for the brand. As a result, in June 2018, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to end the sale process for its Sea Ray business. As part of this action, the Company decided to restructure the businesses, including discontinuing Sea Ray Sport Yacht and Yacht models and winding down yacht production, while reinventing Sea Ray Sport Boat and Sport Cruiser operations. The winding down of Sea Ray Sport Yacht and Yacht operations was largely completed in 2018. The assets and liabilities of the Sea Ray business, which were reported as held for sale in the 2017 Form 10-K, have been reclassified to assets and liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for all periods presented. Additionally, the results of these businesses are no longer presented as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, the Consolidated Statements of Operations and the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in any period presented.  In the fourth quarter of 2018, the Company made adjustments to certain liabilities that were retained as part of the sale of  the retail bowling business in 2014 and the bowling products business in 2015. The Company does not have continuing involvement or cash flows associated with these businesses, which were previously reported as discontinued operations in the Consolidated 3Table of ContentsStatements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.  As a result of these adjustments, the Company recognized $2.2 million of after-tax earnings as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2018.            Refer to Note 3 – Discontinued Operations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations.Boating Services Network and Business Acceleration Boating Services Network is our leading dealer finance and operations service that includes floor planning from Brunswick Acceptance Corporation (USA) and Brunswick Commercial Finance (Canada), retail finance from Blue Water Finance and Mercury Repower Finance, retail extended product protection from Passport and Passport Premier, private label limited warranties for leading boat and engine manufacturers, retail insurance from Boater's Choice Insurance, and close to 50 name brand marine dealer service providers from Brunswick Dealer Advantage. In 2018, Boating Services Network launched OnBoard Boating Cluband Rentals, a state-of-the-art, turnkey business platform empowering marine dealers and marinas to expand their operations and serve the emerging and rapidly growing boat club and rental consumer market segments. The suite of boats, tools, and services available through OnBoard enables club and rental operators to provide club members and rental customers an exceptional boating experience with a diverse fleet of newer boats, an easy-to-use online reservation system, incentives for members to become boat owners as they become captivated by the boating lifestyle, and many more benefits over time. We  also launched NAUTIC-ON, a smart technology and service system that helps boaters stay connected with their boats remotely, monitoring engine status, battery and bilge pump, and providing other advanced features, in 2018. We provide financial services through Brunswick Product Protection Corporation, which provides marine dealers the opportunity to offer extended product warranties to retail customers, and through Blue Water Dealer Services, Inc., which provides retail financial services to marine dealers. Each company allows us to offer a more complete line of financial services to our boat and marine engine dealers and their customers.Financing Joint VentureThrough our Brunswick Financial Services Corporation subsidiary, we own a 49 percent interest in a joint venture, Brunswick Acceptance Company, LLC (BAC). Under the terms of the joint venture agreement, BAC provides secured wholesale inventory floorplan financing to our boat and engine dealers. A subsidiary of Wells Fargo & Company owns the remaining 51 percent.In February 2018, the parties entered into an amended and restated joint venture agreement (JV Agreement) to extend the term of their financial services through December 31, 2022. The JV Agreement contains a financial covenant that conforms to the maximum leverage ratio test in the Credit Facility described in Note 17 – Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The joint venture agreement contains provisions allowing for the renewal of the agreement or the purchase of the other party’s interest in the joint venture at the end of its term. Alternatively, either partner may terminate the agreement at the end of its term.Refer to Note 11 – Financing Joint Venture in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our financial services. DistributionWe utilize independent distributors, dealers, and retailers (Dealers) for the majority of our boat sales and significant portions of our sales of marine engine, fitness, and billiards products. We have over 16,000 Dealers serving our business segments worldwide. Our marine Dealers typically carry one or more of the following product categories: boats, engines, and related parts and accessories. We own Land 'N' Sea, Kellogg Marine Supply, Payne's Marine Group, and Del City, which comprise the primary parts and accessories distribution platforms for our Marine Engine segment in North America. We believe that these businesses, collectively, are the leading distributors of marine parts and accessories throughout North America, with 21 distribution warehouses located throughout the United States and Canada offering same-day or next-day delivery service to a broad array of marine service facilities and Dealers. We also believe we are a leading parts and accessories distributor in the Asia-Pacific region. Our Dealers are independent companies or proprietors that range in size from small, family-owned businesses to a large, publicly-traded corporation with substantial revenues and multiple locations. Some Dealers sell our products exclusively, while a majority also carry competitor and complementary products. We partner with our boat dealer network to improve quality, service, 4Table of Contentsdistribution, and delivery of parts and accessories to enhance the boating customer's experience. Demand for a significant portion of our products is seasonal, and a number of our Dealers are relatively small and/or highly-leveraged. As a result, many Dealers secure floor plan financing from BAC or other third party finance companies, enabling them to provide stable channels for our products. In addition to the financing BAC offers, we may also provide our Dealers with incentive programs, loan guarantees, inventory repurchase commitments, and financing receivable arrangements, under which we are obligated to repurchase inventory or receivables from a finance company in the event of a Dealer's default. We believe that these arrangements are in our best interest; however, these arrangements expose us to credit and business risk. Our business units, along with BAC, maintain active credit operations to manage this financial exposure, and we continually seek opportunities to sustain and improve the financial health of our various distribution channel partners. Refer to Note 9 – Financing Receivables and Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these arrangements.Technology and Innovation Upon the completion of the separation of our Fitness business, Brunswick will transition into a company concentrated on leading the global marine industry with a sharpened focus and clear vision, consistently innovating the future of recreational boating. To support this goal, we have established a strong foundation of cross functional and cross business investments and initiatives to further improve customer interaction with our products, including NAUTIC-ON and OnBoard Boating Club and Rentals. We continue to partner with TechNexus Holdings, LLC to identify and incubate innovative start-up ventures with strategic marine applications to help drive long-term growth. For its part, Fitness continues to develop digital solutions focused on providing innovative solutions to meet the needs of fitness facilities and exercisers. In addition, Fitness is collaborating with a number of technology companies to accelerate the development of its technology portfolio to satisfy growing demand for digital fitness and connectivity solutions.

International OperationsNon-U.S. sales are set forth in Note 7 – Segment Information and Note 2 – Revenue Recognition in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and are also included in the table below, which details our non-U.S. sales by region:(in millions)2018 2017 2016Europe$696.2 $610.1 $569.2Asia-Pacific437.0 407.9 363.1Canada317.3 320.3 284.6Rest-of-World256.8 265.8 240.1Total$1,707.3 $1,604.1 $1,457.0Total International Sales as a Percentage of Net Sales33% 33% 35%We transact a portion of our sales in non-U.S. markets in local currencies, while a meaningful portion of our product costs are denominated in U.S. dollars as a result of our U.S. manufacturing operations. As a result, the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar affects the financial results of our non-U.S. operations. Marine Engine segment non-U.S. sales represented approximately 50 percent of our non-U.S. sales in 2018. The segment's principal non-U.S. operations include the following:•Distribution, sales, service, engineering, or representative offices in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Dubai, Finland, France, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Russia, Singapore, Sweden, and Switzerland; •Component, parts and accessories manufacturing, and light assembly facilities in Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and Northern Ireland;•An outboard engine assembly plant in Suzhou, China; and•    An outboard engine assembly plant operated by a joint venture in Japan.Boat segment non-U.S. sales comprised approximately 21 percent of our non-U.S. sales in 2018.  The Boat Group manufactures or assembles a portion of its products in Canada, Mexico, New Zealand, and Portugal, as well as in boat plants owned and operated 5Table of Contentsby third parties in Poland that perform contract manufacturing for us, which are sold mostly in international markets through Dealers. The Boat Group has sales or import offices in Belgium, Canada, France, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, and Sweden. Of our boat sales in Canada and Europe, approximately 38 percent and 91 percent, respectively, were produced in the region.Fitness segment non-U.S. sales comprised approximately 29 percent of our non-U.S. sales in 2018. Fitness sells its products worldwide and has sales and distribution centers in Brazil, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom. The Fitness segment manufactures strength-training equipment and select lines of cardiovascular equipment in Hungary for its international markets, and has relationships with third-party contract manufacturing partners in Taiwan, China, Mexico, and Indonesia. Raw Materials and SuppliesWe purchase a wide variety of raw materials from our supplier base, including commodities such as aluminum, resins, oil, and steel, as well as product parts and components, such as engine blocks and boat windshields. The prices for these raw materials, parts, and components fluctuate depending on market conditions. Significant increases in the cost of such materials would raise our production costs, which could reduce profitability if we did not recoup the increased costs through higher product prices. As our manufacturing operations continued to raise production levels in 2018, our need for raw materials and supplies also increased.  During 2018, we experienced some shortages or delayed delivery of certain materials, parts, and supplies essential to our manufacturing operations, although such shortages did not materially impact operations. We have addressed and will continue to address this issue by identifying alternative suppliers, working to secure adequate inventories of critical supplies, and continually monitoring the capabilities of our supplier base. In 2019, we anticipate our suppliers will need to increase their manufacturing capacity and investments to meet the rising demand for their products and, in many cases, may need to hire additional workers in order to fulfill the orders placed by us and other customers.  Our global procurement operations continue to better leverage purchasing power across our divisions and to improve supply chain and cost efficiencies. We mitigate commodity price risk on certain raw material purchases by entering into fixed priced contracts or derivatives to mitigate exposure related to changes in commodity prices. Intellectual PropertyWe have, and continue to obtain, patent rights covering certain features of our products and processes. By law, our patent rights, which consist of patents and patent licenses, have limited lives and expire periodically. We believe that our patent rights are important to our competitive position in all of our business segments. Our trademark rights have indefinite lives, and many are well known to the public and are considered to be valuable assets. Most of our intellectual property is owned by U.S. entities.  In the Marine Engine segment, patent rights principally relate to features of outboard engines and inboard-outboard drives, hybrid drives, and pod drives, including: die-cast powerheads; cooling and exhaust systems; drivetrain, clutch, and gearshift mechanisms; boat/engine mountings; shock-absorbing tilt mechanisms; ignition systems; propellers; marine vessel control systems; fuel and oil injection systems; supercharged engines; outboard mid-section structures; segmented cowls; hydraulic trim, tilt and steering; screw compressor charge air cooling systems; a range of proprietary metal alloys; and airflow silencers. In the Boat segment, patent rights principally relate to processes for manufacturing fiberglass hulls, decks, and components for boat products, as well as patent rights related to boat features and components. In the Fitness segment, patent rights principally relate to fitness equipment designs and components, including patents covering internal processes, programming functions, displays, design features and styling, as well as billiards table designs and components. The following are our principal trademarks: Marine Engine Segment:  Ancor, Attwood, Axius, BEP, Blue Sea Systems, CZone, Del City, FulTyme RV, Garelick, Kellogg Marine Supply, Land 'N' Sea, Lenco Marine, Marinco, Mariner, Mastervolt, MerCruiser, Mercury, Mercury Marine, Mercury Precision Parts, Mercury Propellers, Mercury Racing, MotorGuide, OptiMax, Park Power, Progressive Industries, ProMariner, Quicksilver, Seachoice, SeaPro, SmartCraft, Sport-Jet, Swivl-Eze, Talamex, Valiant, Verado, Whale, and Zeus.Boat Segment:  Bayliner, Boston Whaler, Crestliner, Cypress Cay, Harris, Heyday, Lowe, Lund, Master Dealer, Meridian, Princecraft, Protector, Quicksilver, Rayglass, Sea Ray, Thunder Jet, and Uttern.6Table of ContentsFitness Segment:  Air Hockey, Brunswick, Contender, Cybex, Flex Deck, Gold Crown, Hammer Strength, Indoor Cycling Group, Lifecycle, Life Fitness, and SCIFIT.Competitive Conditions and PositionWe believe that we have a reputation for quality in each of our highly competitive lines of business. We compete in various markets by: utilizing efficient production techniques; developing and strengthening our leading brands; developing and promoting innovative technological advancements; undertaking effective marketing, advertising, and sales efforts; providing high-quality, innovative products at competitive prices; and offering extensive aftermarket products. Strong competition exists in each of our product groups, but no single enterprise competes with us in all product groups. In each product area, competitors range in size from large, highly-diversified companies to small, single-product businesses. We also indirectly compete with businesses that offer alternative leisure products or activities. The following summarizes our competitive position in each segment: Marine Engine Segment: We believe the Marine Engine segment is a world leader in the manufacture and sale of recreational and commercial marine engines and marine parts and accessories. The marine engine market is highly competitive among several major international companies that comprise the majority of the market, including Japanese-based outboard engine manufacturers, as well as several smaller companies including Chinese manufacturers. Competitive advantage in this segment is a function of product features, technological leadership, quality, service, pricing, performance, manufacturing capabilities, depth of product portfolio, intuitive product controls, and durability, along with effective promotion and distribution. Boat Segment: We believe that the Boat segment is a world leader in the manufacture and sale of pleasure motorboats. There are several major manufacturers of pleasure and offshore fishing boats, along with hundreds of smaller manufacturers. However, few major manufacturers compete in the breadth of categories or geographies in which our Boat segment competes. Consequently, this business is highly competitive  by category but also highly fragmented. In all of our boat operations, we compete on the basis of product features, technology, quality, brand strength, dealer service, pricing, performance, value, durability and styling, along with effective promotion and distribution. Fitness Segment: We believe we are the world's largest manufacturer of commercial fitness equipment and a leading manufacturer of high-quality consumer fitness equipment and billiards tables. The fitness equipment industry is highly competitive among several major international companies that comprise the majority of the market, as well as many smaller manufacturers, which creates a highly fragmented, competitive landscape. Many of our fitness equipment offerings include industry-leading product features, and we place significant emphasis on introducing innovative fitness equipment to the market. Competitive focus is also placed on product quality, technology, service, pricing, state-of-the-art biomechanics, connectivity and customer solutions, and effective promotional activities.  The billiards industry continues to experience competitive pressure from low-cost billiards manufacturers outside the United States.   Research and DevelopmentWe strive to improve our competitive position in all of our segments by continuously investing in research and development to drive innovation in our products and manufacturing technologies. Our research and development investments support the introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products. Research and development expenses were 2.9 percent, 3.0 percent and 3.1 percent of net sales in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Research and development expenses by segment are discussed in Note 7 – Segment Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 7Table of ContentsNumber of EmployeesThe number of employees worldwide is shown below by segment:     December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Total Union (domestic) Total Union (domestic)Marine Engine7,719 2,402 6,541 2,078Boat4,996 — 5,365 —Fitness2,956 170 2,854 166Corporate (A)367 — 356 —Total (B)16,038 2,572 15,116 2,244(A) Corporate numbers include certain information technology employees and shared service employees.    (B)  All employee numbers exclude temporary employees.We believe that the relationships between our employees, applicable labor unions, and the Company remain stable.  Mercury Marine and its largest union, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) Lodge 1947, agreed to a new collective bargaining agreement in February 2018 which will remain in place through August 26, 2023. Environmental RequirementsRefer to Note 14 – Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of certain environmental proceedings.Available InformationBrunswick maintains an Internet website at http://www.brunswick.com that includes links to our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports, and Proxy Statements (SEC Filings). The SEC Filings are available without charge as soon as reasonably practicable following the time that they are filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. Shareholders and other interested parties may request email notification of the posting of these documents through the Investors section of our website. Brunswick’s SEC Filings are also available on the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov. 8Table of Contents Item 1A.  Risk Factors
The Company's operations and financial results are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including those described below, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock.Worldwide economic conditions significantly affect our industries and businesses, and economic decline can materially impact our financial results.In times of economic uncertainty and contraction, consumers tend to have less discretionary income and to defer expenditures for discretionary items, which adversely affects our financial performance, especially in the marine businesses.  Although we have expanded the portions of our portfolio that are dependent or substantially weighted toward the usage and maintenance of boats and engines versus the sale of new product and therefore less susceptible to economic cycles, a portion of the business remains cyclical and sensitive to personal spending levels. Deterioration in general economic conditions that in turn diminishes consumer confidence or discretionary income may reduce our sales, or we may decide to lower pricing for our products, thus adversely affecting our financial results, including increasing the potential for future impairment charges. Further, most of our products are used for recreation, and consumers’ limited discretionary income in times of economic hardship may be diverted to other activities that occupy their time, such as other forms of recreation, religious, cultural, or community activities.  We cannot predict the timing or continued strength of global economies, either worldwide or in the specific markets in which we compete.  Failure to successfully implement our strategic plan and growth initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.Our ability to continue generating strong cash flow and profits depends partly on the sustained successful execution of our strategic plan and growth initiatives, including optimizing our business portfolio, making acquisitions, and expanding into new adjacent markets and customers. To address risks associated with our plan and growth initiatives, we have established processes to regularly review, manage, and modify our plans, and we believe we have appropriate oversight to monitor initiatives and their impact. Our strategic plan and growth initiatives may require significant capital investment and management attention, however, which could result in the diversion of these resources from the core business and other business issues and opportunities. Additionally, any new initiative is subject to certain risks, including customer acceptance, competition, the ability to manufacture products on schedule and to specification, the ability to create the necessary supply chain, and/or the ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel.  There is no assurance that we will be able to develop and successfully implement our strategic plan and growth initiatives in a manner that fully achieves our strategic objectives.The inability to successfully integrate new acquisitions, including the Global Marine Business of Power Products, could negatively impact financial results.On August 9, 2018, Brunswick acquired the Global Marine & Mobile business of Power Products, which includes the global marine, specialty vehicle, mobile, industrial power, and transportation aftermarket products businesses. Acquisitions pose risks, such as our ability to project and evaluate market demand; maximize potential synergies and cost savings; make accurate accounting estimates; and achieve anticipated business objectives. The Power Products acquisition and other, future acquisitions, present these and other integration risks, including:•disruptions in core, adjacent, or acquired businesses that could make it more difficult to maintain business and operational relationships, including customer and supplier relationships;•the possibility that the expected synergies and value creation will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time period; •the risk that unexpected costs will be incurred;•diversion of management attention; and•difficulties retaining employees.  If we fail to timely and successfully integrate new businesses, including Power Products, into existing operations, we may see higher production costs, lost sales, or otherwise diminished earnings and financial results. 9Table of ContentsThe anticipated Fitness business separation could be disruptive to the business and our operations, and there can be no assurance that it will provide business benefits or that it will be consummated within the anticipated time period or at all.The Fitness business separation, whether ultimately a spin-off or a sale, like any business separation, involves risks, including difficulties associated with the separation of operations, services, and personnel, disruption in our operations or businesses, the potential loss of key employees, and adverse effects on relationships with business partners. In addition, we will incur significant expense in connection with the separation, and completion of the proposed transaction will require significant amounts of management time and effort, which may divert management’s attention from other aspects of our business operations. If we do not successfully manage these risks, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected. The proposed separation may not achieve the intended results, or results may take longer to realize than expected. Unanticipated developments could delay, prevent, or otherwise adversely affect the separation, including  disruptions in general market conditions or other developments. The anticipated benefits of the separation are based on a number of assumptions, some of which may prove incorrect, and we cannot predict the prices at which our common stock, or the common stock of the Fitness stand-alone entity, may trade after the proposed separation. In addition, we cannot assure that we will be able to complete the business separation within the announced timeline, or at all. Delays or failure to consummate the separation could negatively affect our business and financial results.In addition to these risks, we face other risks specific to a spin-off of the Fitness business, as opposed to a sale, including the risk that a spin-off could result in significant tax liability to the Company or our shareholders, despite the steps we have taken to avoid this result. Completion of the spin-off is conditioned on our receipt of a written legal opinion to the effect that the distribution of Life Fitness common stock will qualify for non-recognition of gain and loss for U.S. Federal income tax purposes. The legal opinion will not address any U.S. state or local or foreign tax consequences of the spin-off, and will rely on the continuing effectiveness and validity of the favorable private letter ruling (the “IRS Ruling”) from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) regarding such U.S. Federal income tax consequences of the spin-off. The Company has received the IRS Ruling, which relies on certain facts, assumptions, representations, and undertakings from Fitness business and from Brunswick. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations, or undertakings is incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, we may not be able to rely on the IRS Ruling. In addition, the IRS ruling is not a comprehensive ruling from the IRS regarding all aspects of the U.S. Federal income tax consequences of the transactions. Accordingly, notwithstanding the legal opinion and the IRS Ruling, there can be no assurance that the IRS will not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a contrary position.Further, the legal opinion will be based on certain representations as to factual matters from the Company and the Fitness business. The opinion cannot be relied on if any of the assumptions, representations, or covenants is incorrect, incomplete, or inaccurate, or is violated in any material respect. If the distribution of Life Fitness common stock were determined not to qualify for non-recognition of gain and loss for U.S. Federal income tax purposes, U.S. holders could be subject to significant tax consequences. The final determination to proceed with a spin-off or sale is a decision of our Board of Directors, and this determination could have an adverse impact on the Company's financial results. There are many factors that could impact the structure or timing of, the anticipated benefits from, or determination to ultimately proceed with, the separation, including global economic conditions, tax considerations, market conditions, and changes in the regulatory or legal environment, any of which could adversely impact the value of the separation transaction to our shareholders. Additionally, the completion of the separation will be complex, costly, and time-consuming, and an inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits, as well as delays encountered in the process, could have an adverse effect upon the revenues, costs, and operating results of the Company.An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill, trade names, and other long-lived assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth.Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as our trade names, are recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition and are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. In evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill and trade names, we make assumptions regarding future operating performance, business trends, and market and economic conditions. Such analyses further require us to make certain assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates, and discount rates. Uncertainties are inherent in evaluating and applying these factors to the assessment of goodwill and trade name recoverability. We could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill or trade names prior to the annual assessment if we experience business disruptions, unexpected significant declines in operating results, a divestiture of a significant component of our business, or declines in market capitalization.As of the Company’s annual goodwill impairment testing date on October 1, 2018, the estimated fair value of the Fitness reporting unit was approximately 19 percent in excess of its carrying value, which included goodwill of $390.8 million. In making 10Table of Contentsthis determination, management made several significant assumptions that impact the estimated fair value of the Fitness reporting unit, including projected results, such as improvement of operating performance, particularly expanded gross margins, which are predicated upon the successful execution of cost reduction initiatives along with increased sales, in future years when compared with 2018 and the discount rate. While we believe current gross margin and sales projections are reasonable, the Fitness segment’s ability to expand gross margins or grow sales in line with projections could be negatively affected by its ability to execute the planned actions underlying the forecasted improvement in its performance as well as market conditions. Fair value determinations require considerable judgment and are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions and factors. As a result, there can be no assurance that the estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the impairment test will prove to be an accurate prediction of the future. To the extent future operating results differ from those in our current forecast, or if the assumptions underlying the discount rate change, it is possible that an impairment charge could be recorded.We also continually evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of our definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets may warrant revision or whether the remaining balance of such assets may not be recoverable. We use an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flow over the remaining life of the asset in measuring whether the asset is recoverable.As of December 31, 2018, goodwill was approximately 13 percent of total assets and included $391 million of goodwill related to the Fitness segment, $32 million of goodwill related to the Marine Engine segment, and $2 million of goodwill related to the Boat segment. If the future operating performance of the Company's reporting units is not sufficient, we could be required to record non-cash impairment charges. Impairment charges could substantially affect our reported earnings in the periods such charges are recorded. In addition, impairment charges could indicate a reduction in business value which could limit our ability to obtain adequate financing in the future.  Changes to U.S. trade policy, tariffs, and import/export regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Changes in laws and policies governing foreign trade could adversely affect our business. As a result of recent policy changes, there may be greater restrictions and economic disincentives on international trade. The new tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy could trigger retaliatory actions by affected countries, and certain foreign governments have instituted or are considering imposing trade sanctions on certain U.S. goods, such as aluminum and steel. Although we were recently granted exclusion from Section 301 tariffs for Mercury Marine 40, 50, and 60 horsepower engines, these exclusions are only in effect through the end of 2019, we continue to be subject to meaningful other tariffs, and there is no assurance that we will be granted similar exclusions for these or other products in the future, or that we will not be subject to additional tariffs. Like many other multinational corporations, we do a significant amount of business that would be affected by changes to the trade policies of the U.S. and foreign countries (including governmental action related to tariffs and international trade agreements). Such changes have the potential to adversely impact the U.S. economy, our industry, and global demand for our products and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.An inability to identify and complete targeted acquisitions could negatively impact financial results.Our growth initiatives include making strategic acquisitions, which depend on the availability of suitable targets at acceptable terms and our ability to complete the transactions. In managing our acquisition strategy, we conduct rigorous due diligence, involve various functions, and continually review target acquisitions, all of which we believe mitigates some of our acquisition risks. However, we cannot assure that suitable acquisitions will be identified or consummated or that, if consummated, they will be successful. Acquisitions include a number of risks, including our ability to project and evaluate market demand, potential synergies, and cost savings, and our ability to make accurate accounting estimates, as well as diversion of management attention. Uncertainties exist in assessing the value, risks, profitability, and liabilities associated with certain businesses or assets, negotiating acceptable terms, obtaining financing on acceptable terms, and receiving any necessary regulatory approvals. As we continue to grow, in part, through acquisitions, our success depends on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these risks.  Any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.There can be no assurance that strategic divestitures will provide business benefits.As part of our strategy, we continuously evaluate our portfolio of businesses. Recent results of this evaluation include the planned separation of the Fitness business, the discontinuation of Sea Ray Sport Yacht and Yacht models, and winding down yacht production.  We have previously and may in the future make other changes to our portfolio as well, which may be material. Divestitures involve risks, including difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products and personnel, disruption in our operations or businesses, finding a suitable purchaser, the diversion of management's attention from our other businesses, the potential loss of key employees, adverse effects on relationships with our dealer or supplier partners or their businesses, the erosion 11Table of Contentsof employee morale or customer confidence, and the retention of contingent liabilities related to the divested business. If we do not successfully manage the risks associated with divestitures, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected as the potential strategic benefits may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected. Changes in currency exchange rates can adversely affect our results.Some of our sales are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. Consequently, a strong U.S. dollar may adversely affect reported revenues and our profitability. We have hedging programs in place to reduce our risk to currency fluctuations; however, we cannot hedge against all currency risks, especially over the long term. We maintain a portion of our cost structure in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which partially mitigates the impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar. This includes manufacturing operations for boats in Europe and Canada, fitness equipment in Europe, and smaller outboard engines manufactured and purchased from our joint venture in Japan.  We also continue to evaluate the supply chain and cost structure for opportunities to further mitigate foreign currency risks.  We sell products manufactured in the U.S. into certain international markets in U.S. dollars, including to Canada, Europe, and Latin America. Demand for our products in these markets may be diminished by a strengthening U.S. dollar, or we may need to lower prices to remain competitive. Some of our competitors with cost positions based outside the U.S., including Asian-based outboard engine and fitness equipment manufacturers, European-based large fiberglass boat manufacturers, and a European-based fitness equipment manufacturer, may have an improved cost position due to a strengthening U.S. dollar, which could result in pricing pressures on our products. Although these factors have existed for several years, we do not believe they have had a material adverse effect on our competitive position.Fiscal concerns may negatively impact worldwide credit conditions and adversely affect our industries, businesses, and financial condition.Fiscal policy could have a material adverse impact on worldwide economic conditions, the financial markets, and availability of credit and, consequently, may negatively affect our industries, businesses, and overall financial condition. Customers often finance purchases of our products, particularly boats, and as interest rates rise, the cost of financing the purchase also increases. Credit market conditions, while improved, are still less favorable overall than those in existence prior to the global recession in 2008. While credit availability is adequate to support demand and interest rates remain relatively low, they have recently increased, and there are fewer lenders, tighter underwriting and loan approval criteria, as well as greater down payment requirements. If credit conditions worsen, and adversely affect the ability of customers to finance potential purchases at acceptable terms and interest rates, it could result in a decrease in sales or delay improvement in sales.Dealer or distributor inability to secure adequate access to capital could adversely affect our sales.Our dealers require adequate liquidity to finance their operations, including purchasing our products. Dealers are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could unfavorably affect their liquidity positions, including, among other things, continued access to adequate financing sources on a timely basis on reasonable terms. These financing sources are vital to our ability to sell products through our distribution network, particularly to boat and engine dealers.  Entities affiliated with Wells Fargo & Company, including BAC, the Company’s 49 percent owned joint venture, finance a significant portion of our boat and engine sales to dealers through floorplan financing to marine dealers. Many factors continue to influence the availability and terms of financing that our dealer floorplan financing providers offer, including: •their ability to access certain capital markets, such as the securitization and the commercial paper markets, and to fund their operations in a cost effective manner; •the performance of their overall credit portfolios; •their willingness to accept the risks associated with lending to marine dealers; •the overall creditworthiness of those dealers; and•the overall aging and level of pipeline inventories. Our sales could be adversely affected if financing terms change unfavorably or if BAC were to be terminated. This could require dealers to find alternative sources of financing, including our direct financing to dealers, which could require additional capital to fund the associated receivables.12Table of ContentsOur financial results could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective distribution.We rely on third-party dealers and distributors to sell most of our products, particularly in the marine businesses. Maintaining a reliable network of dealers is essential to our success. We face competition from other manufacturers in attracting and retaining distributors and independent boat dealers. For example, in 2017, Bass Pro Shops acquired Cabela's, a meaningful channel for the Lowe boat brand, and Cabela's subsequent transition away from Lowe boats required Lowe enhance its sales and distribution network by identifying alternative dealers. However, a significant deterioration in the number or effectiveness of our dealers and distributors could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.Although at present we believe dealer health to be generally favorable, weakening demand for marine products could hurt our dealers’ financial performance. In particular, reduced cash flow from decreases in sales and tightening credit markets may impair dealers' ability to fund operations. Inability to fund operations can force dealers to cease business, and we may be unable to obtain alternate distribution in the vacated market. An inability to obtain alternate distribution could unfavorably affect our net sales through reduced market presence. If economic conditions deteriorate, we anticipate that dealer failures or voluntary market exits would increase, especially if overall retail demand materially declines. Adverse economic, credit, and capital market conditions could have a negative impact on our financial results.We may rely on short-term capital markets to meet our working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, pay dividends, or fund employee benefit programs and we maintain short-term borrowing facilities that can be used to meet these capital requirements. In addition, over the long term, we may determine that it is necessary to access the capital markets to refinance existing long-term indebtedness or for other initiatives.Adverse global economic conditions, market volatility, and regulatory uncertainty could lead to volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. This could adversely affect our ability to access capital and credit markets or increase the cost to do so, which could have a negative impact on our business, financial results and competitive position.In addition, our variable rate indebtedness may use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the rate. As announced in July 2017, LIBOR is expected to be phased out by the end of 2021. Uncertainty as to the nature of alternative reference rates and as to potential changes or other reforms to LIBOR may adversely impact the availability and cost of borrowings.Loss of key customers could harm our business.In each segment, we have important relationships with key customers and, from time to time, contracts with these customers come up for renewal. We cannot be certain we will renew such contracts, or renew them on favorable terms. For example, in 2018, we were involved in a competitive request for proposal and contract negotiations with Planet Fitness, a significant customer of our Fitness business. The resulting new contract with Planet Fitness is not exclusive to Fitness, and allows Planet Fitness to purchase from Fitness or two of our competitors. If we lose a key customer, or a significant portion of its business, we could be adversely affected. In addition, certain customers could try to negotiate more favorable pricing of our products, which could depress earnings. In an effort to mitigate the risk associated with reliance on key customer accounts, we continually monitor such relationships and maintain a complete and competitive product lineup. Our business and operations are dependent on the expertise of our key contributors, our successful implementation of succession plans, and our ability to attract and retain management employees and skilled labor.The talents and efforts of our employees, particularly key managers, are vital to our success. Our management team has significant industry experience and would be difficult to replace. We may be unable to retain them or to attract other highly qualified employees. Failure to hire, develop, and retain highly qualified and diverse employee talent and to develop and implement an adequate succession plan for the management team could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business and our future success. Although we cannot ensure that all transitions will be implemented successfully, we perform an annual review of management succession plans with the Board of Directors, including reviewing executive officer and other important positions to substantially mitigate the risk associated with key contributor transitions.In October, 2018 we announced that our Chief Executive Officer, Mark Schwabero, would be retiring effective December 31, 2018, and his successor would be David Foulkes, our current CEO. In a separate action, we named a new President of the Fitness division. Our ability to continue to execute our growth strategy could potentially be adversely affected by uncertainty associated with these transitions or other, currently unanticipated, executive changes that may be disruptive to, or cause uncertainty in, our business and future strategic direction. Any such disruption or uncertainty could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. 13Table of ContentsMuch of our future success depends on, among other factors, our ability to attract and retain skilled labor. If we are not successful in these efforts, we may be unable to meet our operating goals and plans, which may impact our financial results. We continually invest in automation and improve our efficiency, but with unemployment rates at low levels in many of the geographic areas in which we manufacture or distribute goods, availability of skilled hourly workers remains critical to our operations. In order to manage this risk, we regularly monitor and make improvements to wages and benefit programs, as well as develop and improve recruiting and training programs to attract and retain an experienced and skilled workforce. Inventory reductions by major dealers, retailers, and independent boat builders could adversely affect our financial results.The Company and our dealers, retailers, and other distributors could decide to reduce the number of units they hold, particularly if demand trails forecasted levels or if new product introductions are expected to replace existing products. Such efforts tend to result in wholesale sales reductions in excess of retail sales reductions and would likely result in lower production levels of certain of our products, potentially causing lower rates of absorption of fixed costs in our manufacturing facilities and lower margins. While we have processes in place to help manage dealer inventories at appropriate levels, potential inventory reductions remain a risk to our future sales and results of operations.We may be required to repurchase inventory or accounts of certain dealers.We have agreements with certain third-party finance companies to provide financing to our customers, enabling them to purchase our products. In connection with these agreements, we may either have obligations to repurchase our products from the finance company, or may have recourse obligations to the finance company on the dealer’s receivables. These obligations may be triggered if our dealers default on their payment or other obligations to the finance companies.Our maximum contingent obligation to repurchase inventory and our maximum contingent recourse obligations on customer receivables are less than the total balances of dealer financings outstanding under these programs, because our obligations under certain of these arrangements are subject to caps, or are limited based on the age of product. Our risk related to these arrangements is mitigated by the proceeds we receive on the resale of repurchased product to other dealers, or by recoveries on receivables purchased under the recourse obligations.Our inventory repurchase obligations relate primarily to the inventory floorplan credit facilities of our boat and engine dealers. Our actual historical repurchase experience related to these arrangements has been substantially less than our maximum contractual obligations. If dealers default on their obligations, file for bankruptcy, or cease operations, however, we could incur losses associated with the repurchase of our products.  As a result, our net sales and earnings may be unfavorably affected due to reduced market coverage and an associated decline in sales.Declines in marine industry demand could cause an increase in future repurchase activity, or could require us to incur losses in excess of established reserves. In addition, our cash flow and loss experience could be adversely affected if repurchased inventory is not successfully distributed to other dealers in a timely manner, or if the recovery rate on the resale of the product declines.  The finance companies could require changes in repurchase or recourse terms that would result in an increase in our contractual contingent obligations.Our financial results may be adversely affected by our third party suppliers' increased costs or inability to meet required production levels due to tariff impacts or defects or disruption of supply of raw materials, parts, and product components.We rely on third parties to supply raw materials used in the manufacturing process, including oil, aluminum, copper, steel, and resins, as well as product parts and components.  The prices for these raw materials, parts, and components fluctuate depending on market conditions and, in some instances, commodity prices or trade policies. Substantial increases in the prices of raw materials, parts, and components would increase our operating costs, and could reduce our profitability if we are unable to recoup the increased costs through higher product prices. Similarly, if a critical supplier were to close its operations, cease manufacturing, or otherwise fail to deliver an essential component necessary to our manufacturing operations, that could detrimentally affect our ability to manufacture and sell our products, resulting in an interruption in business operations and/or a loss of sales. In addition, some components used in our manufacturing processes, including certain engine components, furniture, upholstery, and boat windshields, are available from a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers. Operational and financial difficulties that these or other suppliers may face in the future could adversely affect their ability to supply us with the parts and components we need, which could significantly disrupt our operations. It may be difficult to find a replacement supplier for a limited or sole source raw material, part, or component without significant delay or on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, an uncorrected defect or supplier's variation in a raw material, part, or component, either unknown to us or incompatible with our manufacturing process, could jeopardize our ability to manufacture products.  14Table of ContentsSome additional supply risks that could disrupt our operations, impair our ability to deliver products to customers, and negatively affect our financial results include: •financial pressures on our suppliers due to a weakening economy or unfavorable conditions in other end markets; •a deterioration of our relationships with suppliers;•events such as natural disasters, power outages or labor strikes; •supplier manufacturing constraints and investment requirements; or•labor disruption at major global ports and shipping hubs.These risks are exacerbated in the case of single-source suppliers, and the exclusive supplier of a key component potentially could exert significant bargaining power over price, quality, warranty claims, or other terms.We continue to increase production; consequently, our need for raw materials and supplies continues to increase. Our suppliers must be prepared to ramp up operations and, in many cases, hire additional workers and/or expand capacity in order to fulfill our orders and those of other customers. Cost increases, defects, or sustained interruptions in the supply of raw materials, parts, or components due to delayed start-up periods our suppliers experience as they increase production efforts create risks to our operations and financial results. The Company experienced periodic supply shortages and increases in costs to certain materials, such as aluminum, in 2018. We continue to address these issues by identifying alternative suppliers for key materials and components, working to secure adequate inventories of critical supplies, and continually monitoring the capabilities of our supplier base. In the future, however, we may experience shortages, delayed delivery, and/or increased prices for key materials, parts, and supplies that are essential to our manufacturing operations.Higher energy and fuel costs can affect our results.Higher energy and fuel costs increase operating expenses at our manufacturing facilities and the cost of shipping products to customers. In addition, increases in energy costs can adversely affect the pricing and availability of petroleum-based raw materials such as resins and foam that are used in many of our marine products. Higher fuel prices may also have an adverse effect on demand for our marine parts and accessories businesses, as they increase the cost of boat ownership and possibly affect product use.Our success depends upon the continued strength of our brands.We believe that our brands, particularly including Mercury Marine, Sea Ray, Boston Whaler, Lund, and Life Fitness, significantly contribute to our success, and that maintaining and enhancing these brands is important to expanding our customer base. A failure to adequately promote and protect our brands could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Further, in connection with the divestiture of the bowling businesses, we licensed certain trademarks and servicemarks, including use of the name “Brunswick,” to the acquiring companies. Our reputation may be adversely affected by the purchasers' inappropriate use of the marks or of the name Brunswick, including potential negative publicity, loss of confidence, or other damage to our image due to this licensed use.   Either inadequate intellectual property protection that could allow others to use our technologies and impair our ability to compete, or failure to successfully defend against patent infringement claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.We regard much of the technology underlying our products as proprietary. We rely on a combination of patents, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws; employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements; and other contracts to establish and protect our technology and other intellectual property rights. However, we remain subject to risks, including:•the steps we take to protect our proprietary technology may be inadequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology;•third parties may independently develop similar technology;•agreements containing protections may be breached or terminated;•we may not have adequate remedies for breaches; •existing patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws may afford limited protection;•a third party could copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization; or•we may be required to litigate to enforce our intellectual property rights, and we may not be successful.Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult, particularly outside the U.S., and litigating intellectual property claims may result in substantial cost and divert management’s attention.  15Table of ContentsIn addition, we may be required to defend our products against patent or other intellectual property infringement claims or litigation. In addition to defense expenses and costs, we may not prevail in such cases, forcing us to seek licenses or royalty arrangements from third parties, which we may not be able to obtain on reasonable terms, or subjecting us to an order or requirement to stop manufacturing, using, selling, or distributing products that included challenged intellectual property, which could harm our business and financial results.We have a fixed cost base that can affect our profitability in a declining sales environment.The fixed cost levels of operating production facilities can put pressure on profit margins when sales and production decline. We have maintained discipline over our fixed cost base during the economic recovery, and improvements in gross margin can help mitigate the risks related to a fixed cost base. However, our profitability is dependent, in part, on our ability to absorb fixed costs over an increasing number of products sold and shipped. Decreased demand or the need to reduce inventories can lower our production levels and impact our ability to absorb fixed costs, consequently materially impacting our results.Successfully managing our manufacturing footprint is critical to our operating and financial results.Over the past several years, we have made strategic capital investments in capacity expansion activities to successfully capture growth opportunities and enhance product offerings, including expansions at Boston Whaler in Edgewater, Florida and Mercury Marine in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. We may also make decisions to reduce our manufacturing footprint in accordance with our business strategy. We must carefully manage these capital improvement projects, expansions, and any manufacturing consolidation efforts to ensure they meet cost targets, comply with applicable environmental, safety, and other regulations, and uphold high-quality workmanship.Moving production to a different plant, expanding capacity at an existing facility, or ceasing production at a facility involves risks, including difficulties initiating production within the cost and timeframe estimated, supplying product to customers when expected, integrating new products, and attracting sufficient skilled workers to handle additional production demands. If we fail to meet these objectives, it could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand for products and increase the cost of production versus projections, both of which could result in a significant adverse impact on operating and financial results.  Additionally, plant consolidation or expansion can result in manufacturing inefficiencies, additional expenses, including higher wages or severance costs, and cost inefficiencies, which could exceed projections and negatively impact financial results.Our business operations could be negatively impacted by an outage or breach of our information technology systems or a cybersecurity event.We manage our global business operations through a variety of information technology (IT) systems which we continually enhance to increase efficiency and security. We depend on these systems for commercial transactions, customer interactions, manufacturing, branding, employee tracking, and other applications. Some of the systems are based on legacy technology and operate with a minimal level of available support, and recent acquisitions using other systems have added to the complexity of our IT infrastructure. In addition, the Fitness business separation will require separation of business and IT systems, and new systems implementations across the enterprise also pose risks of outages or disruptions, which could affect our suppliers, commercial operations, and customers. We are working to upgrade, streamline, and integrate these systems and have invested in strategies to prevent a failure or breach but, like those of other companies, our systems are susceptible to outages due to natural disasters, power loss, computer viruses, security breaches, hardware or software vulnerabilities, disruptions, and similar events.  If a legacy system or another of the Company's key systems were to fail or if our IT systems were unable to communicate effectively, this could result in missed or delayed sales or lost opportunities for cost reduction or efficient cash management.  We exchange information with hundreds of trading partners across all aspects of our commercial operations through our IT systems.  A breakdown, outage, malicious intrusion, breach, random attack, or other disruption of communications could result in erroneous or fraudulent transactions, disclosure of confidential information, loss of reputation and confidence, and may also result in legal claims or proceedings, penalties and remediation costs. We have numerous e-commerce and e-marketing portals and our systems may contain personal information of customers or employees; therefore, we must continue to be diligent in protecting against malicious cyber attacks.   We have been the target of attempted cyber-attacks and other security threats and we may be subject to breaches of our IT systems. We have programs in place that are intended to detect, contain, and respond to data security incidents and that provide employee awareness training regarding phishing, malware and other cyber risks. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. If our security measures are breached or fail, unauthorized persons may be able to obtain access to or acquire personal data. Depending on the nature of the information compromised, we may also have obligations to notify consumers and/or employees about the incident, and we may need to provide some form of remedy, such as a subscription to a credit monitoring service, for the individuals 16Table of Contentsaffected by the incident. This could negatively affect our relationships with customers or trading partners, lead to potential claims against the Company, and damage our image and reputation.Our pension funding requirements and expenses are affected by certain factors outside our control.Our funding obligations and pension expense for our two U.S. qualified pension plans are largely driven by the performance of assets set aside in trusts for these plans, the discount rate used to value the plans’ liabilities, actuarial data and experience, and legal and regulatory funding requirements. Changes in these factors could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, liquidity, or shareholders’ equity. The level of the Company's funding of our qualified pension plan liabilities was approximately 102 percent as of December 31, 2018. We continue to minimize our risks through pension de-risking actions, including investing in almost entirely fixed income investments and recently initiating the termination of both remaining U.S. qualified pension plans in 2018, which will be completed in 2019. However, our future pension expense and funding requirements could increase due to the effect of adverse changes in the discount rate and asset levels along with a decline in the estimated return on plan assets. Changes to legal regulations could require us to make increased contributions to the pension plans in 2019. In addition, the settlement will require us to recognize a substantial part of our unamortized actuarial losses as well as certain income tax consequences.The timing and amount of our share repurchases are subject to a number of uncertainties.The Board of Directors has authorized the Company’s discretionary repurchase of outstanding common stock, to be systematically completed in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions. In 2018, we repurchased $75 million of shares, and we plan to revisit additional share repurchases in 2019 after the planned Fitness business separation is completed. The amount and timing of share repurchases are based on a variety of factors.  Important considerations that could cause us to limit, suspend, or delay future stock repurchases include:•unfavorable market and economic conditions;•the trading price of our common stock;•the nature of other investment opportunities available to us from time to time; and•the availability of cash.  Delaying, limiting, or suspending our stock repurchase program may negatively affect our stock price and performance versus earnings per share targets.Our profitability may suffer as a result of competitive pricing and other pressures.The introduction of lower-priced alternative products or services by other companies can hurt our competitive position in all of our businesses. We are constantly subject to competitive pressures in which predominantly international manufacturers may pursue a strategy of aggressive pricing, particularly during periods when their local currency weakens versus the U.S. dollar. Such pricing pressure may limit our ability to increase prices for our products in response to raw material and other cost increases and negatively affect our profit margins.In addition, our independent boat builder customers may react negatively to potential competition for their products from Brunswick’s own boat brands, which can lead them to purchase marine engines and marine engine supplies from competing marine engine manufacturers and may negatively affect demand for our products.Our ability to remain competitive depends on successfully introducing new products and services that meet customer expectations.We believe that our customers look for and expect quality, innovation, and advanced features when evaluating and making purchasing decisions about products and services in the marketplace. Our ability to remain competitive and meet our growth objectives may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development, such as an inability to develop viable new products or customer solutions, gain market acceptance of new products, generate sufficient capital to fund new product development, or obtain adequate intellectual property protection for new products. To meet ever-changing consumer demands, both timing of market entry and pricing of new products are critical.  As a result, we may not be able to introduce new products that are necessary to remain competitive in all markets that we serve.  Furthermore, we must continue to meet or exceed customers' expectations regarding product quality and after-sales service.We manufacture and sell products that create exposure to potential claims and litigation.Our manufacturing operations and the products we produce could result in product quality, warranty, personal injury, property damage, and other issues, thereby increasing the risk of litigation and potential liability, as well as regulatory fines. To manage 17Table of Contentsthis risk, we have established a global, enterprise-wide program charged with the responsibility for addressing, reviewing, and reporting on product integrity issues. Historically, the resolution of such claims has not had a materially adverse effect on our business, and we maintain what we believe to be adequate insurance coverage to mitigate a portion of these risks. However, we may experience material losses in the future, incur significant costs to defend claims or issue product recalls, experience claims in excess of our insurance coverage or that are not covered by insurance, or be subjected to fines or penalties. For example, in the last two years we have reported certain Cybex products designed prior to the Cybex acquisition as well as a Life Fitness PowerMill product to the Consumer Product Safety Commission (""CPSC"") and those matters remain open. Our reputation may be adversely affected by such claims, whether or not successful, including potential negative publicity about our products. We record accruals for known potential liabilities, but there is the possibility that actual losses may exceed these accruals and therefore negatively impact earnings.Compliance with environmental, zoning, data protection, and other laws and regulations may increase costs and reduce demand for our products.We are subject to federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, including product safety, environmental, health and safety, privacy, and other regulations.  While we believe that we maintain the requisite licenses and permits and that we are in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations, a failure to satisfy these and other regulatory requirements could result in fines or penalties, and compliance could increase the cost of operations. The adoption of additional laws, rules, and regulations, including stricter emissions standards, could increase our manufacturing costs, increase consumer pricing, and reduce consumer demand for our products.  Environmental restrictions, boat plant emission restrictions, and permitting and zoning requirements can limit production capacity, access to water for boating and marinas, and storage space. While future licensing requirements, including any licenses imposed on recreational boating, are not expected to be unduly restrictive, they may deter potential customers, thereby reducing our sales. Furthermore, regulations allowing the sale of fuel containing higher levels of ethanol for automobiles, which is not appropriate or intended for use in marine engines, may nonetheless result in increased warranty, service costs, customer dissatisfaction with products, and other claims against the Company if boaters mistakenly use this fuel in marine engines, causing damage to and the degradation of components in their marine engines.Our manufacturing processes involve the use, handling, storage and contracting for recycling or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes. Accordingly, we are subject to regulations regarding these substances, and the misuse or mishandling of such substances could expose us to liabilities, including claims for property, personal injury, or natural resources damages, or fines. We are also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property, including cleanup efforts currently underway. If a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from one of our current or former properties or another location where we have disposed of hazardous materials, we may be held liable for the contamination, regardless of knowledge or whether we were at fault, and the amount of such liability could be material.We are subject to various data protection and privacy laws and regulations in the foreign countries where we operate because we collect, store, process, and use personal information, and we rely on third parties that are not directly under our control to do so as well. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union (EU) went into effect in May 2018 and, although we have implemented plans to comply with the law, it could impose an even greater compliance burden and risk with respect to privacy and data security than prior laws. The EU (through the GDPR) and a growing number of legislative and regulatory bodies elsewhere in the world have adopted consumer notification requirements in the event of unauthorized access to or acquisition of certain types of personal data. These breach notification laws continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. Complying with these obligations could cause us to incur substantial costs and could increase negative publicity surrounding any incident that compromises personal data. Additionally, we are subject to laws governing our relationships with employees, including, but not limited to, employment obligations as a federal contractor and employee wage, hour, and benefits issues, such as pension funding and health care benefits. Compliance with these rules and regulations, and compliance with any changes to current regulations, could increase the cost of our operations.Changes in income tax laws or enforcement could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.Although domestic tax reform legislation in the form of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), signed into law on December 22, 2017, has had an overall positive impact on our financial statements, the impact of the legislation could change as we analyze and apply additional regulations or guidance issued by the government. In addition, other changes in international and domestic tax laws, including the reaction by states to the corporate tax changes in the TCJA, and changes in tax law enforcement, could negatively impact our tax provision, cash flow, and/or tax related balance sheet amounts, including our deferred tax asset values. Changes in U.S. tax law will likely have broader implications, including impacts to the economy, currency markets, inflation environment, 18Table of Contentsconsumer behavior, and/or competitive dynamics, which are difficult to predict, and may positively or negatively impact the Company and our results.Certain activist shareholder actions could cause us to incur expense and hinder execution of our strategy.We actively engage in discussions with our shareholders regarding further strengthening our Company and creating long-term shareholder value. This ongoing dialogue can include certain divisive activist tactics, which can take many forms. Some shareholder activism, including potential proxy contests, could result in substantial costs, such as legal fees and expenses, and divert management’s and our Board’s attention and resources from our businesses and strategic plans. Additionally, public shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future, adversely affect our relationships with dealers, distributors, or customers, make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, and cause our stock price to fluctuate based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business. These risks could adversely affect our business and operating results.Some of our operations are conducted by joint ventures that are not operated solely for our benefit.We share ownership and management responsibilities with jointly owned companies such as BAC and Tohatsu Marine Corporation. These joint ventures may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities, or resources as the Company because they are intended to be operated for the benefit of all co-owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. If such a conflict occurred, it could negatively impact our sales or financial results. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from international sources, which creates additional uncertainty.We intend to continue to expand our international operations and customer base as part of our growth strategy. Sales outside the United States, especially in emerging markets, are subject to various risks, including government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions, foreign currency effects, tariffs, customs duties, inflation, difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems, compliance with international laws, treaties, and regulations, and unexpected changes in regulatory environments, disruptions in distribution, and dependence on foreign personnel and unions, as well as economic and social instability. In addition, there may be tax inefficiencies in repatriating cash from non-U.S. subsidiaries, or tax laws that affect this process may change.  Instability, including, but not limited to, political events, civil unrest, and an increase in criminal activity, in locations where we maintain a significant presence could adversely impact our manufacturing and business operations. Decreased stability poses a risk of business interruption and delays in shipments of materials, components, and finished goods, as well as a risk of decreased local retail demand for our products.  In addition, global political and economic uncertainty and shifts, such as the ongoing negotiations to determine the future terms of the U.K.’s relationship with the EU (Brexit), pose risks of volatility in global markets, which could affect our operations and financial results. Changes in U.S. policy regarding foreign trade or manufacturing may create negative sentiment about the U.S. among non-U.S. customers, employees, or prospective employees, which could adversely affect our business, sales, hiring, and employee retention.  If we continue to expand our business globally, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks, which could materially impact international operations or the business as a whole.Adverse weather conditions and climate events can have a negative effect on marine revenues.Changes in seasonal weather conditions can have a significant effect on our operating and financial results, especially in the marine businesses. Sales of our marine products are typically stronger just before and during spring and summer, and favorable weather during these months generally has had a positive effect on consumer demand. Conversely, unseasonably cool weather, excessive rainfall, or drought conditions during these periods can reduce or change the timing of demand.  Additionally, climate changes, regardless of the cause, resulting in environmental changes including, but not limited to, severe weather, changing sea levels, poor water conditions, or reduced access to water, could disrupt or negatively affect our business.Catastrophic events, including natural and environmental disasters, could have a negative effect on our operations and financial results.Hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, storms, and catastrophic natural or environmental disasters could disrupt our distribution channel, operations, or supply chain and decrease consumer demand.  If a catastrophic event takes place in one of our major sales markets, our sales could be diminished.  Additionally, if such an event occurs near our business locations, manufacturing facilities or key suppliers' facilities, business operations and/or operating systems could be interrupted. We could be uniquely affected by a catastrophic event due to the location of certain of our boat facilities in coastal Florida and the size of the manufacturing operation in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin.19Table of Contents"

BusinessBrunswick Corporation is a Delaware corporation incorporated on December 31, 1907. We are a leading global designer, manufacturer, and marketer of recreation products including marine engines, boats, fitness equipment, and active recreation products. Our engine-related products include: outboard, sterndrive, and inboard engines; trolling motors; propellers; engine control systems; and marine parts and accessories. We make fiberglass pleasure, sport cruiser, sport fishing and center-console, offshore fishing, aluminum and fiberglass fishing, pontoon, utility, deck, inflatable, and heavy-gauge aluminum boats. Our fitness products include cardiovascular and strength training equipment for both the commercial and consumer markets.

In 2017, we continued to successfully execute our growth strategy, investing in new products as well as productivity and efficiency initiatives. We expect to continue our focus on growth in 2018, emphasizing continued product leadership, targeted acquisitions, and other growth-related investments, including using digital technology to improve service offerings. In the longer term, our strategy remains consistent: to design, develop, and introduce high-quality products featuring innovative technology and styling; to distribute products through a model that benefits our partners - dealers and distributors; to provide world-class service to our customers; to develop and maintain low-cost manufacturing processes, and to continually improve productivity and efficiency; to manufacture and distribute products globally with local and regional styling; to continue implementing our capital strategy, which includes maintaining strong cash and liquidity positions, allocating capital to organic growth initiatives and strategic acquisition opportunities, funding pension obligations, and continuing to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases; and to attract and retain skilled employees. These strategic objectives support our plans to grow by expanding our existing businesses. Our primary objective is to enhance shareholder value by achieving returns on investments that exceed our cost of capital. Refer to Note 6 – Segment Information and Note 2 – Discontinued Operations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our segments and discontinued operations, including net sales, operating earnings, and total assets by segment. Marine Engine SegmentThe Marine Engine segment, which had net sales of $2,631.8 million in 2017, consists of the Mercury Marine Group (Mercury Marine). We believe our Marine Engine segment is a world leader in the manufacturing and sale of recreational marine engines and marine parts and accessories.  Mercury Marine manufactures and markets a full range of outboard, sterndrive, and inboard engine and propulsion systems under, among other brand names, the Mercury, Mercury MerCruiser, Mariner, Mercury Racing, and Mercury Diesel brands. In addition, Mercury Marine manufactures and markets parts and accessories under the Quicksilver, Mercury Precision Parts, Mercury Propellers, Attwood, Garelick, Whale, BLA, FulTyme RV, Talamex, Besto, Seachoice, and MotorGuide brand names, including marine electronics and control integration systems, steering systems, instruments, controls, propellers, trolling motors, fuel systems, service parts, and lubricants. Mercury Marine supplies integrated, high-speed diesel propulsion systems to the worldwide recreational and commercial marine markets. To promote advanced propulsion systems with improved handling, performance, and efficiency, Mercury Marine also manufactures and markets advanced boat steering and engine control systems. Mercury Marine's outboard, sterndrive, and inboard engines are sold to independent boat builders, local, state, and foreign governments, and to Brunswick's Boat segment. In addition, Mercury Marine sells outboard engines through a global network of more than 6,000 marine dealers and distributors, specialty marine retailers, and marine service centers.  White River Marine Group, LLC and its subsidiaries (including Tracker and Ranger Boats) is Mercury Marine’s most significant external customer.Mercury Marine manufactures four-stroke outboard engine models ranging from 2.5 to 400 horsepower and two-stroke OptiMax outboard engines, all of which feature Mercury's direct fuel injection (DFI) technology, ranging from 150 to 300 horsepower.  All of these low-emission engines are in compliance with applicable U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requirements.  Mercury Marine's four-stroke outboard engines include Verado, a collection of supercharged outboards ranging from 175 to 400 horsepower, and Mercury Marine's naturally aspirated four-stroke outboards, ranging from 2.5 to 150 horsepower. Mercury Marine and Mercury Racing manufacture inboard and sterndrive engine models ranging from 115 to 1,750 horsepower. Mercury Marine also manufactures two-stroke, non-DFI engines for certain markets outside the United States. In addition, most of Mercury's sterndrive and inboard engines are now available with catalyst exhaust treatment and monitoring systems, and all are compliant with applicable U.S. state and federal environmental regulations.  Mercury also makes engines that comply with global emissions and noise regulations.1Table of ContentsMercury continues to develop and integrate innovative technology to enhance the boating experience, including through Mercury VesselView and VesselView Mobile, a connected propulsion system and mobile application that allow customers to display engine information, speed, trim, and more, joystick controls for multi-engine boats, and Active Trim, an intuitive, hands-free system that continually adjusts engine trim based on changes in boat speed to improve performance, fuel economy, and ease of operation.  Mercury Marine produces its gasoline sterndrive and outboard engines domestically in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, with outboard engines also produced internationally in China and Japan. Mercury Marine manufactures 40, 50 and 60 horsepower four-stroke outboard engines in a facility in China, and produces smaller outboard engines in Japan pursuant to a joint venture with its partner, Tohatsu Corporation. Mercury Marine sources engine components from a global supply base and manufactures additional engine component parts at its Fond du Lac facility and plants in Florida and Mexico. Mercury Marine also operates a remanufacturing business for engines and service parts in Wisconsin.  In addition, Mercury Marine has an equity ownership interest in Bella-Veneet Oy, which manufactures boats under the brand names Bella, Flipper, and Aquador in Finland.  For the seventh consecutive year, the Wisconsin Sustainable Business Council awarded Mercury a “Green Masters” designation, a program measuring a broad range of sustainability issues ranging from energy and water conservation to waste management, community outreach, and education. The designation highlights Mercury's commitment to sustainability as discussed in its 2017 Sustainability Report, detailing specific goals related to energy, environment, products, and people, all of which goals Mercury has met or exceeded. In addition to its fuel-efficient products, water, and energy conservation programs, Mercury installed a new solar panel roof at its European headquarters located in Petit-Rechain, Belgium, in 2017. Mercury's parts and accessories distribution and products businesses include: Land 'N' Sea, Kellogg Marine Supply, Lankhorst Taselaar, Payne's Marine, BLA, Attwood, Garelick Mfg. Co., and Whale. These businesses are leading manufacturers and distributors of marine parts and accessories throughout North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific, offering same-day or next-day delivery service to a broad array of marine service facilities. On September 1, 2017, Brunswick acquired 100 percent of Lankhorst Taselaar B.V. (Lankhorst Taselaar), a leading marine parts and accessories distribution company based in the Netherlands and Germany. The acquisition augments the marine parts and accessories businesses through a broader product line and an expanded distribution network.Intercompany sales to Brunswick's Boat segment represented approximately 10 percent of Mercury Marine's sales in 2017. Domestic demand for the Marine Engine segment's products is seasonal, with sales generally highest in the second calendar quarter of the year. Boat SegmentThe Boat segment consists of the Brunswick Boat Group (Boat Group), which manufactures and markets the following types of boats: fiberglass pleasure, sport cruiser, sport fishing and center-console, offshore fishing, aluminum and fiberglass fishing, pontoon, utility, deck, inflatable, and heavy-gauge aluminum. We believe that the Boat Group, which had net sales of $1,103.0 million during 2017, is a world leader in the manufacturing and sale of pleasure motorboats. The Boat Group manages Brunswick's boat brands; evaluates and optimizes the Boat segment's boat portfolio; promotes recreational boating services and activities to enhance the consumer experience and dealer profitability; and speeds the introduction of new technologies into boat manufacturing and design processes. The Boat Group includes the following boat brands: Bayliner sport cruisers, runabouts, and Heyday wake boats; Boston Whaler fiberglass offshore boats; Lund fiberglass fishing boats; Crestliner, Cypress Cay, Harris, Lowe, Lund, and Princecraft aluminum fishing, utility, pontoon boats, and deck boats; and Thunder Jet heavy-gauge aluminum boats. The Boat Group also includes a commercial and governmental sales unit that sells products to commercial customers, as well as to the United States government and state, local, and foreign governments. The Boat Group procures most of its outboard engines, gasoline sterndrive engines, and gasoline inboard engines from Brunswick's Marine Engine segment.  The Boat Group also includes several Brunswick boat brands based in Europe and Asia-Pacific, such as Quicksilver, Uttern, and Rayglass (including Protector and Legend), which are typically equipped with Mercury Marine engines and often include other parts and accessories supplied by Mercury Marine. The Boat Group operates manufacturing facilities in Florida, Indiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Washington, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand, and Portugal, and owns an inactive manufacturing facility in North Carolina. The Boat Group utilizes several 2Table of Contentscontract manufacturing facilities in Poland and Croatia.The Boat Group sells its products through a global network of more than 2,000 dealers and distributors, with some dealer locations carrying more than one of Brunswick's boat brands. Sales to the Boat Group's largest dealer, MarineMax, Inc., which has multiple locations and carries a number of the Boat Group's product lines, represented approximately 16 percent of Boat Group sales in 2017. Domestic demand for pleasure boats is seasonal, with sales generally highest in the second calendar quarter of the year.Fitness SegmentOur Fitness segment is comprised of the Fitness division (Fitness), which designs, manufactures, and markets a full line of reliable, high-quality cardiovascular fitness equipment (including treadmills, total body cross-trainers, stair climbers, and stationary exercise bicycles) and strength-training equipment under the Life Fitness, Hammer Strength, Cybex, Indoor Cycling Group, and SCIFIT brands.  The Fitness segment also includes our active recreation business, including billiards tables, accessories, and game room furniture. We believe that our Fitness segment, which had net sales of $1,033.7 million during 2017, is the world's largest manufacturer of commercial fitness equipment and a leading manufacturer of high-quality consumer fitness equipment. Fitness' commercial customers include health clubs, corporations, schools and universities, hotels, professional and collegiate sports teams, retirement and assisted living facilities, and the military and governmental agencies. Planet Fitness Inc. is the segment's most significant customer. Fitness makes commercial sales through its direct sales force, domestic dealers, and international distributors.  Consumer products are available at specialty retailers, select mass merchants, sporting goods stores, through international distributors, and on the Life Fitness website.The billiards business was established in 1845 and is Brunswick's heritage business. The billiards business designs and markets billiards tables, table tennis tables, and Air Hockey tables, as well as game room furniture and related accessories, under the Brunswick and Contender brands. The Fitness segment's principal manufacturing facilities are located in Illinois, Kentucky, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Wisconsin, and Hungary, with principal third party contract manufacturing partners in China and Taiwan. Fitness distributes its products worldwide from regional warehouses and production facilities. Demand for Fitness products is seasonal, with sales generally highest in the fourth quarter of the year.Discontinued OperationsOn December 5, 2017, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to exit its Sea Ray businesses, including the Meridian brand, as a result of, among other things, a change in strategic direction and a review of the expected future cash flows, market conditions, and business trends. As a result, these businesses, which were previously reported in the Company's Boat segment, are being reported as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented.On July 17, 2014, we entered into an agreement to sell our retail bowling business to AMF Bowling Centers, Inc. (AMF).  In connection with our decision to sell the bowling centers, we also announced our intention to divest our bowling products business.  The billiards business, which was previously reported in the Bowling & Billiards segment, remains part of the Company and is being reported in the Fitness segment for all periods presented.  On September 18, 2014, we completed the sale of our retail bowling business to AMF. On May 22, 2015, we completed the sale of our bowling products business to BlueArc Capital Management L.L.C.  As a result of these actions, these businesses, which were previously recorded in the Bowling & Billiards segment, are reported as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented.  We do not have or anticipate having any significant continuing involvement or continuing cash flows associated with these businesses. Refer to Note 2 – Discontinued Operations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations.3Table of ContentsFinancial ServicesThrough our Brunswick Financial Services Corporation subsidiary, we own a 49 percent interest in a joint venture, Brunswick Acceptance Company, LLC (BAC). Under the terms of the joint venture agreement, BAC provides secured wholesale inventory floorplan financing to our boat and engine dealers. A subsidiary of Wells Fargo & Company owns the remaining 51 percent.Effective July 31, 2015, the joint venture was extended through December 31, 2019. The joint venture agreement contains provisions allowing for the renewal of the agreement or purchase of the other party's interest in the joint venture at the end of its term. Alternatively, either partner may terminate the agreement at the end of its term. In June 2016, the parties amended the joint venture agreement to adjust a financial covenant that was conformed to the maximum leverage ratio test contained in our revolving credit facility described in Note 16 – Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Additionally, we offer financial services through Brunswick Product Protection Corporation, which provides marine dealers the opportunity to offer extended product warranties to retail customers, and through Blue Water Dealer Services, Inc., which provides retail financial services to marine dealers. Each company allows us to offer a more complete line of financial services to our boat and marine engine dealers and their customers. Refer to Note 10 – Financial Services in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our financial services. DistributionWe utilize independent distributors, dealers, and retailers (Dealers) for the majority of our boat sales and significant portions of our sales of marine engine, fitness, and billiards products. We have over 16,000 Dealers serving our business segments worldwide. Our marine Dealers typically carry one or more of the following product categories: boats, engines, and related parts and accessories. We own Land 'N' Sea, Kellogg Marine Supply, and Payne's Marine Group, which comprise the primary parts and accessories distribution platforms for our Marine Engine segment in North America. We believe that these businesses, collectively, are the leading distributors of marine parts and accessories throughout North America, with 20  distribution warehouses located throughout the United States and Canada offering same-day or next-day delivery service to a broad array of marine service facilities and Dealers. We also believe we are the leading parts and accessories distributor in the Asia-Pacific region. Our Dealers are independent companies or proprietors that range in size from small, family-owned businesses to a large, publicly-traded corporation with substantial revenues and multiple locations. Some Dealers sell our products exclusively, while a majority also carry competitors' and complementary products. We partner with our boat dealer network to improve quality, service, distribution, and delivery of parts and accessories to enhance the boating customer's experience. Demand for a significant portion of our products is seasonal, and a number of our Dealers are relatively small and/or highly-leveraged. As a result, many Dealers secure floor plan financing from BAC or other third party finance companies, enabling them to provide stable channels for our products. In addition to the financing BAC offers, we may also provide our Dealers with incentive programs, loan guarantees, inventory repurchase commitments, and financing receivable arrangements, under which we are obligated to repurchase inventory or receivables from a finance company in the event of a Dealer's default. We believe that these arrangements are in our best interest; however, these arrangements expose us to credit and business risk. Our business units, along with BAC, maintain active credit operations to manage this financial exposure, and we continually seek opportunities to sustain and improve the financial health of our various distribution channel partners. Refer to Note 8 – Financing Receivables and Note 13 – Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these arrangements.TechnologyAs part of our continuing effort to provide customer value, Brunswick has invested in a variety of technology solutions to further improve customer interaction with our products. In 2017, we entered into a joint venture with TechNexus Holdings, LLC to identify and incubate innovative start-up ventures with strategic marine and fitness applications to help drive long-term growth. In addition, in 2018 we launched Nautic-ON, a smart technology and service system that helps boaters stay connected with their boats remotely, monitoring engine status, battery and bilge pump, and other advanced features. Fitness is focused on allowing digital partners to become a key part of the fitness ecosystem, as well as the development of digital solutions focused on driving improved customer outcomes and creating business intelligence, personalized experiences, 4Table of Contentsand commercial impact. Technology within the Fitness segment includes the LFconnect mobile application, which allows smart devices to interact with compatible Life Fitness equipment and track progress, personalize workouts, and provide motivation and engagement.International OperationsNon-U.S. sales are set forth in Note 6 – Segment Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and are also included in the table below, which details our non-U.S. sales by region:(in millions)2017 2016 2015Europe$591.8 $555.0 $490.7Asia-Pacific398.6 352.7 302.5Canada293.0 255.5 253.3Latin America159.6 144.0 169.3Africa & Middle East94.1 84.5 89.6Total$1,537.1 $1,391.7 $1,305.4Total International Sales as a Percentage of Net Sales34% 34% 35%We transact a portion of our sales in non-U.S. markets in local currencies, while a meaningful portion of our product costs are denominated in U.S. dollars as a result of our U.S. manufacturing operations. As a result, the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar affects the financial results of our non-U.S. operations. Marine Engine segment non-U.S. sales represented approximately 50 percent of our non-U.S. sales in 2017. The segment's principal non-U.S. operations include the following:•Distribution, sales, service, and applications engineering offices in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and Singapore; •Sales or representative offices in Dubai, Finland, France, Italy, Japan, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and Switzerland; •    A component manufacturing facility in Mexico;•An outboard engine assembly plant in Suzhou, China; •    An outboard engine assembly plant operated by a joint venture in Japan; and•   A parts and accessories manufacturing facility in Northern Ireland.Boat segment non-U.S. sales comprised approximately 19 percent of our non-U.S. sales in 2017.  The Boat Group manufactures or assembles a portion of its products in Canada, Mexico, New Zealand, and Portugal, as well as in boat plants owned and operated by third parties in Croatia and Poland that perform contract manufacturing for us, which are sold mostly in international markets through Dealers. The Boat Group has sales or import offices in Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, and Sweden. Fitness segment non-U.S. sales comprised approximately 31 percent of our non-U.S. sales in 2017. Fitness sells its products worldwide and has sales and distribution centers in Brazil, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain, and the United Kingdom. The Fitness segment manufactures strength-training equipment and select lines of cardiovascular equipment in Hungary for its international markets, and has relationships with third-party contract manufacturing partners in China and Taiwan. Raw Materials and SuppliesWe purchase a wide variety of raw materials from our supplier base, including commodities such as aluminum, resins, oil, and steel, as well as product parts and components, such as engine blocks and boat windshields. The prices for these raw materials, parts, and components fluctuate depending on market conditions. Significant increases in the cost of such materials would raise our production costs, which could reduce profitability if we did not recoup the increased costs through higher product prices. As our manufacturing operations continued to raise production levels in 2017, our need for raw materials and supplies also increased.  During 2017, we experienced some shortages or delayed delivery of certain materials, parts, and supplies essential to our manufacturing operations, although such shortages did not materially impact operations. We have addressed and will continue to address this issue by identifying alternative suppliers, working to secure adequate inventories of critical supplies, and continually monitoring the capabilities of our supplier base. In 2018, we anticipate our suppliers will need to increase their manufacturing capacity and investments to meet the rising demand for their products and, in many cases, may need to hire additional workers in order to fulfill the orders placed by us and other customers. 5Table of Contents We also continue to expand our global procurement operations to better leverage purchasing power across our divisions and to improve supply chain and cost efficiencies. We mitigate commodity price risk on certain raw material purchases by entering into fixed priced contracts or derivatives to mitigate exposure related to changes in commodity prices. Intellectual PropertyWe have, and continue to obtain, patent rights covering certain features of our products and processes. By law, our patent rights, which consist of patents and patent licenses, have limited lives and expire periodically. We believe that our patent rights are important to our competitive position in all of our business segments.  Our trademark rights have indefinite lives, and many are well known to the public and are considered to be valuable assets. Most of our intellectual property is owned by U.S. entities.  In the Marine Engine segment, patent rights principally relate to features of outboard engines and inboard-outboard drives, hybrid drives, and pod drives, including: die-cast powerheads; cooling and exhaust systems; drivetrain, clutch, and gearshift mechanisms; boat/engine mountings; shock-absorbing tilt mechanisms; ignition systems; propellers; marine vessel control systems; fuel and oil injection systems; supercharged engines; outboard mid-section structures; segmented cowls; hydraulic trim, tilt and steering; screw compressor charge air cooling systems; a range of proprietary metal alloys; and airflow silencers. In the Boat segment, patent rights principally relate to processes for manufacturing fiberglass hulls, decks, and components for boat products, as well as patent rights related to boat features and components. In the Fitness segment, patent rights principally relate to fitness equipment designs and components, including patents covering internal processes, programming functions, displays, design features and styling, as well as billiards table designs and components. The following are our principal trademarks: Marine Engine Segment:  Attwood, Axius, FulTyme RV, Garelick, Kellogg Marine Supply, Land 'N' Sea, Mariner, MerCruiser, Mercury, Mercury Marine, Mercury Precision Parts, Mercury Propellers, Mercury Racing, MotorGuide, OptiMax, Quicksilver, Seachoice, SeaPro, SmartCraft, Sport-Jet, Swivl-Eze, Talamex, Valiant, Verado, Whale, and Zeus.Boat Segment:  Bayliner, Boston Whaler, Crestliner, Cypress Cay, Harris, Heyday, Lowe, Lund, Master Dealer, Meridian, Princecraft, Protector, Quicksilver, Rayglass, Sea Ray, Thunder Jet, and Uttern.Fitness Segment:  Air Hockey, Brunswick, Contender, Cybex, Flex Deck, Gold Crown, Hammer Strength, Indoor Cycling Group, Lifecycle, Life Fitness, and SCIFIT.Competitive Conditions and PositionWe believe that we have a reputation for quality in each of our highly competitive lines of business. We compete in various markets by: utilizing efficient production techniques; developing and strengthening our leading brands; developing and promoting innovative technological advancements; undertaking effective marketing, advertising, and sales efforts; providing high-quality, innovative products at competitive prices; and offering extensive aftermarket products. Strong competition exists in each of our product groups, but no single enterprise competes with us in all product groups. In each product area, competitors range in size from large, highly-diversified companies to small, single-product businesses. We also indirectly compete with businesses that offer alternative leisure products or activities. The following summarizes our competitive position in each segment: Marine Engine Segment: We believe the Marine Engine segment is a world leader in the manufacture and sale of recreational and commercial marine engines and marine parts and accessories. The marine engine market is highly competitive among several major international companies that comprise the majority of the market, including Japanese-based outboard engine manufacturers, as well as several smaller companies including Chinese manufacturers. Competitive advantage in this segment is a function of product features, technological leadership, quality, service, pricing, performance, manufacturing capabilities, depth of product portfolio, intuitive product controls, and durability, along with effective promotion and distribution. Boat Segment: We believe that the Boat segment is a world leader in the manufacture and sale of pleasure motorboats. There are several major manufacturers of pleasure and offshore fishing boats, along with hundreds of smaller manufacturers. 6Table of ContentsConsequently, this business is both highly competitive and highly fragmented. In all of our boat operations, we compete on the basis of product features, technology, quality, brand strength, dealer service, pricing, performance, value, durability and styling, along with effective promotion and distribution. Fitness Segment: We believe we are the world's largest manufacturer of commercial fitness equipment and a leading manufacturer of high-quality consumer fitness equipment and billiards tables. The fitness equipment industry is highly competitive among several major international companies that comprise the majority of the market, as well as many smaller manufacturers, which creates a highly fragmented, competitive landscape. Many of our fitness equipment offerings include industry-leading product features, and we place significant emphasis on introducing innovative fitness equipment to the market. Competitive focus is also placed on product quality, technology, service, pricing, state-of-the-art biomechanics, connectivity and customer solutions, and effective promotional activities.  The billiards industry continues to experience competitive pressure from low-cost billiards manufacturers outside the United States.   Research and DevelopmentWe strive to improve our competitive position in all of our segments by continuously investing in research and development to drive innovation in our products and manufacturing technologies. Our research and development investments support the introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products. Research and development expenses were 3.1 percent, 3.2 percent and 3.0 percent of net sales in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Research and development expenses by segment are discussed in Note 6 – Segment Information.

The Company's operations and financial results are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including those described below, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock.Worldwide economic conditions significantly affect our industries and businesses, and economic decline can materially impact our financial results.In times of economic uncertainty and contraction, consumers tend to have less discretionary income and to defer expenditures for discretionary items, which adversely affects our financial performance, especially in the marine businesses.  Although we have expanded the portions of our portfolio that are less susceptible to economic cycles, a portion of the business remains cyclical and sensitive to personal spending levels.  Although general economic conditions in certain international markets, including Latin America and Canada, are improving, they continue to be challenging with respect to weak currencies and commodity market impacts.Deterioration in general economic conditions that in turn diminishes consumer confidence or discretionary income may reduce our sales, or we may decide to lower pricing for our products, thus adversely affecting our financial results, including increasing the potential for future impairment charges. Further, most of our products are used for recreation, and consumers’ limited discretionary income in times of economic hardship may be diverted to other activities that occupy their time, such as other forms of recreation, religious, cultural, or community activities.  We cannot predict the timing or continued strength of global economies, either worldwide or in the specific markets in which we compete.  Failure to successfully implement our strategic plan and growth initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.Our ability to continue generating strong cash flow and profits depends partly on the sustained successful execution of our strategic plan and growth initiatives, including optimizing our business portfolio, making acquisitions, and expanding into new adjacent markets and customers. To address risks associated with our plan and growth initiatives, we have established processes to regularly review, manage, and modify our plans, and we believe we have appropriate oversight to monitor initiatives and their impact. Our strategic plan and growth initiatives require significant capital investment and management attention, however, which could result in the diversion of these resources from the core business and other business issues and opportunities. Additionally, any new initiative is subject to certain risks, including customer acceptance, competition, the ability to manufacture products on schedule and to specification, the ability to create the necessary supply chain, and/or the ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel.  There is no assurance that we will be able to develop and successfully implement our strategic plan and growth initiatives in a manner that achieves our strategic objectives.An inability to make targeted acquisitions or failure to successfully integrate newly acquired businesses could negatively impact financial results.Our growth initiatives include making strategic acquisitions, which depend on the availability of suitable targets at acceptable terms and our ability to complete the deals. In order to manage our acquisition strategy, we conduct rigorous due diligence, involve various functions, and continually review our strategy and target acquisitions, all of which we believe mitigates our acquisition risks. However, we cannot assure that acquisitions will be consummated or that, if consummated, they will be successful.  Acquisitions pose risks such as our ability to project and evaluate market demand, maximize potential synergies and cost savings; make accurate accounting estimates; and achieve anticipated business objectives. As we continue to grow, in part, through acquisitions, our success depends on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these risks.  If acquired businesses do not achieve projected results, our growth may be limited and our results adversely affected.  In addition, acquisitions present integration risks, including that the acquisition may:•disrupt operations in core, adjacent, or acquired businesses; •require more time than anticipated to be fully integrated into Company operations and systems; •create more costs than projected; •divert management attention; •create the potential of losing customer, supplier, or other critical business relationships; and •pose difficulties retaining employees.  If we fail to timely and successfully integrate new businesses into existing operations, we may see higher production costs, lost sales or otherwise diminished earnings and financial results.8Table of ContentsThere can be no assurance that strategic divestitures will provide business benefits.As part of our strategy, we continuously evaluate our portfolio of businesses. We have previously and may in the future make changes to our portfolio, which may be material. For example, on December 5, 2017, the Company announced our intention to sell the Sea Ray businesses, including the Meridian brand. Divestitures involve risks, including difficulties in the separation of operations, services, products and personnel, disruption in our operations or businesses, finding a suitable purchaser, the diversion of management's attention from our other businesses, the potential loss of key employees, adverse effects on relationships with our dealer or supplier partners or their businesses, the erosion of employee morale or customer confidence, and the retention of contingent liabilities related to the divested business. If we do not successfully manage the risks associated with divestitures, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected as the potential strategic benefits may not be realized or may take longer to realize than expected. Changes in currency exchange rates can adversely affect our results.Some of our sales are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. Consequently, a strong U.S. dollar may adversely affect reported revenues. We have hedging programs in place to reduce our risk to currency fluctuations; however, we cannot hedge against all currency risks, especially over the long term.  We maintain a portion of our cost structure in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which partially mitigates the impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar.  This includes manufacturing operations for boats in Europe and Canada, fitness equipment in Europe, and smaller outboard engines manufactured and purchased from our joint venture in Japan.  We also continue to evaluate the supply chain and cost structure for opportunities to further mitigate foreign currency risks.  We sell products manufactured in the U.S. into certain international markets in U.S. dollars, including to Canada, Europe, and Latin America. Demand for our products in these markets may be diminished by a strengthening U.S. dollar, or we may need to lower prices to remain competitive.  Some of our competitors with cost positions based outside the U.S., including Asian-based outboard engine and fitness equipment manufacturers, European-based large fiberglass boat manufacturers, and a European-based fitness equipment manufacturer, may have an improved cost position due to a strengthening U.S. dollar, which could result in pricing pressures on our products.  These factors existed throughout 2016 and 2017, but we do not believe they resulted in a material change in our competitive position.Fiscal concerns may negatively impact worldwide credit conditions and adversely affect our industries, businesses, and financial condition.Fiscal policy could have a material adverse impact on worldwide economic conditions, the financial markets, and availability of credit and, consequently, may negatively affect our industries, businesses, and overall financial condition. Customers often finance purchases of our products, particularly boats. Credit market conditions, while improved, are still less favorable overall than those in existence prior to the global recession in 2008. While interest rates remain relatively low and credit availability is adequate to support demand, there are fewer lenders, tighter underwriting and loan approval criteria, and greater down payment requirements.  If credit conditions worsen, and adversely affect the ability of customers to finance potential purchases at acceptable terms and interest rates, it could result in a decrease in sales or delay improvement in sales.Dealer or distributor inability to secure adequate access to capital could adversely affect our sales.Our dealers require adequate liquidity to finance their operations, including purchasing our products. Dealers are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could unfavorably affect their liquidity positions, including, among other things, continued access to adequate financing sources on a timely basis on reasonable terms. These financing sources are vital to our ability to sell products through our distribution network, particularly to boat and engine dealers.  Entities affiliated with Wells Fargo & Company, including BAC, the Company’s 49 percent owned joint venture, finance a significant portion of our boat and engine sales to dealers through floorplan financing to marine dealers. Many factors continue to influence the availability and terms of financing that our dealer floorplan financing providers offer, including: •their ability to access certain capital markets, such as the securitization and the commercial paper markets, and to fund their operations in a cost effective manner; •the performance of their overall credit portfolios; •their willingness to accept the risks associated with lending to marine dealers; and •the overall creditworthiness of those dealers.  9Table of ContentsOur sales could be adversely affected if financing terms change unfavorably or if BAC were to be terminated. This could require dealers to find alternative sources of financing, including our direct financing to dealers, which could require additional capital to fund the associated receivables.Our financial results could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective distribution.We rely on third-party dealers and distributors to sell most of our products, particularly in the marine businesses. Maintaining a reliable network of dealers is essential to our success. We face competition from other manufacturers in attracting and retaining distributors and independent boat dealers. A significant deterioration in the number or effectiveness of our dealers and distributors could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.Although at present we believe dealer health to be generally favorable, weakening demand for marine products could hurt our dealers’ financial performance. In particular, reduced cash flow from decreases in sales and tightening credit markets may impair dealers' ability to fund operations. Inability to fund operations can force dealers to cease business, and we may be unable to obtain alternate distribution in the vacated market. An inability to obtain alternate distribution could unfavorably affect our net sales through reduced market presence. If economic conditions deteriorate, we anticipate that dealer failures or voluntary market exits would increase, especially if overall retail demand materially declines. Finally, labor disruption at major ports and shipping hubs around the world may adversely affect our ability to transport raw materials to our facilities and products to our distributors and end-use customers, potentially resulting in increased transportation costs and lost sales.Adverse economic, credit, and capital market conditions could have a negative impact on our financial results.We do not frequently rely on short-term capital markets to meet our working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, pay dividends, or fund employee benefit programs; however, we do maintain short-term borrowing facilities that can be used to meet these capital requirements. In addition, over the long term, we may determine that it is necessary to access the capital markets to refinance existing long-term indebtedness or for other initiatives.Adverse global economic conditions, market volatility, and regulatory uncertainty could lead to volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets. This could adversely affect our ability to access capital and credit markets or increase the cost to do so, which could have a negative impact on our business, financial results and competitive position.Loss of key customers could harm our business.In each segment, we have important relationships with key customers. From time to time, contracts with these customers come up for renewal, including a contract with a large Fitness segment customer in the first half of 2018. We cannot be certain we will renew such contracts, or renew them on favorable terms. If we lose a key customer, or a significant portion of its business, we could be adversely affected. In addition, certain customers could try to negotiate more favorable pricing of our products, which could depress earnings. In an effort to mitigate the risk associated with reliance on key customer accounts, we continually monitor such relationships and maintain a complete and competitive product lineup. Inventory reductions by major dealers, retailers, and independent boat builders could adversely affect our financial results.The Company and our dealers, retailers, and other distributors could decide to reduce the number of units they hold, particularly if demand trails forecasted levels or if new product introductions are expected to replace older products. Such efforts tend to result in wholesale sales reductions in excess of retail sales reductions and would likely result in lower production levels of our products, causing lower rates of absorption of fixed costs in our manufacturing facilities and lower margins. While we continue to work to keep dealer inventories at appropriate levels, potential inventory reductions remain a risk to our future sales and results of operations.We may be required to repurchase inventory or accounts of certain dealers.We have agreements with certain third-party finance companies to provide financing to our customers, enabling them to purchase our products. In connection with these agreements, we may either have obligations to repurchase our products from the finance company, or may have recourse obligations to the finance company on the dealer’s receivables. These obligations may be triggered if our dealers default on their debt obligations to the finance companies.Our maximum contingent obligation to repurchase inventory and our maximum contingent recourse obligations on customer receivables are less than the total balances of dealer financings outstanding under these programs, because our obligations under certain of these arrangements are subject to caps, or are limited based on the age of product. Our risk related to these arrangements 10Table of Contentsis mitigated by the proceeds we receive on the resale of repurchased product to other dealers, or by recoveries on receivables purchased under the recourse obligations.Our inventory repurchase obligations relate primarily to the inventory floorplan credit facilities of our boat and engine dealers. Our actual historical repurchase experience related to these arrangements has been substantially less than our maximum contractual obligations. If dealers file for bankruptcy or cease operations, however, we could incur losses associated with the repurchase of our products.  In addition, as the repurchases may be triggered by dealer bankruptcies, our net sales and earnings may be unfavorably affected as a result of reduced market coverage and the associated decline in sales.Declines in marine industry demand could cause an increase in future repurchase activity, or could require us to incur losses in excess of established reserves. In addition, our cash flow and loss experience could be adversely affected if repurchased inventory is not successfully distributed to other dealers in a timely manner, or if the recovery rate on the resale of the product declines.  The finance companies could require changes in repurchase or recourse terms that would result in an increase in our contractual contingent obligations.Our operations are dependent on our ability to attract and retain adequate skilled labor and on the successful implementation of succession plans for key contributors.Much of our future success depends on, among other factors, our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, including executives and skilled labor. If we are not successful in these efforts, we may be unable to meet our operating goals and plans, which may impact our financial results. With unemployment rates at low levels in many of the geographic areas in which we manufacture or distribute goods, availability of skilled hourly workers is critical to our operations. In order to manage this risk, we continuously monitor and make improvements to wages and benefit programs, as well as develop and improve recruiting and training programs to attract and retain an experienced and skilled workforce. In addition, we perform an annual review of management succession plans with the Board of Directors, including reviewing executive officer and other important positions to substantially mitigate the risk associated with key contributor transitions. Our financial results may be adversely affected by increased costs, disruption of supply, or defects in raw materials, parts, and product components we buy from third-party suppliers.We rely on third parties to supply raw materials used in the manufacturing process, including oil, aluminum, copper, steel, and resins, as well as product parts and components.  The prices for these raw materials, parts, and components fluctuate depending on market conditions and, in some instances, commodity prices. Substantial increases in the prices of raw materials, parts, and components would increase our operating costs, and could reduce our profitability if we are unable to recoup the increased costs through higher product prices. Similarly, if a critical supplier were to close its operations, cease manufacturing, or otherwise fail to deliver an essential component necessary to our manufacturing operations, that could detrimentally affect our ability to manufacture and sell our products, resulting in an interruption in business operations and/or a loss of sales. In addition, some components used in our manufacturing processes, including certain engine components, furniture, upholstery, and boat windshields, are available from a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers. Operational and financial difficulties that these or other suppliers may face in the future could adversely affect their ability to supply us with the parts and components we need, which could significantly disrupt our operations. It may be difficult to find a replacement supplier for a limited or sole source raw material, part, or component without significant delay or on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, an uncorrected defect or supplier's variation in a raw material, part, or component, either unknown to us or incompatible with our manufacturing process, could jeopardize our ability to manufacture products.  Some additional supply risks that could disrupt our operations, impair our ability to deliver products to customers, and negatively affect our financial results include: •financial pressures on our suppliers due to a weakening economy or unfavorable conditions in other end markets; •a deterioration of our relationships with suppliers;•events such as natural disasters, power outages or labor strikes; or•supplier manufacturing constraints and investment requirements.These risks are exacerbated in the case of single-source suppliers, and the exclusive supplier of a key component potentially could exert significant bargaining power over price, quality, warranty claims, or other terms.We continue to increase production; consequently, our need for raw materials and supplies continues to increase. Our suppliers must be prepared to ramp up operations and, in many cases, hire additional workers and/or expand capacity in order to fulfill our orders and those of other customers. Cost increases, defects, or sustained interruptions in the supply of raw materials, parts, or 11Table of Contentscomponents due to delayed start-up periods our suppliers experience as they increase production efforts create risks to our operations and financial results. The Company experienced periodic supply shortages in 2017. We continue to address these issues by identifying alternative suppliers for key materials and components, working to secure adequate inventories of critical supplies, and continually monitoring the capabilities of our supplier base. In the future, however, we may experience shortages, delayed delivery, and/or increased prices for key materials, parts, and supplies that are essential to our manufacturing operations.Higher energy and fuel costs can affect our results.Higher energy and fuel costs increase operating expenses at our manufacturing facilities and the cost of shipping products to customers. In addition, increases in energy costs can adversely affect the pricing and availability of petroleum-based raw materials such as resins and foam that are used in many of our marine products. Higher fuel prices may also have an adverse effect on demand for our marine parts and accessories businesses, as they increase the cost of boat ownership and possibly affect product use.Our success depends upon the continued strength of our brands.We believe that our brands, including Mercury Marine, Life Fitness, Boston Whaler, and Lund, significantly contribute to our success, and that maintaining and enhancing these brands is important to expanding our customer base. A failure to adequately promote and protect our brands could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Further, in connection with the divestiture of the bowling businesses, we licensed certain trademarks and servicemarks, including use of the name “Brunswick,” to the acquiring companies. Our reputation may be adversely affected by the purchasers' inappropriate use of the marks or of the name Brunswick, including potential negative publicity, loss of confidence, or other damage to our image due to this licensed use.   Either inadequate intellectual property protection that could allow others to use our technologies and impair our ability to compete, or failure to successfully defend against patent infringement claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.We regard much of the technology underlying our products as proprietary. We rely on a combination of patents, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws; employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements; and other contracts to establish and protect our technology and other intellectual property rights. However, we remain subject to risks, including:•the steps we take to protect our proprietary technology may be inadequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology;•third parties may independently develop similar technology;•agreements containing protections may be breached or terminated;•we may not have adequate remedies for breaches; •existing patent, trademark, copyright, and trade secret laws may afford limited protection;•a third party could copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization; or•we may be required to litigate to enforce our intellectual property rights, and we may not be successful.Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult, particularly outside the U.S., and litigating intellectual property claims may result in substantial cost and divert management’s attention.  In addition, we may be required to defend our products against patent or other intellectual property infringement claims or litigation. In addition to defense expenses and costs, we may not prevail in such cases, forcing us to seek licenses or royalty arrangements from third parties, which we may not be able to obtain on reasonable terms, or subjecting us to an order or requirement to stop manufacturing, using, selling, or distributing products that included challenged intellectual property, which could harm our business and financial results.We have a fixed cost base that can affect our profitability in a declining sales environment.The fixed cost levels of operating production facilities can put pressure on profit margins when sales and production decline. We have maintained discipline over our fixed cost base during the economic recovery; however, our profitability is dependent, in part, on our ability to spread fixed costs over an increasing number of products sold and shipped, and if we are required to reduce our rate of production, gross margins could be negatively affected if we are unable to lower fixed costs accordingly.  Consequently, decreased demand or the need to reduce inventories can lower our ability to absorb fixed costs and materially impact our results.Successfully managing the expansion of our manufacturing footprint is critical to our operating and financial results.Over the past five years, we have made strategic capital investments in capacity expansion activities to successfully capture growth opportunities and enhance product offerings. Recently, we initiated or completed expansion activities at our facilities in Edgewater, Florida; Lebanon, Missouri; Owatonna, Minnesota; Fond du Lac, Wisconsin; and Vila Nova de Cerveira, Portugal. 12Table of ContentsWe must carefully manage these capital improvement projects and expansions to ensure they meet cost targets, comply with applicable environmental, safety, and other regulations, and uphold high-quality workmanship.  Moving production to a different plant or expanding capacity at an existing facility involves risks, including difficulties initiating production within the cost and timeframe estimated, supplying product to customers when expected, integrating new products, and attracting sufficient skilled workers to handle additional production demands. If we fail to meet these objectives, it could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand for products and increase the cost of production versus projections, both of which could result in a significant adverse impact on operating and financial results.  Additionally, plants experiencing demand increases may face manufacturing inefficiencies, additional expenses, including higher wages, and cost inefficiencies, which could exceed projections and negatively impact financial results.Our business operations could be negatively impacted by an outage or breach of our information technology systems or a cybersecurity event.We manage our global business operations through a variety of information technology (IT) systems which we continually enhance to increase efficiency and security. We depend on these systems for commercial transactions, customer interactions, manufacturing, branding, employee tracking, and other applications. Some of the systems are based on legacy technology and operate with a minimal level of available support, and recent acquisitions using other systems have added to the complexity of our IT infrastructure. We are working to upgrade, streamline, and integrate these systems and have invested in strategies to prevent a failure or breach but, like those of other companies, our systems are susceptible to outages due to natural disasters, power loss, computer viruses, security breaches, hardware or software vulnerabilities, and similar events.  If a legacy system or another of the Company's key systems were to fail or if our IT systems were unable to communicate effectively, this could result in missed or delayed sales or lost opportunities for cost reduction or efficient cash management.  We exchange information with hundreds of trading partners across all aspects of our commercial operations.  A breakdown, outage, malicious intrusion, random attack, or other disruption of communications could result in erroneous transactions or loss of reputation and confidence. We have numerous e-commerce and e-marketing portals and our systems may contain personal information of customers or employees; therefore, we must continue to be diligent in protecting against malicious cyber attacks.   If our security measures are breached or fail, unauthorized persons may be able to obtain access to or acquire personal data. Depending on the nature of the information compromised, we may also have obligations to notify consumers and/or employees about the incident, and we may need to provide some form of remedy, such as a subscription to a credit monitoring service, for the individuals affected by the incident. A successful breach could result in a disruption of services, fraudulent transactions, or disclosure of confidential information. This could negatively affect our relationships with customers or trading partners, lead to potential claims against the Company, and damage our image and reputation.Our pension funding requirements and expenses are affected by certain factors outside our control.Our funding obligations and pension expense for our two U.S. qualified pension plans are driven by the performance of assets set aside in trusts for these plans, the discount rate used to value the plans’ liabilities, actuarial data and experience, and legal and regulatory funding requirements. Changes in these factors could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, liquidity, or shareholders’ equity. In addition, a small portion of our pension plan assets are invested in equity securities, which can experience significant declines if economic conditions or financial markets weaken. The level of the Company's funding of our qualified pension plan liabilities was approximately 80 percent as of December 31, 2017. Although we have attempted to minimize this risk through pension de-risking actions, including moving investments to fixed income from equities and reducing liabilities through lump sum and annuity offerings, our future pension expense and funding requirements could increase due to the effect of adverse changes in the discount rate and asset levels along with a decline in the estimated return on plan assets. In addition, changes to legal regulations could require us to make increased contributions to the pension plans; these contributions could negatively affect cash flow.We are currently mitigating these risks by maintaining an asset allocation with a high percentage of fixed income investments and by lowering plan liabilities by transferring obligations to a third party through annuity purchases. The timing and amount of our share repurchases are subject to a number of uncertainties.The Board of Directors has authorized the Company’s discretionary repurchase of outstanding common stock, to be systematically completed in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions.  The remaining authorization under these programs is $110 million. The amount and timing of share repurchases are based on a variety of factors.  Important considerations that could cause us to limit, suspend, or delay stock repurchases include:13Table of Contents•unfavorable market conditions;•the trading price of the Company's common stock;•the nature of other investment opportunities available to us from time to time; and•the availability of cash.  Delaying, limiting, or suspending our stock repurchase program may negatively affect our stock price and performance versus earnings per share targets.Our profitability may suffer as a result of competitive pricing and other pressures.The introduction of lower-priced alternative products or services by other companies can hurt our competitive position in all of our businesses. We are constantly subject to competitive pressures in which predominantly international manufacturers may pursue a strategy of aggressive pricing, particularly during periods when their local currency weakens versus the U.S. dollar. Such pricing pressure may limit our ability to increase prices for our products in response to raw material and other cost increases and negatively affect our profit margins.In addition, our independent boat builder customers may react negatively to potential competition for their products from Brunswick’s own boat brands, which can lead them to purchase marine engines and marine engine supplies from competing marine engine manufacturers and may negatively affect demand for our products.Our ability to remain competitive depends on successfully introducing new products and services that meet customer expectations.We believe that our customers look for and expect quality, innovation, and advanced features when evaluating and making purchasing decisions about products and services in the marketplace. Our ability to remain competitive and meet our growth objectives may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development, such as an inability to develop viable new products or customer solutions, gain market acceptance of new products, generate sufficient capital to fund new product development, or obtain adequate intellectual property protection for new products. To meet ever-changing consumer demands, both timing of market entry and pricing of new products are critical.  As a result, we may not be able to introduce new products that are necessary to remain competitive in all markets that we serve.  Furthermore, we must continue to meet or exceed customers' expectations regarding product quality and after-sales service.We manufacture and sell products that create exposure to potential claims and litigation.Our manufacturing operations and the products we produce could result in product quality, warranty, personal injury, property damage, and other issues, thereby increasing the risk of litigation and potential liability, as well as regulatory fines. To address this risk, we have established a global, enterprise-wide program charged with the responsibility for addressing, reviewing, and reporting on product integrity issues. Historically, the resolution of such claims has not had a materially adverse effect on our business, and we maintain what we believe to be adequate insurance coverage to mitigate a portion of these risks. However, we may experience material losses in the future, incur significant costs to defend claims or issue product recalls, be subjected to fines or penalties, or experience claims in excess of our insurance coverage or that are not covered by insurance. Furthermore, our reputation may be adversely affected by such claims, whether or not successful, including potential negative publicity about our products. We record accruals for known potential liabilities, but there is the possibility that actual losses may exceed these accruals and therefore negatively impact earnings.Compliance with environmental, zoning, data protection, and other laws and regulations may increase costs and reduce demand for our products.We are subject to federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations, including product safety, environmental, health and safety, privacy, and other regulations.  While we believe that we maintain the requisite licenses and permits and that we are in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations, a failure to satisfy these and other regulatory requirements could result in fines or penalties, and compliance could increase the cost of operations. The adoption of additional laws, rules, and regulations, including stricter emissions standards, could increase our manufacturing costs, increase consumer pricing, and reduce consumer demand for our products.  Environmental restrictions, boat plant emission restrictions, and permitting and zoning requirements can limit production capacity, access to water for boating, marina, and storage space. While future licensing requirements, including any licenses imposed on recreational boating, are not expected to be unduly restrictive, they may deter potential customers, thereby reducing our sales. Furthermore, regulations allowing the sale of fuel containing higher levels of ethanol for automobiles, which is not appropriate or intended for use in marine engines, may nonetheless result in increased warranty, service costs, product 14Table of Contentsdissatisfaction, and other claims against the Company if boaters mistakenly use this fuel in marine engines, causing damage to and the degradation of components in their marine engines.Our manufacturing processes involve the use, handling, storage and contracting for recycling or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes. Accordingly, we are subject to regulations regarding these substances, and the misuse or mishandling of such substances could expose us to liabilities, including claims for property, personal injury, or natural resources damages, or fines. We are also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property, including cleanup efforts currently underway. If a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from one of our current or former properties or another location where we have disposed of hazardous materials, we may be held liable for the contamination, regardless of knowledge or whether we were at fault, and the amount of such liability could be material.We are subject to various data protection and privacy laws and regulations in the foreign countries where we operate because we collect, store, process, and use personal information, and we rely on third parties that are not directly under our control to do so as well. The European Union has finalized a General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that will become effective in May 2018 and will impose an even greater compliance burden with respect to privacy and data security. The GDPR and a growing number of legislative and regulatory bodies elsewhere in the world have adopted consumer notification requirements in the event of unauthorized access to or acquisition of certain types of personal data. These breach notification laws continue to evolve and may be inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another. Complying with these obligations could cause us to incur substantial costs and could increase negative publicity surrounding any incident that compromises personal data. Additionally, we are subject to laws governing our relationships with employees, including, but not limited to, employment obligations as a federal contractor and employee wage, hour, and benefits issues, such as pension funding and health care benefits. Compliance with these rules and regulations, and compliance with any changes to current regulations, could increase the cost of our operations.Changes in income tax laws or enforcement could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.Although domestic tax reform legislation in the form of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), signed into law on December 22, 2017, should have an overall positive impact on our financial statements, our current estimates of the impact of the legislation could change as we analyze and apply additional regulations or guidance issued by the government. In addition, other changes in international and domestic tax laws, including the reaction by states to the corporate tax changes in the TCJA, and changes in tax law enforcement, could negatively impact our tax provision, cash flow, and/or tax related balance sheet amounts, including our deferred tax asset values. Changes in U.S. tax law will likely have broader implications, including impacts to the economy, currency markets, inflation environment, consumer behavior, and/or competitive dynamics, which it is difficult to predict, and may positively or negatively impact the Company and our results.An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill, trade names, and other long-lived assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth.Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as our trade names, are recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition and are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. In evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill and trade names, we make assumptions regarding future operating performance, business trends, and market and economic conditions. Such analyses further require us to make certain assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates, and discount rates.  Uncertainties are inherent in evaluating and applying these factors to the assessment of goodwill and trade name recoverability. We could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill or trade names prior to the annual assessment if we experience business disruptions, unexpected significant declines in operating results, a divestiture of a significant component of our business, or declines in market capitalization.We also continually evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of our definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets may warrant revision or whether the remaining balance of such assets may not be recoverable. We use an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flow over the remaining life of the asset in measuring whether the asset is recoverable.If the future operating performance of the Company's reporting units is not sufficient, we could be required to record non-cash impairment charges. Impairment charges could substantially affect our reported earnings in the periods such charges are recorded. In addition, impairment charges could indicate a reduction in business value which could limit our ability to obtain adequate financing in the future.  As of December 31, 2017, goodwill was approximately 13 percent of total assets and included $391 million of goodwill related to the Fitness segment, $32 million of goodwill related to the Marine Engine segment, and $2 million of goodwill related to the Boat segment.15Table of ContentsCertain activist shareholder actions could cause us to incur expense and hinder execution of our strategy.We actively engage in discussions with our shareholders regarding further strengthening our Company and creating long-term shareholder value. This ongoing dialogue can include certain divisive activist tactics, which can take many forms. Some shareholder activism, including potential proxy contests, could result in substantial costs, such as legal fees and expenses, and divert management’s and our Board’s attention and resources from our businesses and strategic plans. Additionally, public shareholder activism could give rise to perceived uncertainties as to our future, adversely affect our relationships with dealers, distributors, or customers, make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel, and cause our stock price to fluctuate based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business. These risks could adversely affect our business and operating results.Some of our operations are conducted by joint ventures that are not operated solely for our benefit.We share ownership and management responsibilities with jointly owned companies such as BAC, Bella, and Tohatsu Marine Corporation. These joint ventures may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities, or resources as the Company because they are intended to be operated for the benefit of all co-owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. If such a conflict occurred, it could negatively impact or sales or financial results. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from international sources, which creates additional uncertainty.We intend to continue to expand our international operations and customer base as part of our growth strategy. Sales outside the United States, especially in emerging markets, are subject to various risks, including government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions, foreign currency effects, tariffs, customs duties, inflation, difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems, compliance with international laws, treaties, and regulations, and unexpected changes in regulatory environments, disruptions in distribution, and dependence on foreign personnel and unions, as well as economic and social instability. In addition, there may be tax inefficiencies in repatriating cash from non-U.S. subsidiaries, or tax laws that affect this process may change.  Instability, including, but not limited to, political events, civil unrest, and an increase in criminal activity, in locations where we maintain a significant presence could adversely impact our manufacturing and business operations. Decreased stability poses a risk of business interruption and delays in shipments of materials, components, and finished goods, as well as a risk of decreased local retail demand for our products.  In addition, global political and economic uncertainty and shifts, such as the ongoing negotiations to determine the future terms of the U.K.’s relationship with the EU (Brexit), pose risks of volatility in global markets, which could affect our operations and financial results. Changes in U.S. policy regarding foreign trade or manufacturing may create negative sentiment about the U.S. among non-U.S. customers, employees, or prospective employees, which could adversely affect our business, sales, hiring, and employee retention.  If we continue to expand our business globally, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks, which could materially impact international operations or the business as a whole.Adverse weather conditions and climate events can have a negative effect on marine revenues.Changes in seasonal weather conditions can have a significant effect on our operating and financial results, especially in the marine businesses. Sales of our marine products are typically stronger just before and during spring and summer, and favorable weather during these months generally has had a positive effect on consumer demand. Conversely, unseasonably cool weather, excessive rainfall, or drought conditions during these periods can reduce or change the timing of demand.  Additionally, climate changes, regardless of the cause, resulting in environmental changes including, but not limited to, severe weather, changing sea levels, poor water conditions, or reduced access to water, could disrupt or negatively affect our business.Catastrophic events, including natural and environmental disasters, could have a negative effect on our operations and financial results.Hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, storms, and catastrophic natural or environmental disasters could disrupt our distribution channel, operations, or supply chain and decrease consumer demand.  If a catastrophic event takes place in one of our major sales markets, our sales could be diminished.  Additionally, if such an event occurs near our business, manufacturing facilities or key suppliers' facilities, business operations and/or operating systems could be interrupted. We could be uniquely affected by a catastrophic event due to the location of certain of our boat facilities in coastal Florida and the size of the manufacturing operation in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin.16Table of Contents"

We expect 2017 will reflect continued focus on growth, including investments in new products, productivity and efficiency initiatives, acquisitions and other growth-related investments. In the longer term, our strategy remains consistent: to design, develop and introduce high-quality products featuring innovative technology and styling; to distribute products through a model that benefits our partners - dealers and distributors; to provide world-class service to our customers; to develop and maintain low-cost manufacturing processes and to continually improve productivity and efficiency; to manufacture and distribute products globally with local and regional styling; to continue implementing our capital strategy, which includes maintaining strong cash and liquidity positions, allocating capital to organic growth initiatives and strategic acquisition opportunities, funding pension obligations and continuing to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases; and to attract and retain skilled employees. These strategic objectives support our plans to grow by expanding our existing businesses. Our primary objective is to enhance shareholder value by achieving returns on investments that exceed our cost of capital. Refer to Note 6 – Segment Information and Note 2 – Discontinued Operations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our segments and discontinued operations, including net sales, operating earnings and total assets by segment. Marine Engine SegmentThe Marine Engine segment, which had net sales of $2,441.1 million in 2016, consists of the Mercury Marine Group (Mercury Marine). We believe our Marine Engine segment is a world leader in the manufacturing and sale of recreational marine engines and marine parts and accessories.  Mercury Marine manufactures and markets a full range of outboard, sterndrive and inboard engine and propulsion systems under the Mercury, Mercury MerCruiser, Mariner, Mercury Racing, Mercury Sport Jet, Mercury Jet Drive, Mercury Diesel, Sea Pro, Axius and Zeus brand names. In addition, Mercury Marine manufactures and markets marine parts and accessories under the Quicksilver, Mercury Precision Parts, Mercury Propellers, Attwood, Garelick, Whale, Land 'N' Sea, Kellogg Marine Supply, Payne's Marine Group, BLA, Seachoice and MotorGuide brand names, including marine electronics and control integration systems, steering systems, instruments, controls, propellers, trolling motors, fuel systems, service parts and lubricants. Mercury Marine also supplies integrated, high-speed diesel propulsion systems to the worldwide recreational and commercial marine markets.Mercury Marine's outboard, sterndrive and inboard engines are sold to independent boat builders, local, state and foreign governments and to Brunswick's Boat segment. In addition, Mercury Marine sells outboard engines through a global network of more than 6,000 marine dealers and distributors, specialty marine retailers and marine service centers.  White River Marine Group, LLC and its subsidiaries (including Tracker Boats) is Mercury Marine’s most significant external customer.Mercury Marine manufactures four-stroke outboard engine models ranging from 2.5 to 400 horsepower and two-stroke OptiMax outboard engines, all of which feature Mercury's direct fuel injection (DFI) technology, ranging from 150 to 300 horsepower.  All of these low-emission engines are in compliance with applicable U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requirements.  Mercury Marine's four-stroke outboard engines include Verado, a collection of supercharged outboards ranging from 175 to 400 horsepower, and Mercury Marine's naturally aspirated four-stroke outboards, ranging from 2.5 to 150 horsepower, including the 75 to 115 horsepower FourStroke, introduced in 2014, which has become known for its light weight, fuel efficiency and performance. Mercury Marine also manufactures two-stroke, non-DFI engines for certain markets outside the United States.  In addition, most of Mercury's sterndrive and inboard engines are now available with catalyst exhaust treatment and monitoring systems, and all 1Table of Contentsare compliant with applicable U.S. state and federal environmental regulations.  Mercury also makes engines that comply with global emissions and noise regulations.Mercury Marine and Mercury Racing manufacture inboard and sterndrive engine models ranging from 115 to 1,650 horsepower.  In 2016, Mercury Racing debuted the 32-valve DOHC SB4 7.0 automotive aftermarket crate engine, which adapts a high performance valve train to a customized LS based engine and produces 775 naturally aspirated horsepower, significantly improved performance and durability.To promote advanced propulsion systems with improved handling, performance and efficiency, Mercury Marine manufactures and markets advanced boat steering and engine control systems under the brand names of Mercury, Zeus and Axius.  In 2016, Mercury officially launched Active Trim, an auto-trimming device that simplifies boat operation while improving engine performance and fuel efficiency. Mercury Marine produces its gasoline sterndrive and outboard engines domestically in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, with outboard engines also produced internationally in China and Japan.  Mercury Marine manufactures 40, 50 and 60 horsepower four-stroke outboard engines in a facility in China, and produces smaller outboard engines in Japan pursuant to a joint venture with its partner, Tohatsu Corporation. Mercury Marine sources engine components from a global supply base and manufactures additional engine component parts at its Fond du Lac facility and plants in Florida and Mexico.  Mercury Marine also operates a remanufacturing business for engines and service parts in Wisconsin.  In addition, Mercury Marine has an equity ownership interest in Bella-Veneet Oy, which manufactures boats under the brand names Bella, Flipper and Aquador in Finland.  In March 2016, Mercury introduced VesselView Mobile, unveiling a digital application that instantly provides users access to their boat’s SmartCraft® digital data. VesselView Mobile, along with Mercury's Electronic Steering Helm (introduced in February 2016), each earned Innovation Awards at the 2016 International Boatbuilders Exhibition and Conference. Mercury also earned “Green Master” designation from the Wisconsin Sustainable Business Council for the sixth consecutive year, a program measuring a broad range of sustainability issues ranging from energy and water conservation to waste management, community outreach and education.On November 18, 2016, Brunswick acquired substantially all of the assets of Payne's Marine Group (Payne's), based in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada.  Payne's is a leading wholesale distributor of marine parts and accessories in Canada.  We believe this acquisition will broaden the reach of our marine parts and accessories distribution network in the Canadian market. Our parts and accessories distribution and products businesses include: Land 'N' Sea, Kellogg Marine Supply, BLA, Payne's, Attwood Marine, Garelick Mfg. Co. and Whale. These businesses are leading manufacturers and distributors of marine parts and accessories throughout North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific, offering same-day or next-day delivery service to a broad array of marine service facilities.  Intercompany sales to Brunswick's Boat segment represented approximately 12 percent of Mercury Marine's sales in 2016. Domestic demand for the Marine Engine segment's products is seasonal, with sales generally highest in the second calendar quarter of the year. Boat SegmentThe Boat segment consists of the Brunswick Boat Group (Boat Group), which manufactures and markets: fiberglass pleasure boats; yachts and sport yachts; sport cruisers and sport boats; offshore fishing boats; aluminum and fiberglass fishing boats; pontoon boats; utility boats; deck boats; inflatable boats; and heavy-gauge aluminum boats. We believe that the Boat Group, which had net sales of $1,369.9 million during 2016, is a world leader in the manufacturing and sale of pleasure motorboats. The Boat Group manages Brunswick's boat brands; evaluates and optimizes the Boat segment's boat portfolio; promotes recreational boating services and activities to enhance the consumer experience and dealer profitability; and speeds the introduction of new technologies into boat manufacturing and design processes. The Boat Group includes the following boat brands: Sea Ray L-Class yachts, yachts, sport yachts, sport cruisers and sport boats; Bayliner sport cruisers, runabouts and Heyday wake boats; Meridian yachts; Boston Whaler and Lund fiberglass fishing boats; Crestliner, Cypress Cay, Harris, Lowe, Lund and Princecraft aluminum fishing, utility, pontoon boats and deck boats; and Thunder Jet heavy-gauge aluminum boats. The Boat Group also includes a commercial and governmental sales unit that sells products to commercial customers, as well as to the United States government and state, local and foreign governments. The Boat Group procures most of its outboard engines, gasoline sterndrive engines and gasoline inboard engines from Brunswick's Marine Engine segment.  2Table of ContentsThe Boat Group also includes several Brunswick boat brands based in Europe and Asia-Pacific, such as Quicksilver, Uttern and Rayglass (including Protector and Legend), which are typically equipped with Mercury Marine engines and often include other parts and accessories supplied by Mercury Marine. The Boat Group operates manufacturing facilities in Florida, Indiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Tennessee, Washington, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand and Portugal, and owns an inactive manufacturing facility in North Carolina. The Boat Group utilizes contract manufacturing facilities in Poland. On July 1, 2016, Brunswick acquired substantially all of the assets of privately held Thunder Jet Boats, Inc. (Thunder Jet), which is based in Clarkston, Washington.  Thunder Jet is a designer and builder of heavy-gauge aluminum boats.  We believe this acquisition will add breadth and depth to the Boat Group's overall product portfolio, including in the growing heavy-gauge aluminum market.  Thunder Jet is managed within the Boat Group.  The Boat Group sells its products through a global network of approximately 3,000 dealer and distributor locations, which may carry more than one of Brunswick's boat brands. Sales to the Boat Group's largest dealer, MarineMax, Inc., which has multiple locations and carries a number of the Boat Group's product lines, represented approximately 24 percent of Boat Group sales in 2016. Domestic demand for pleasure boats is seasonal, with sales generally highest in the second calendar quarter of the year.Fitness SegmentOur Fitness segment is comprised of the Fitness division (Fitness), which designs, manufactures and markets a full line of reliable, high-quality cardiovascular fitness equipment (including treadmills, total body cross-trainers, stair climbers and stationary exercise bicycles) and strength-training equipment under the Life Fitness, Hammer Strength, Cybex, Indoor Cycling Group and SCIFIT brands.  The Fitness segment also includes InMovement products for productive well-being and our active recreation business, including billiards tables, accessories and game room furniture. We believe that our Fitness segment, which had net sales of $980.4 million during 2016, is the world's largest manufacturer of commercial fitness equipment and a leading manufacturer of high-quality consumer fitness equipment.  Fitness' commercial customers include health clubs, corporations, schools and universities, hotels, professional and collegiate sports teams, retirement and assisted living facilities and the military and governmental agencies. Planet Fitness Inc. is the segment's most significant customer. Fitness makes commercial sales through its direct sales force, domestic dealers and international distributors.  Consumer products are available at specialty retailers, select mass merchants, sporting goods stores, through international distributors and on the Life Fitness website.The billiards business was established in 1845 and is Brunswick's heritage business.  The billiards business designs and markets billiards tables, table tennis tables and Air Hockey tables, as well as game room furniture and related accessories, under the Brunswick and Contender brands.  InMovement is a business dedicated to addressing workplace inactivity and combating the harmful effects of a sedentary lifestyle by offering products designed to incorporate subtle movement into employee work habits.  On January 20, 2016, we acquired 100 percent of privately held Cybex International, Inc. (Cybex), a leading manufacturer of commercial fitness equipment, which is currently based in Medway, Massachusetts.  Cybex offers a full line of cardiovascular and strength products.  We believe the acquisition will expand the Fitness segment's participation in key markets, including commercial fitness, and add to our manufacturing footprint to meet current and future demand more effectively.  On August 31, 2016, we acquired 100 percent of Indoor Cycling Group (ICG), a market leader specializing in the design of indoor cycling equipment, based in Nuremburg, Germany.  We believe the ICG acquisition will strengthen our position in indoor cycling and provide a strong foundation to expand in the growing group exercise market.  Cybex and ICG are managed within the Fitness segment.The Fitness segment's principal manufacturing facilities are located in Illinois, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Wisconsin and Hungary, with principal third party contract manufacturing partners in China and Taiwan. Fitness distributes its products worldwide from regional warehouses and production facilities. Demand for Fitness products is seasonal, with sales generally highest in the fourth quarter of the year.Discontinued OperationsOn July 17, 2014, we entered into an agreement to sell our retail bowling business to AMF Bowling Centers, Inc. (AMF).  In connection with our decision to sell the bowling centers, we also announced our intention to divest our bowling products business.  The billiards business, which was previously reported in the Bowling & Billiards segment, remains part of the Company and is 3Table of Contentsbeing reported in the Fitness segment for all periods presented.  On September 18, 2014, we completed the sale of our retail bowling business to AMF. On May 22, 2015, we completed the sale of our bowling products business to BlueArc Capital Management L.L.C.  As a result of these actions, these businesses, which were previously recorded in the Bowling & Billiards segment, are reported as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented.  We do not have or anticipate having any significant continuing involvement or continuing cash flows associated with these businesses. Refer to Note 2 – Discontinued Operations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding discontinued operations.Financial ServicesThrough our Brunswick Financial Services Corporation subsidiary, we own a 49 percent interest in a joint venture, Brunswick Acceptance Company, LLC (BAC). Under the terms of the joint venture agreement, BAC provides secured wholesale inventory floorplan financing to our boat and engine dealers.  Prior to March 1, 2016, CDF Ventures, LLC (CDFV), a subsidiary of GE Capital Corporation (GECC), owned the remaining 51 percent. On March 1, 2016, GECC sold its Commercial Distribution Finance business, including CDFV and its interest in the BAC joint venture, to Wells Fargo & Company. The transaction did not have a material effect on BAC.Effective July 31, 2015, the joint venture was extended through December 31, 2019.  The joint venture agreement contains provisions allowing for the renewal of the agreement or purchase of the other party's interest in the joint venture at the end of its term. Alternatively, either partner may terminate the agreement at the end of its term.  In June 2016, the parties amended the joint venture agreement to adjust a financial covenant that was conformed to the maximum leverage ratio test contained in our revolving credit facility described in Note 16 – Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Additionally, we offer financial services through Brunswick Product Protection Corporation, which provides marine dealers the opportunity to offer extended product warranties to retail customers, and through Blue Water Dealer Services, Inc., which provides retail financial services to marine dealers. Each company allows us to offer a more complete line of financial services to our boat and marine engine dealers and their customers. Refer to Note 10 – Financial Services in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about our financial services. DistributionWe utilize distributors, dealers and retailers (Dealers) for the majority of our boat sales and significant portions of our sales of marine engine, fitness and billiards products. We have over 16,000 Dealers serving our business segments worldwide. Our marine Dealers typically carry one or more of the following product categories - boats, engines and related parts and accessories. We own Land 'N' Sea, Kellogg Marine Supply and Payne's Marine Group, which comprise the primary parts and accessories distribution platforms for our Marine Engine segment in North America. We believe that these businesses, collectively, are the leading distributors of marine parts and accessories throughout North America, with 20  distribution warehouses located throughout the United States and Canada offering same-day or next-day delivery service to a broad array of marine service facilities and Dealers. We also believe we are the leading parts and accessories distributor in the Asia-Pacific region. Our Dealers are independent companies or proprietors that range in size from small, family-owned businesses to a large, publicly-traded corporation with substantial revenues and multiple locations. Some Dealers sell our products exclusively, while a majority also carry competitors' and complementary products. We partner with our boat dealer network to improve quality, service, distribution and delivery of parts and accessories to enhance the boating customer's experience. Demand for a significant portion of our products is seasonal, and a number of our Dealers are relatively small and/or highly-leveraged. As a result, many dealers secure floor plan financing from BAC or other third party finance companies, enabling them to provide stable channels for our products. In addition to the financing BAC offers, we may also provide our Dealers with incentive programs, loan guarantees, inventory repurchase commitments and financing receivable arrangements, under which we are obligated to repurchase inventory or receivables from a finance company in the event of a Dealer's default. We believe that these arrangements are in our best interest; however, these arrangements expose us to credit and business risk. Our business units, along with BAC, maintain active credit operations to manage this financial exposure, and we continually seek opportunities to sustain and improve the financial health of our various distribution channel partners. Refer to Note 8 – Financing Receivables and Note 13 – Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these arrangements.4Table of ContentsInternational OperationsOur sales to customers in markets other than the United States were $1,457.0 million (32 percent of net sales), $1,377.9 million (33 percent of net sales) and $1,438.7 million (37 percent of net sales) in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We transact a portion of our sales in non-U.S. markets in local currencies, while a meaningful portion of our product costs are denominated in U.S. dollars as a result of our U.S. manufacturing operations. As a result, the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar affects the financial results of our non-U.S. operations. Non-U.S. sales are set forth in Note 6 – Segment Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and are also included in the table below, which details our non-U.S. sales by region:(in millions)2016 2015 2014Europe$569.2 $506.0 $533.5Canada284.6 282.9 302.4Asia-Pacific363.1 307.9 286.0Latin America151.2 183.2 219.0Africa & Middle East88.9 97.9 97.8Total$1,457.0 $1,377.9 $1,438.7Marine Engine segment non-U.S. sales represented approximately 47 percent of our non-U.S. sales in 2016. The segment's principal non-U.S. operations include the following:•Distribution, sales, service and applications engineering offices in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Malaysia, New Zealand and Singapore; •Sales or representative offices in Dubai, Finland, France, Italy, Japan, Norway, Russia, Sweden and Switzerland; •    A component manufacturing facility in Mexico;•An outboard engine assembly plant in Suzhou, China; •    An outboard engine assembly plant operated by a joint venture in Japan; and•   A parts and accessories manufacturing facility in Northern Ireland.Boat segment non-U.S. sales comprised approximately 23 percent of our non-U.S. sales in 2016.  The Boat Group manufactures or assembles a portion of its products in Brazil, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand and Portugal, as well as in boat plants owned and operated by third parties in Poland that perform contract manufacturing for us, and are sold worldwide through Dealers. The Boat Group has sales or import offices in Belgium, Brazil, Canada, France, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland and Sweden.Fitness segment non-U.S. sales comprised approximately 30 percent of our non-U.S. sales in 2016. Life Fitness sells its products worldwide and has sales and distribution centers in Brazil, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom. The Fitness segment manufactures strength-training equipment and select lines of cardiovascular equipment in Hungary for its international markets, and has relationships with third party contract manufacturing partners in China and Taiwan. Raw Materials and SuppliesWe purchase a wide variety of raw materials from our supplier base, including aluminum, resins, oil and steel, as well as product parts and components, such as engine blocks and boat windshields. The prices for these raw materials, parts and components fluctuate depending on market conditions. Significant increases in the cost of such materials would raise our production costs, which could reduce profitability if we did not recoup the increased costs through higher product prices. As our manufacturing operations continued to raise production levels in 2016, our need for raw materials and supplies increased.  During 2016, we experienced some shortages or delayed delivery of certain materials, parts and supplies essential to our manufacturing operations.  We have addressed and will continue to address this issue by identifying alternative suppliers, working to secure adequate inventories of critical supplies and continually monitoring the capabilities of our supplier base. In 2017, we anticipate our suppliers will need to increase their manufacturing operations to meet the rising demand for their products and, in many cases, may need to hire additional workers in order to fulfill the orders placed by us and other customers.  We also continue to expand our global procurement operations to better leverage purchasing power across our divisions and to improve supply chain and cost efficiencies. We mitigate commodity price risk on certain raw material purchases by entering into fixed priced contracts to mitigate exposure related to changes in commodity prices.5Table of Contents Intellectual PropertyWe have, and continue to obtain, patent rights covering certain features of our products and processes. By law, our patent rights, which consist of patents and patent licenses, have limited lives and expire periodically. We believe that our patent rights are important to our competitive position in all of our business segments.  Our trademark rights have indefinite lives, and many are well known to the public and are considered to be valuable assets. Most of our intellectual property is owned by U.S. entities.  In the Marine Engine segment, patent rights principally relate to features of outboard engines and inboard-outboard drives, hybrid drives and pod drives, including: die-cast powerheads; cooling and exhaust systems; drivetrain, clutch and gearshift mechanisms; boat/engine mountings; shock-absorbing tilt mechanisms; ignition systems; propellers; marine vessel control systems; fuel and oil injection systems; supercharged engines; outboard mid-section structures; segmented cowls; hydraulic trim, tilt and steering; screw compressor charge air cooling systems; a range of proprietary metal alloys; and airflow silencers. In the Boat segment, patent rights principally relate to processes for manufacturing fiberglass hulls, decks and components for boat products, as well as patent rights related to interiors and other boat features and components. In the Fitness segment, patent rights principally relate to fitness equipment designs and components, including patents covering internal processes, programming functions, displays, design features and styling, as well as billiards table designs and components and active workplace furniture and equipment. The following are our principal trademarks: Marine Engine Segment:  Attwood, Axius, Garelick, Kellogg Marine Supply, Land 'N' Sea, Mariner, MerCruiser, Mercury, Mercury Marine, Mercury Precision Parts, Mercury Propellers, Mercury Racing, MotorGuide, OptiMax, Quicksilver, Seachoice, SeaPro, SmartCraft, Sport-Jet, Swivl-Eze, Valiant, Verado, Whale and Zeus.Boat Segment:  Bayliner, Boston Whaler, Crestliner, Cypress Cay, Harris, Heyday, Lowe, Lund, Master Dealer, Meridian, Princecraft, Protector, Quicksilver, Rayglass, Sea Ray, Thunder Jet and Uttern.Fitness Segment:  Air Hockey, Brunswick, Contender, Cybex, Flex Deck, Gold Crown, Hammer Strength, Indoor Cycling Group, InMovement, Lifecycle, Life Fitness and SCIFIT.Competitive Conditions and PositionWe believe that we have a reputation for quality in each of our highly competitive lines of business. We compete in various markets by: utilizing efficient production techniques; developing and strengthening our leading brands; developing and promoting innovative technological advancements; undertaking effective marketing, advertising and sales efforts; providing high-quality, innovative products at competitive prices; and offering extensive aftermarket products. Strong competition exists in each of our product groups, but no single enterprise competes with us in all product groups. In each product area, competitors range in size from large, highly-diversified companies to small, single-product businesses. We also indirectly compete with businesses that offer alternative leisure products or activities. The following summarizes our competitive position in each segment: Marine Engine Segment:  We believe the Marine Engine segment is a world leader in the manufacture and sale of recreational and commercial marine engines and marine parts and accessories.  The marine engine market is highly competitive among several major international companies that comprise the majority of the market, including Japanese-based outboard engine manufacturers, as well as several smaller companies including Chinese manufacturers. Competitive advantage in this segment is a function of product features, technological leadership, quality, service, pricing, performance and durability, along with effective promotion and distribution. Boat Segment:  We believe that the Boat segment is a world leader in the manufacture and sale of pleasure motorboats.  There are several major manufacturers of pleasure and offshore fishing boats, along with hundreds of smaller manufacturers. Consequently, this business is both highly competitive and highly fragmented. We believe that we have the broadest range of boat product offerings in the world, with boats ranging in size from 10 to 65 feet. In all of our boat operations, we compete on the basis of product features, technology, quality, brand strength, dealer service, pricing, performance, value, durability and styling, along with effective promotion and distribution.6Table of Contents Fitness Segment:  We believe we are the world's largest manufacturer of commercial fitness equipment and a leading manufacturer of high-quality consumer fitness equipment and billiards tables. The fitness equipment industry is highly competitive among several major international companies that comprise the majority of the market, as well as many smaller manufacturers, which creates a highly fragmented, competitive landscape. Many of our fitness equipment offerings include industry-leading product features, and we place significant emphasis on introducing innovative fitness equipment to the market. Competitive focus is also placed on product quality, technology, service, pricing, state-of-the-art biomechanics and effective promotional activities.  The billiards industry continues to experience competitive pressure from low-cost billiards manufacturers outside the United States, and InMovement products also face competition, primarily from furniture manufacturers and distributors.   Research and DevelopmentWe strive to improve our competitive position in all of our segments by continuously investing in research and development to drive innovation in our products and manufacturing technologies. Our research and development investments support the introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products. Research and development expenses were 3.1 percent of net sales in 2016, 2015 and 2014. Research and development expenses by segment are discussed in Note 6 – Segment Information.

Shareholders and other interested parties may request email notification of the posting of these documents through the Investors section of our website. 7Table of Contents Item 1A.  Risk Factors
The Company's operations and financial results are subject to certain risks and uncertainties, including those described below, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our common stock.Worldwide economic conditions have hurt our industries, businesses and results of operations and may continue to do so.In times of economic uncertainty and contraction, consumers tend to have less discretionary income and to defer expenditures for discretionary items, which adversely affects our financial performance, especially in the marine businesses.   Although we have worked to expand the portions of our portfolio that are less susceptible to economic cycles, a portion of the business remains cyclical and sensitive to personal spending levels.  In addition, general economic conditions in certain international markets, including Latin America, Africa and the Middle East and Canada, continue to be challenging with respect to weak currencies, commodity market impacts and corresponding weak economic conditions.Deterioration in general economic conditions that in turn diminishes consumer confidence or discretionary income may reduce our sales, or we may decide to lower pricing for our products, thus adversely affecting our financial results, including increasing the potential for future impairment charges.   Further, most of our products are used for recreation, and consumers’ limited discretionary income in times of economic hardship may be diverted to other activities that occupy their time, such as other forms of recreation, religious, cultural or community activities.  We cannot predict the timing or strength of economic recovery, either worldwide or in the specific markets in which we compete.  Changes in currency exchange rates can adversely affect our results.Some of our sales are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. Consequently, a strong U.S. dollar may adversely affect reported revenues. We have hedging programs in place to reduce our risk to currency fluctuations; however, we cannot hedge against all currency risks, especially over the long term.  We maintain a portion of our cost structure in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which partially mitigates the impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar.  This includes manufacturing operations for boats in Europe and Canada, fitness equipment in Europe, and smaller outboard engines manufactured and purchased from our joint venture in Japan.  We also continue to evaluate the supply chain and cost structure for opportunities to further mitigate foreign currency risks.  We sell products manufactured in the U.S. into certain international markets in U.S. dollars, including to Canada, Europe and Latin America.  Demand for our products in these markets may be diminished by a strengthening U.S. dollar.  Some of our competitors with cost positions based outside the U.S., including Asian-based outboard engine and fitness equipment manufacturers, European-based large fiberglass boat manufacturers and a European-based fitness equipment manufacturer, may have an improved cost position due to a strengthening U.S. dollar, which could result in pricing pressures on our products.  These factors existed throughout 2015 and 2016, but we do not believe they resulted in any material change in our competitive position.An inability to make targeted acquisitions or failure to successfully integrate newly acquired businesses could negatively impact financial results.Our growth initiatives include making strategic acquisitions, which depend on the availability of suitable targets at acceptable terms and our ability to complete the deals.  In order to manage our acquisition strategy, we conduct rigorous due diligence, involve various functions and continually review our strategy and target acquisitions, all of which we believe mitigates our acquisition risks.  However, we cannot assure that acquisitions will be consummated or that, if consummated, they will be successful.  Acquisitions pose risks such as our ability to project and evaluate market demand, maximize potential synergies and cost savings; make accurate accounting estimates; and achieve anticipated business objectives.  As we continue to grow, in part, through acquisitions, our success depends on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these risks.  If acquired businesses do not achieve projected results, our growth may be limited and our results adversely affected.  In addition, acquisitions present integration risks, including that the acquisition may:•disrupt operations in core, adjacent or acquired businesses; •require more time than anticipated to be fully integrated into Company operations and systems; •create more costs than projected; •divert management attention; •create the potential of losing customer, supplier or other critical business relationships; and •pose difficulties retaining employees.  8Table of ContentsIf we fail to timely and successfully integrate new businesses into existing operations, we may see higher production costs, lost sales or otherwise diminished earnings and financial results.Failure to successfully implement our strategic plan and growth initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.Our ability to continue generating strong cash flow and profits depends partly on the sustained successful execution of our strategic plan and growth initiatives, including making acquisitions and expanding into new adjacent markets and customers.  To address risks associated with our plan and growth initiatives, we have established processes to regularly review, manage and modify our plans, and we believe we have appropriate oversight to monitor initiatives and their impact. Our strategic plan and growth initiatives require significant capital investment and management attention, however, which could result in the diversion of these resources from the core business and other business issues and opportunities.  Additionally, any new initiative is subject to certain risks, including customer acceptance, competition, the ability to manufacture products on schedule and to specification, the ability to create the necessary supply chain and/or the ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel.  There is no assurance that we will be able to develop and successfully implement our strategic plan and growth initiatives to a point at which they will become profitable or generate positive cash flow.Fiscal concerns may negatively impact worldwide credit conditions and adversely affect our industries, businesses and financial condition.Fiscal policy could have a material adverse impact on worldwide economic conditions, the financial markets and availability of credit and, consequently, may negatively affect our industries, businesses and overall financial condition.  Customers often finance purchases of our products, particularly boats. Credit market conditions continued to improve in 2016, but remained less favorable overall than those in existence prior to the decline in marine retail demand beginning in 2007.  While interest rates are generally lower, there continue to be fewer lenders, tighter underwriting and loan approval criteria, greater down payment requirements and negative loan equity, particularly in larger products.  If credit conditions worsen, and adversely affect the ability of customers to finance potential purchases at acceptable terms and interest rates, it could result in a decrease in sales or delay improvement in sales.Dealer or distributor inability to secure adequate access to capital could adversely affect our sales.Our dealers require adequate liquidity to finance their operations, including purchasing our products.  Dealers are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could unfavorably affect their liquidity positions, including, among other things, continued access to adequate financing sources on a timely basis on reasonable terms.  These financing sources are vital to our ability to sell products through our distribution network, particularly to boat and engine dealers.  Entities affiliated with Wells Fargo & Company, including BAC, the Company’s 49 percent owned joint venture, finance a significant portion of our boat and engine sales to dealers through floorplan financing to marine dealers. Many factors continue to influence the availability and terms of financing that our dealer floorplan financing providers offer, including: •their ability to access certain capital markets, such as the securitization and the commercial paper markets, and to fund their operations in a cost effective manner; •the performance of their overall credit portfolios; •their willingness to accept the risks associated with lending to marine dealers; and •the overall creditworthiness of those dealers.  Our sales could be adversely affected if financing terms change unfavorably or if BAC were to be terminated.  This could require dealers to find alternative sources of financing, including our direct financing to dealers, which could require additional capital to fund the associated receivables.Our financial results could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective distribution.We rely on third-party dealers and distributors to sell the majority of our products, particularly in the marine businesses.  Maintaining a reliable network of dealers is essential to our success.  We face competition from other manufacturers in attracting and retaining distributors and independent boat dealers. A significant deterioration in the number or effectiveness of our dealers and distributors could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.Although at present we believe dealer health to be generally favorable, weakening demand for marine products could hurt our dealers’ financial performance.  In particular, reduced cash flow from decreases in sales and tightening credit markets may 9Table of Contentsimpair dealers' ability to fund operations.  Inability to fund operations can force dealers to cease business, and we may be unable to obtain alternate distribution in the vacated market.  An inability to obtain alternate distribution could unfavorably affect our net sales through reduced market presence.  If economic conditions deteriorate, we anticipate that dealer failures or voluntary market exits would increase, especially if overall retail demand materially declines. Finally, labor disruption at major ports and shipping hubs around the world may adversely affect our ability to transport raw materials to our facilities and products to our distributors and end-use customers, potentially resulting in increased transportation costs and lost sales.Adverse economic, credit and capital market conditions could have a negative impact on our financial results.We do not frequently rely on short-term capital markets to meet our working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, pay dividends or fund employee benefit programs; however, we do maintain short-term borrowing facilities that can be used to meet these capital requirements.  In addition, over the long term, we may determine that it is necessary to access the capital markets to refinance existing long-term indebtedness or for other initiatives.Adverse global economic conditions, market volatility and regulatory uncertainty could lead to volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets.  This could adversely affect our ability to access capital and credit markets or increase the cost to do so, which could have a negative impact on our business, financial results and competitive position.Inventory reductions by major dealers, retailers and independent boat builders could adversely affect our financial results.The Company and our dealers, retailers and other distributors could decide to reduce the number of units they hold, particularly if demand trails forecasted levels or if new product introductions are expected to replace older products.  Such efforts tend to result in wholesale sales reductions in excess of retail sales reductions and would likely result in lower production levels of our products, causing lower rates of absorption of fixed costs in our manufacturing facilities and lower margins. While we continue to work to keep dealer inventories at appropriate levels, potential inventory reductions remain a risk to our future sales and results of operations.We may be required to repurchase inventory or accounts of certain dealers.We have agreements with certain third-party finance companies to provide financing to our customers, enabling them to purchase our products.  In connection with these agreements, we may either have obligations to repurchase our products from the finance company, or may have recourse obligations to the finance company on the dealer’s receivables.  These obligations may be triggered if our dealers default on their debt obligations to the finance companies.Our maximum contingent obligation to repurchase inventory and our maximum contingent recourse obligations on customer receivables are less than the total balances of dealer financings outstanding under these programs, because our obligations under certain of these arrangements are subject to caps, or are limited based on the age of product.  Our risk related to these arrangements is mitigated by the proceeds we receive on the resale of repurchased product to other dealers, or by recoveries on receivables purchased under the recourse obligations.Our inventory repurchase obligations relate primarily to the inventory floorplan credit facilities of our boat and engine dealers. Our actual historical repurchase experience related to these arrangements has been substantially less than our maximum contractual obligations. If dealers file for bankruptcy or cease operations, however, we could incur losses associated with the repurchase of our products.  In addition, as the repurchases may be triggered by dealer bankruptcies, our net sales and earnings may be unfavorably affected as a result of reduced market coverage and the associated decline in sales.Declines in marine industry demand could cause an increase in future repurchase activity, or could require us to incur losses in excess of established reserves.  In addition, our cash flow and loss experience could be adversely affected if repurchased inventory is not successfully distributed to other dealers in a timely manner, or if the recovery rate on the resale of the product declines.  The finance companies could require changes in repurchase or recourse terms that would result in an increase in our contractual contingent obligations.Loss of key customers could harm our business.In each segment, we have important relationships with key customers.  If we lost such a key customer, our business could be adversely effected.  In addition, certain customers could try to negotiate more favorable pricing of our products, which could depress earnings.  In an effort to mitigate the risk associated with reliance on key customer accounts, we continually monitor such relationships and maintain a complete and competitive product lineup. 10Table of ContentsOur success depends upon the continued strength of our brands.We believe that our brands, including Mercury, Life Fitness, Sea Ray, Boston Whaler and Lund, significantly contribute to our success, and that maintaining and enhancing these brands is important to expanding our customer base.  A failure to adequately promote and protect our brands could adversely affect our business and results of operations.  Further, in connection with the divestiture of the bowling businesses, we licensed certain trademarks and servicemarks, including use of the name “Brunswick,” to the acquiring companies.  Our reputation may be adversely affected by the purchasers' inappropriate use of the marks or of the name Brunswick, including potential negative publicity, loss of confidence or other damage to our image due to this licensed use.  We have a fixed cost base that can affect our profitability in a declining sales environment.The fixed cost levels of operating production facilities can put pressure on profit margins when sales and production decline.  We have maintained discipline over our fixed cost base during the economic recovery; however, our profitability is dependent, in part, on our ability to spread fixed costs over an increasing number of products sold and shipped, and if we are required to reduce our rate of production, gross margins could be negatively affected if we are unable to lower fixed costs accordingly.  Consequently, decreased demand or the need to reduce inventories can lower our ability to absorb fixed costs and materially impact our results.Successfully managing the expansion of our manufacturing footprint is critical to our operating and financial results.Over the past four years, we have made strategic capital investments in capacity expansion activities that will enable our businesses to successfully capture growth opportunities and enhance product offerings.  Recently, we initiated or completed expansion activities at our facilities in Edgewater, Florida; Ramsey and Owatonna, Minnesota; Fond du Lac, Wisconsin; and Petit-Rechain, Belgium.  We must carefully manage these capital improvement projects and expansions to ensure they meet cost targets, comply with applicable environmental, safety and other regulations and uphold high-quality workmanship.  Moving production to a different plant or expanding capacity at an existing facility involves risks, including difficulties initiating production within the cost and timeframe estimated, supplying product to customers when expected, integrating new products and attracting sufficient skilled workers to handle additional production demands.  If we fail to meet these objectives, it could adversely affect our ability to meet customer demand for products and increase the cost of production versus projections, both of which could result in a significant adverse impact on operating and financial results.  Additionally, plants experiencing demand increases may face manufacturing inefficiencies; additional expenses, including higher wages; and cost inefficiencies, which could exceed projections and negatively impact financial results.Our financial results may be adversely affected by increased costs, disruption of supply or defects in raw materials, parts and product components we buy from third-party suppliers.We rely on third-parties to supply raw materials used in the manufacturing process, including oil, aluminum, copper, steel and resins, as well as product parts and components.  The prices for these raw materials, parts and components fluctuate depending on market conditions and, in some instances, commodity prices.  Substantial increases in the prices of raw materials, parts and components would increase our operating costs, and could reduce our profitability if we could not recoup the increased costs through higher product prices.  Similarly, if a critical supplier were to close its operations, cease manufacturing or otherwise fail to deliver an essential component necessary to our manufacturing operations, that could detrimentally affect our ability to manufacture and sell our products, resulting in an interruption in business operations and/or a loss of sales. In addition, some components used in our manufacturing processes, including certain engine components, furniture, upholstery and boat windshields, are available from a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers.  Operational and financial difficulties that these or other suppliers may face in the future could adversely affect their ability to supply us with the parts and components we need, which could significantly disrupt our operations.  It may be difficult to find a replacement supplier for a limited or sole source raw material, part or component without significant delay or on commercially reasonable terms.  In addition, an uncorrected defect or supplier's variation in a raw material, part or component, either unknown to us or incompatible with our manufacturing process, could jeopardize our ability to manufacture products.  Some additional supply risks that could disrupt our operations, impair our ability to deliver products to customers and negatively affect our financial results include: •financial pressures on our suppliers due to a weakening economy or unfavorable conditions in other end markets; •a deterioration of our relationships with suppliers; or •events such as natural disasters, power outages or labor strikes.  11Table of ContentsThese risks are exacerbated in the case of single-source suppliers, and the exclusive supplier of a key component potentially could exert significant bargaining power over price, quality, warranty claims or other terms.We continue to increase production; consequently, our need for raw materials and supplies continues to increase.  Our suppliers must be prepared to ramp up operations and, in many cases, hire additional workers and/or expand capacity in order to fulfill our orders and those of other customers.  Cost increases, defects or sustained interruptions in the supply of raw materials, parts or components due to delayed start-up periods our suppliers experience as they increase production efforts create risks to our operations and financial results.  The Company experienced periodic supply shortages in 2016.  We continue to address these issues by identifying alternative suppliers for key materials and components, working to secure adequate inventories of critical supplies and continually monitoring the capabilities of our supplier base.  In the future, however, we may experience shortages, delayed delivery and/or increased prices for key materials, parts and supplies that are essential to our manufacturing operations.Our pension funding requirements and expenses are affected by certain factors outside our control.Our funding obligations and pension expense for our four U.S. qualified pension plans are driven by the performance of assets set aside in trusts for these plans, the discount rate used to value the plans’ liabilities, actuarial data and experience and legal and regulatory funding requirements.  Changes in these factors could have an adverse impact on our results of operations, liquidity or shareholders’ equity.  In addition, a small portion of our pension plan assets are invested in equity securities, which can experience significant declines if economic conditions or financial markets weaken.  The level of the Company's funding of our qualified pension plan liabilities was approximately 78 percent as of December 31, 2016. Our future pension expense and funding requirements could increase due to the effect of adverse changes in the discount rate and asset levels along with a decline in the estimated return on plan assets.  In addition, changes to legal regulations could require us to make increased contributions to the pension plans; these contributions could be material and negatively affect cash flow.We are currently mitigating these risks by maintaing an asset allocation with a high percentage of fixed income investments and by lowering plan liabilities by transferring obligations to a third party through annuity purchases. The timing and amount of our share repurchases are subject to a number of uncertainties.During the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company announced that the Board of Directors had authorized the discretionary repurchase of up to $200 million of our outstanding common stock, to be systematically completed in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions.  In February 2016, the Board increased our existing share repurchase authorization by $300 million.  The remaining authorization under these programs is $240 million. The amount and timing of share repurchases are based on a variety of factors.  Important considerations that could cause us to limit, suspend or delay stock repurchases include:•unfavorable market conditions;•the trading price of the Company's common stock;•the nature of other investment opportunities available to us from time to time; and•the availability of cash.  Delaying, limiting or suspending our stock repurchase program may negatively affect our stock price and earnings per share.Higher energy and fuel costs can affect our results.Higher energy and fuel costs increase operating expenses at our manufacturing facilities and the cost of shipping products to customers.  In addition, increases in energy costs can adversely affect the pricing and availability of petroleum-based raw materials such as resins and foam that are used in many of our marine products.  Higher fuel prices may also have an adverse effect on demand for marine retail products, as they increase the cost of boat ownership and possibly affect product use.Our profitability may suffer as a result of competitive pricing and other pressures.The introduction of lower-priced alternative products or services by other companies can hurt our competitive position in all of our businesses.  We are constantly subject to competitive pressures in which predominantly international manufacturers may pursue a strategy of aggressive pricing, particularly during periods when their local currency weakens versus the U.S. dollar.  Such pricing pressure may limit our ability to increase prices for our products in response to raw material and other cost increases and negatively affect our profit margins.In addition, international boat builders continue to expand distribution in U.S. markets, mainly in the large fiberglass boat segment, thereby introducing additional product options into a market in which we believe we are a market leader.  The market 12Table of Contentsfor large boats grew slightly in 2016, and could expand, but as new entrants introduce potentially lower cost product alternatives, demand could be diverted away from our premium products. Finally, our independent boat builder customers may react negatively to potential competition for their products from Brunswick’s own boat brands, which can lead them to purchase marine engines and marine engine supplies from competing marine engine manufacturers and may negatively affect demand for our products.Our ability to remain competitive depends on successfully introducing new products and meeting customer expectations.We believe that our customers look for and expect quality, innovation and advanced features when evaluating products and making purchasing decisions.  Our ability to remain competitive and meet our growth objectives may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development, such as an inability to develop viable new products, gain market acceptance of new products, generate sufficient capital to fund new product development or obtain adequate intellectual property protection for new products. To meet ever-changing consumer demands, both timing of market entry and pricing of new products are critical.  As a result, we may not be able to introduce new products that are necessary to remain competitive in all markets that we serve.  Furthermore, we must continue to meet or exceed customers' expectations regarding product quality and after-sales service.Our business operations could be negatively impacted by an outage or breach of our information technology systems.We manage our global business operations through a variety of information technology (IT) systems which we continually enhance to increase efficiency and security.  We depend on these systems for commercial transactions, customer interactions, manufacturing, branding, employee tracking and other applications.  Some of the systems are based on legacy technology and operate with a minimal level of available support, and recent acquisitions using other systems have added to the complexity of our IT infrastructure.  We are working to upgrade, streamline and integrate these systems and have invested in strategies to prevent a failure or breach but, like those of other companies, our systems are susceptible to outages due to natural disasters, power loss, computer viruses, security breaches and similar events.  If a legacy system or another of the Company's key IT systems were to fail or if our IT systems were unable to communicate effectively, this could result in missed or delayed sales or lost opportunities for cost reduction or efficient cash management.  We exchange information with hundreds of trading partners across all aspects of our commercial operations.  A breakdown, outage, malicious intrusion, random attack or other disruption of communications could result in erroneous transactions or loss of reputation and confidence.  We have numerous e-commerce and e-marketing portals and our systems may contain personal information in connection with human resources, financial services or other business operations; therefore, we must continue to be diligent in protecting against malicious cyber attacks.  A successful breach could result in a disruption of services, fraudulent transactions or disclosure of confidential information.  This could negatively affect our relationships with customers or trading partners, lead to potential claims against the Company and damage our image and reputation.We manufacture and sell products that create exposure to potential claims and litigation.Our manufacturing footprint expansions and the products we produce could result in product quality, warranty, personal injury, property damage and other issues, thereby increasing the risk of litigation and potential liability. To address this risk, we have established a global, enterprise-wide program charged with the responsibility for addressing, reviewing and reporting on product integrity issues.  Historically, the resolution of such claims has not had a materially adverse effect on our business, and we maintain what we believe to be adequate insurance coverage to mitigate a portion of these risks.  However, we may experience material losses in the future, incur significant costs to defend claims or issue product recalls, or experience claims in excess of our insurance coverage or that are not covered by insurance.  Furthermore, our reputation may be adversely affected by such claims, whether or not successful, including potential negative publicity about our products.  We record reserves for known potential liabilities, but there is the possibility that actual losses may exceed these reserves and therefore negatively impact earnings.If our intellectual property protection is inadequate, others may be able to use our technologies and impair our ability to compete, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.We regard much of the technology underlying our products as proprietary.  We rely on a combination of patents, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws; employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements; and other contracts to establish and protect our technology and other intellectual property rights. However, we remain subject to risks, including:•the steps we take to protect our proprietary technology may be inadequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology;•third parties may independently develop similar technology;•agreements containing protections may be breached or terminated;•we may not have adequate remedies for breaches; 13Table of Contents•existing patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws may afford limited protection;•a third party could copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization;•we may be required to litigate to defend against infringement claims or to protect our intellectual property rights; and•we may not prevail in intellectual property litigation.Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult, particularly outside the U.S., and litigating intellectual property claims may result in substantial cost and divert management’s attention.  Further, we may not prevail in litigation, forcing us to seek licenses or royalty arrangements from third parties, which we may not be able to obtain on reasonable terms, or an order or requirement to stop manufacturing, using, selling or distributing products that included challenged intellectual property, which could harm our business.Compliance with environmental, zoning and other laws and regulations may increase costs and reduce demand for our products.We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including product safety, environmental, health and safety and other regulations.  While we believe that we maintain the requisite licenses and permits and that we are in material compliance with applicable laws and regulations, a failure to satisfy these and other regulatory requirements could result in fines or penalties, and compliance could increase the cost of operations.  The adoption of additional laws, rules and regulations, including higher emissions standards, could increase our manufacturing costs, increase consumer pricing and reduce consumer demand for our products.  In addition, we are unable to predict with any reasonable degree of certainty whether reforms or repeal of current laws, rules or regulations under a new administration will positively or negatively affect our operations or financial results.   Environmental restrictions, boat plant emission restrictions and permitting and zoning requirements can limit production capacity, access to water for boating, marina and storage space.  While future licensing requirements, including any licenses imposed on recreational boating, are not expected to be unduly restrictive, they may deter potential customers, thereby reducing our sales.  Furthermore, regulations allowing the sale of fuel containing higher levels of ethanol for automobiles, which is not appropriate or intended for use in marine engines, may nonetheless result in increased warranty, service costs, product dissatisfaction and other claims against the Company if boaters mistakenly use this fuel in marine engines, causing damage to and the degradation of components in their marine engines.Our manufacturing processes involve the use, handling, storage and contracting for recycling or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes.  Accordingly, we are subject to regulations regarding these substances, and the misuse or mishandling of such substances could expose us to liabilities, including claims for property, personal injury or natural resources damages, or fines.  We are also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property, including cleanup efforts currently underway.  If a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from one of our current or former properties or another location where we have disposed of hazardous materials, we may be held liable for the contamination, regardless of knowledge or whether we were at fault, and the amount of such liability could be material.Additionally, we are subject to laws governing our relationships with employees, including, but not limited to, employment obligations as a federal contractor and employee wage, hour and benefit issues, such as pension funding and health care benefits.  Changes to legislation or regulations governing employment obligations could increase the cost of our operations.Changes in income tax laws or enforcement could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.Changes in domestic and international tax laws could positively or negatively impact our tax provision, cash flow and/or tax related balance sheet amounts, including our deferred tax asset values. As a result of the administration change in the United States, the likelihood that changes may occur has increased. We are currently unable to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty what the legal changes will be and the potential outcome on our financial statements. Any changes in law will likely have broader implications, including impacts to the economy, currency markets, inflation environment, consumer behavior and/or competitive dynamics, which may positively or negatively impact the Company.An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill, trade names and other long-lived assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth.Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as our trade names, are recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition and are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise.  In evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill and trade names, we make assumptions regarding future operating performance, business trends and market and economic conditions.  Such analyses further require us to make certain assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates.  Uncertainties are inherent in evaluating and applying these factors to the assessment of goodwill and trade name recoverability.  We could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill or trade 14Table of Contentsnames prior to the annual assessment if we experience business disruptions, unexpected significant declines in operating results, a divestiture of a significant component of our business or declines in market capitalization.We also continually evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of our definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets may warrant revision or whether the remaining balance of such assets may not be recoverable.  We use an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flow over the remaining life of the asset in measuring whether the asset is recoverable.If the future operating performance of the Company's reporting units is not sufficient, we could be required to record non-cash impairment charges.  Impairment charges could substantially affect our reported earnings in the periods such charges are recorded.  In addition, impairment charges could indicate a reduction in business value which could limit our ability to obtain adequate financing in the future.  As of December 31, 2016, goodwill was approximately 13 percent of total assets and included $387 million of goodwill related to the Life Fitness segment, $25 million of goodwill related to the Marine Engine segment and $2 million of goodwill related to the Boat segment.Some of our operations are conducted by joint ventures that are not operated solely for our benefit.We share ownership and management responsibilities with jointly owned companies such as BAC, Bella and Tohatsu Marine Corporation. These joint ventures may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities or resources as the Company because they are intended to be operated for the benefit of all co-owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. If such a conflict occurred, it could negatively impact or sales or financial results. A significant portion of our revenue is derived from international sources, which creates additional uncertainty.We intend to continue to expand our international operations and customer base as part of our growth strategy.  Sales outside the United States, especially in emerging markets, are subject to various risks, including government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions, foreign currency effects, tariffs, customs duties, inflation, difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems, compliance with international laws, treaties and regulations and unexpected changes in regulatory environments, disruptions in distribution, dependence on foreign personnel and unions, as well as economic and social instability.  In addition, there may be tax inefficiencies in repatriating cash from non-U.S. subsidiaries, or tax laws that affect this process may change.  Instability, including, but not limited to, political events, civil unrest and an increase in criminal activity, in locations where we maintain a significant presence could adversely impact our manufacturing and business operations.  Decreased stability poses a risk of business interruption and delays in shipments of materials, components and finished goods, as well as a risk of decreased local retail demand for our products.  In addition, global political and economic uncertainty and shifts, such as the U.K.’s referendum on membership in the European Union, pose risks of volatility in global markets, which could affect our operations and financial results.  Changes in U.S. policy regarding foreign trade or manufacturing may create negative sentiment about the U.S. among non-U.S. customers, employees or prospective employees, which could adversely affect our business, sales, hiring and employee retention.  If we continue to expand our business globally, our success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks, which could materially impact international operations or the business as a whole.Our operations are dependent on our ability to attract and retain key contributors and on the successful implementation of our succession plans.Much of our future success depends on, among other factors, our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, including executives and skilled labor.  If we are not successful in these efforts, we may be unable to meet our operating goals and plans, which may impact our financial results.  In order to manage this risk, we perform an annual review of management succession plans with the Board of Directors, including reviewing executive officer and other important positions.  We believe this helps to substantially mitigate the risk associated with key contributor transitions.  In addition, we continuously develop and improve recruiting and training programs to attract and retain an experienced and skilled workforce.Adverse weather conditions and climate events can have a negative effect on marine revenues.Changes in seasonal weather conditions can have a significant effect on our operating and financial results, especially in the marine businesses.  Sales of our marine products are typically stronger just before and during spring and summer, and favorable weather during these months generally has had a positive effect on consumer demand.  Conversely, unseasonably cool weather, excessive rainfall or drought conditions during these periods can reduce demand.   Additionally, climate changes, regardless of 15Table of Contentsthe cause, resulting in environmental changes including, but not limited to, severe weather, changing sea levels, poor water conditions or reduced access to water, could disrupt or negatively affect our business.Catastrophic events, including natural and environmental disasters, could have a negative effect on our operations and financial results.Hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, storms and catastrophic natural or environmental disasters could disrupt our distribution channel, operations or supply chain and decrease consumer demand.  If a catastrophic event takes place in one of our major sales markets, our sales could be diminished.  Additionally, if such an event occurs near our business, manufacturing facilities or key suppliers' facilities, business operations and/or operating systems could be interrupted.  We could be uniquely affected by a catastrophic event due to the location of certain of our boat facilities in coastal Florida and the size of the manufacturing operation in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin"

In addition, Mercury Marine has an equity ownership interest in Bella-Veneet Oy, which manufactures boats under the brand names Bella, Flipper and Aquador in Finland.  On April 27, 2015, the Company acquired 100 percent of privately held BLA, which is based in Brisbane, Australia.  BLA  is Australia's largest provider of  marine parts and accessories and has an extensive dealer network throughout Australia and New Zealand.  The Company believes this acquisition will allow the Company to enhance its distribution by expanding reach and customer responsiveness in the Australian marine marketplace.  On November 6, 2015, the Company acquired 100 percent of privately held Garelick Mfg. Co., which is based in St. Paul Park, Minnesota, and is a leading manufacturer of premium seat, table hardware and marine products under its respected namesake brand, as well as the well-known “EEz-In”® mark. The Company believes this acquisition will allow it an opportunity to expand the global presence of the marine service, parts and accessories businesses and add depth and breadth to its product portfolio.  Garelick and BLA are managed within the Marine Engine segment.     Mercury Marine's parts and accessories distribution and products businesses include: Land 'N' Sea, Kellogg Marine Supply, Diversified Marine Products, Bell Recreational Products, BLA, Attwood Marine, Garelick Mfg. Co. and Whale. These businesses are leading manufacturers and distributors of marine parts and accessories throughout North America, Europe and Asia-Pacific, offering same-day or next-day delivery service to a broad array of marine service facilities.  Intercompany sales to the Company's Boat segment represented approximately 12 percent of Mercury Marine's sales in 2015.  Domestic demand for the Marine Engine segment's products is seasonal, with sales generally highest in the second calendar quarter of the year. Boat SegmentThe Boat segment consists of the Brunswick Boat Group (Boat Group), which manufactures and markets the following products: fiberglass pleasure boats; luxury yachts, yachts and sport yachts; offshore fishing boats; aluminum and fiberglass fishing boats; pontoon boats; deck boats and inflatable boats.  The Company believes that its Boat Group, which had net sales of $1,274.6 million during 2015, is a world leader in the manufacturing and sale of pleasure motorboats. The Boat Group manages Brunswick's boat brands; evaluates and optimizes the Boat segment's boat portfolio; promotes recreational boating services and activities to enhance the consumer experience and dealer profitability; and speeds the introduction of new technologies into the boat manufacturing and design processes. The Boat Group includes the following boat brands: Sea Ray L-Class yachts, yachts, sport yachts, sport cruisers and runabouts; Bayliner sport cruisers and runabouts; Meridian yachts; Boston Whaler and Lund fiberglass fishing boats; and Crestliner, Cypress Cay, Harris, Lowe, Lund and Princecraft aluminum fishing, utility, pontoon boats and deck boats. The Boat Group also includes a commercial and governmental sales unit that sells products to commercial customers, as well as to the United States government and state, local and foreign governments. The Boat Group procures most of its outboard engines, gasoline sterndrive engines and gasoline inboard engines from Brunswick's Marine Engine segment.The Boat Group also includes several Brunswick boat brands based in Europe and Asia-Pacific, which include Quicksilver, Uttern and Rayglass (Protector and Legend), which are typically equipped with Mercury Marine engines and often include other 2parts and accessories supplied by Mercury Marine. The Boat Group operates manufacturing facilities in Florida, Indiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Tennessee, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand and Portugal, and owns an inactive manufacturing facility in North Carolina.  The Boat Group utilizes contract manufacturing facilities in Poland.  The Boat Group sells its products through a global network of approximately 3,000 dealers and distributors, which may carry more than one of Brunswick's boat brands. Sales to the Boat Group's largest dealer, MarineMax Inc., which has multiple locations and carries a number of the Boat Group's product lines, represented approximately 21 percent of Boat Group sales in 2015. Domestic demand for pleasure boats is seasonal, with sales generally highest in the second calendar quarter of the year.Fitness SegmentBrunswick's Fitness segment is comprised of its Life Fitness division (Life Fitness), which designs, manufactures and markets a full line of reliable, high-quality cardiovascular fitness equipment (including treadmills, total body cross-trainers, stair climbers and stationary exercise bicycles) and strength-training equipment under the Life Fitness, Hammer Strength, SCIFIT and Cybex brands.

(SCIFIT), which is based in Tulsa, Oklahoma.  SCIFIT is a provider of fitness equipment designed for active aging seniors, medical wellness and rehabilitation markets.  The Company believes this acquisition will expand the Fitness segment's product portfolio and enable entry into these growing adjacent markets.  On August 4, 2015, Life Fitness announced the launch of InMovement, a business dedicated to addressing workplace inactivity and combating the harmful effects of a sedentary lifestyle.  The Company believes InMovement will further diversify Brunswick's portfolio of lifestyle and recreational products, taking the Company into corporate wellness, an emerging and growing market category, by offering products and services designed to incorporate subtle movement into employee work habits.  SCIFIT and InMovement are managed within the Fitness segment.On January 20, 2016, the Company acquired 100 percent of privately held Cybex International, Inc.

Life Fitness distributes its products worldwide from regional warehouses and production facilities. Demand for Life Fitness products is seasonal, with sales generally highest in the fourth quarter of the year.Discontinued OperationsThe Company recently divested its retail bowling and bowling products businesses.  On July 17, 2014, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its retail bowling business to AMF Bowling Centers, Inc. In connection with its decision to sell its bowling centers, the Company announced its intention to divest its bowling products business.   As a result of these actions, these businesses, which were previously recorded in the Bowling & Billiards segment, are reported as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented.  The Company does not have or anticipate having any significant continuing involvement or continuing cash flows associated with these businesses. The assets and liabilities of these businesses met the accounting criteria to be classified as held for sale and have been aggregated and reported on separate lines of the Consolidated Balance Sheets.3On September 18, 2014, the Company completed the sale of its retail bowling business to AMF Bowling Centers, Inc. and, in separate transactions, completed the sale of two retail bowling centers in California.  On May 22, 2015, the Company completed the sale of its bowling products business to BlueArc Capital Management LLC.  Refer to Note 2 – Discontinued Operations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company's discontinued operations.Financial ServicesThe Company, through its Brunswick Financial Services Corporation subsidiary, owns a 49 percent interest in a joint venture, Brunswick Acceptance Company, LLC (BAC).  Under the terms of the joint venture agreement, BAC provides secured wholesale inventory floorplan financing to the Company's boat and engine dealers.  CDF Ventures, LLC (CDFV), a subsidiary of GE Capital Corporation (GECC), owns the remaining 51 percent.  Effective July 31, 2015, the joint venture was extended through December 31, 2019.  On October 13, 2015, GECC reached an agreement to sell CDFV to Wells Fargo & Company, including CDFV’s interest in the BAC joint venture.  The Company does not anticipate that the sale, expected to be consummated in 2016, will have a material effect on the BAC agreement.   The joint venture agreement contains provisions allowing for the renewal of the agreement or purchase of the other party's interest in the joint venture at the end of its term. Alternatively, either partner may terminate the agreement at the end of its term.  In June 2014, the joint venture agreement was amended to adjust a financial covenant that was conformed to the leverage ratio test contained in the Facility as described in Note 16 – Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Additionally, Brunswick offers financial services through Brunswick Product Protection Corporation, which provides marine dealers the opportunity to offer extended product warranties to retail customers, and through Blue Water Dealer Services, Inc., which provides retail financial services to marine dealers. Each company allows Brunswick to offer a more complete line of financial services to its boat and marine engine dealers and their customers. Refer to Note 10 – Financial Services in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about the Company's financial services. DistributionBrunswick utilizes distributors, dealers and retailers (Dealers) for the majority of its boat sales and significant portions of its sales of marine engine, fitness and billiards products. Brunswick has over 16,000 Dealers serving its business segments worldwide. Brunswick's marine Dealers typically carry one or more of the following product categories - boats, engines and related parts and accessories. Brunswick owns Land 'N' Sea, Kellogg Marine Supply, Diversified Marine Products, Bell Recreational Products and BLA, which comprise the primary parts and accessories distribution platforms for the Company's Marine Engine segment. The Company believes that these businesses, collectively, are the leading distributors of marine parts and accessories throughout North America, with 16 distribution warehouses located throughout the United States and Canada offering same-day or next-day delivery service to a broad array of marine service facilities and Dealers.  Brunswick's Dealers are independent companies or proprietors that range in size from small, family-owned businesses to a large, publicly-traded corporation with substantial revenues and multiple locations. Some Dealers sell Brunswick's products exclusively, while a majority also carry competitors' products. Brunswick partners with its boat dealer network to improve quality, service, distribution and delivery of parts and accessories to enhance the boating customer's experience. Demand for a significant portion of Brunswick's products is seasonal, and a number of Brunswick's Dealers are relatively small and/or highly-leveraged. As a result, many Dealers secure floor plan financing from BAC or other third party finance companies, enabling them to provide stable channels for Brunswick's products. In addition to the financing BAC offers, the Company may also provide its Dealers with incentive programs, loan guarantees, inventory repurchase commitments and financing receivable arrangements, under which the Company is obligated to repurchase inventory or receivables from a finance company in the event of a Dealer's default. The Company believes that these arrangements are in its best interest; however, these arrangements expose the Company to credit and business risk. Brunswick's business units, along with BAC, maintain active credit operations to manage this financial exposure, and the Company continually seeks opportunities to sustain and improve the financial health of its various distribution channel partners. Refer to Note 8 – Financing Receivables and Note 13 – Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these arrangements.4International OperationsBrunswick's sales to customers in markets other than the United States were $1,377.9 million (33 percent of net sales), $1,438.7 million (37 percent of net sales) and $1,385.1 million (38 percent of net sales) in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The Company transacts a portion of its sales in non-U.S. markets in local currencies, and the cost of its products is generally denominated in U.S. dollars. As a result, the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar affects the financial results of Brunswick's non-U.S. operations. Non-U.S. sales are set forth in Note 6 – Segment Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and are also included in the table below, which details Brunswick's non-U.S. sales by region:(in millions)2015 2014 2013Europe$506.0 $533.5 $469.0Canada282.9 302.4 312.6Asia-Pacific307.9 286.0 281.4Latin America183.2 219.0 234.6Africa & Middle East97.9 97.8 87.5Total$1,377.9 $1,438.7 $1,385.1Marine Engine segment non-U.S. sales represented approximately 48 percent of Brunswick's non-U.S. sales in 2015. The segment's principal non-U.S. operations include the following:•Distribution, sales, service and applications engineering offices in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Malaysia, New Zealand and Singapore; •Sales or representative offices in China, Dubai, Finland, France, Italy, Japan, Norway, Russia, Sweden and Switzerland; •    A component manufacturing facility in Mexico;•An outboard engine assembly plant in Suzhou, China; •    An outboard engine assembly plant operated by a joint venture in Japan; and•   A parts and accessories manufacturing facility in Northern Ireland.Boat segment non-U.S. sales comprised approximately 25 percent of Brunswick's non-U.S. sales in 2015.  The Boat Group manufactures or assembles a portion of its products in Brazil, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand and Portugal, as well as in boat plants owned and operated by third parties in Poland that perform contract manufacturing for the Company, and are sold worldwide through Dealers. The Boat Group has sales or import offices in Belgium, Brazil, Canada, France, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland and Sweden.Fitness segment non-U.S. sales comprised approximately 27 percent of Brunswick's non-U.S. sales in 2015. Life Fitness sells its products worldwide and has sales and distribution centers in Brazil, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom. The Fitness segment manufactures strength-training equipment and select lines of cardiovascular equipment in Hungary for its international markets, and has relationships with contract manufacturers in China and Taiwan. Raw Materials and SuppliesBrunswick purchases a wide variety of raw materials from its supplier base, including aluminum, resins, oil and steel, as well as product parts and components, such as engine blocks and boat windshields. The prices for these raw materials, parts and components fluctuate depending on market conditions. Significant increases in the cost of such materials would raise the Company's production costs, which could reduce the Company's profitability if the Company did not recoup the increased costs through higher product prices. As Brunswick's manufacturing operations raised production levels in 2015, the Company's need for raw materials and supplies increased.  Continuing into 2016, Brunswick's suppliers will need to increase their manufacturing operations to meet the rising demand for their products and, in many cases, may need to hire additional workers in order to fulfill the orders placed by Brunswick and other customers. During 2015, the Company experienced some shortages or delayed delivery of certain materials, parts and supplies essential to its manufacturing operations. The Company has addressed and will continue to address this issue by identifying alternative suppliers, working to secure adequate inventories of critical supplies and continually monitoring the capabilities of its supplier base. 5The Company also continues to expand its global procurement operations to better leverage its purchasing power across its divisions and to improve supply chain and cost efficiencies. The Company mitigates its commodity price risk on certain raw material purchases by using derivatives to hedge exposure related to changes in commodity prices. Intellectual PropertyBrunswick has, and continues to obtain, patent rights covering certain features of its products and processes. By law, Brunswick's patent rights, which consist of patents and patent licenses, have limited lives and expire periodically. The Company believes that its patent rights are important to its competitive position in all of its business segments. In the Marine Engine segment, patent rights principally relate to features of outboard engines and inboard-outboard drives, hybrid drives and pod drives, including: die-cast powerheads; cooling and exhaust systems; drivetrain, clutch and gearshift mechanisms; boat/engine mountings; shock-absorbing tilt mechanisms; ignition systems; propellers; marine vessel control systems; fuel and oil injection systems; supercharged engines; outboard mid-section structures; segmented cowls; hydraulic trim, tilt and steering; screw compressor charge air cooling systems; a range of proprietary metal alloys; and airflow silencers. In the Boat segment, patent rights principally relate to processes for manufacturing fiberglass hulls, decks and components for boat products, as well as patent rights related to interiors and other boat features and components. In the Fitness segment, patent rights principally relate to fitness equipment designs and components, including patents covering internal processes, programming functions, displays, design features and styling, as well as billiards table designs and components and active workplace furniture and equipment. The following are Brunswick's principal trademarks: Marine Engine Segment:  Attwood, Axius, Bell Recreational Products, Diversified Marine Products, Garelick, Kellogg Marine Supply, Land 'N' Sea, Mariner, MerCruiser, Mercury, Mercury Marine, Mercury Parts Express, Mercury Precision Parts, Mercury Propellers, Mercury Racing, MotorGuide, OptiMax, Quicksilver, Seachoice, SeaPro, SmartCraft, Sport-Jet, Swivl-Eze, Valiant, Verado, Whale and Zeus.Boat Segment:  Bayliner, Boston Whaler, Crestliner, Cypress Cay, Harris, Lowe, Lund, Master Dealer, Meridian, Princecraft, Protector, Quicksilver, Rayglass, Sea Ray and Uttern.Fitness Segment:  Air Hockey, Brunswick, Contender, Cybex, Flex Deck, Gold Crown, Hammer Strength, InMovement, Lifecycle, Life Fitness and SCIFIT.Brunswick's trademark rights have indefinite lives, and many are well known to the public and are considered to be valuable assets.Competitive Conditions and PositionThe Company believes that it has a reputation for quality in each of its highly competitive lines of business. Brunswick competes in its various markets by: utilizing efficient production techniques; developing and strengthening its leading brands; developing and promoting innovative technological advancements; undertaking effective marketing, advertising and sales efforts; providing high-quality, innovative products at competitive prices; and offering extensive aftermarket services. Strong competition exists in each of Brunswick's product groups, but no single enterprise competes with Brunswick in all product groups. In each product area, competitors range in size from large, highly-diversified companies to small, single-product businesses. Brunswick also indirectly competes with businesses that offer alternative leisure products or activities. The following summarizes Brunswick's competitive position in each segment: Marine Engine Segment:  The Company believes its Marine Engine segment is a world leader in the manufacture and sale of recreational marine engines and marine parts and accessories.  The marine engine market is highly competitive among several major international companies that comprise the majority of the market, including Japanese-based outboard engine manufacturers, as well as several smaller companies including Chinese manufacturers. Competitive advantage in this segment is a function of product features, technological leadership, quality, service, pricing, performance and durability, along with effective promotion and distribution. 6Boat Segment:  The Company believes that its Boat segment is a world leader in the manufacture and sale of pleasure motorboats.  There are several major manufacturers of pleasure and offshore fishing boats, along with hundreds of smaller manufacturers. Consequently, this business is both highly competitive and highly fragmented. The Company believes it has the broadest range of boat product offerings in the world, with boats ranging in size from 10 to 65 feet. In all of its boat operations, Brunswick competes on the basis of product features, technology, quality, brand strength, dealer service, pricing, performance, value, durability and styling, along with effective promotion and distribution. Fitness Segment:  The Company believes it is the world's largest manufacturer of commercial fitness equipment and a leading manufacturer of high-quality consumer fitness equipment and billiards tables. The fitness equipment industry is highly competitive among several major international companies that comprise the majority of the market.  Many of the Company's fitness equipment offerings feature industry-leading product innovations, and the Company places significant emphasis on introducing new fitness equipment to the market. Competitive focus is also placed on product quality, technology, service, pricing, state-of-the-art biomechanics and effective promotional activities.  The billiards industry continues to experience competitive pressure from low-cost billiards manufacturers outside the United States, and the products and services InMovement offers also face competition, primarily from furniture manufacturers and distributors.   Research and DevelopmentThe Company strives to improve its competitive position in all of its segments by continuously investing in research and development to drive innovation in its products and manufacturing technologies. Brunswick's research and development investments support the introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products. Research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were 3.1 percent, 3.1 percent and 3.2 percent in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.  Research and development expenses by segment are shown below:            (in millions)2015 2014 2013Marine Engine$78.9 $72.5 $70.6Boat22.3 23.8 22.4Fitness24.7 23.3 21.8Total$125.9 $119.6 $114.8Number of EmployeesThe number of employees worldwide is shown below by segment:     December 31, 2015 December 31, 2014 Total Union (domestic) Total Union (domestic)Marine Engine5,548 1,803 5,320 1,723Boat4,539 — 4,024 —Fitness2,209 143 2,026 134Bowling— — 479 24Corporate311 — 316 —Total (A)12,607 1,946 12,165 1,881(A)All employee numbers exclude temporary employees.The Company believes that the relationships between its employees, any labor unions and the Company remain stable. 7Environmental RequirementsRefer to Note 13 – Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of certain environmental proceedings.Available InformationBrunswick maintains an Internet website at http://www.brunswick.com that includes links to Brunswick's Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports, and proxy statements (SEC Filngs). The SEC Filings are available without charge as soon as reasonably practicable following the time that they are filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. Shareholders and other interested parties may request email notification of the posting of these documents through the Investors section of Brunswick's website. 8 Item 1A.  Risk Factors
The Company's operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, which could adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of the Company's common stock.Worldwide economic conditions have adversely affected the Company's industries, businesses and results of operations and may continue to do so.In times of economic uncertainty and contraction, consumers tend to have less discretionary income and to defer expenditures for discretionary items, which adversely affects the Company's financial performance, especially in its marine businesses.  Although the Company has worked to expand the portions of its portfolio that are less susceptible to economic cycles, there is still a portion of the business that remains cyclical and highly sensitive to personal discretionary spending levels.  In addition, general economic conditions in certain international markets, including Canada, Brazil and Russia, continue to be challenging with respect to weak currencies, commodity market impacts and corresponding weak economic conditions.Any deterioration in general economic conditions that diminishes consumer confidence or discretionary income may reduce the Company's sales or the Company may decide to sell its products at a discount, thus adversely affecting its financial results, including increasing the potential for future impairment charges.  The Company cannot predict the timing or strength of economic recovery, either worldwide or in the specific markets in which it competes.Changes in currency exchange rates can adversely affect the Company's results.A portion of the Company's sales are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar. Consequently, a strong U.S. dollar may adversely affect reported revenues.  The Company also maintains a portion of its cost structure in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which partially mitigates the impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar.  This includes manufacturing operations for boats in Europe, Brazil and Canada, fitness equipment in Europe, as well as smaller outboard engines purchased from the Company's  joint venture in Japan.  A portion of SG&A costs are also transacted in a currency other than the U.S. dollar.  The Company maintains hedging programs to reduce its risk to currency fluctuations; however, it is not possible to hedge against all currency risk, especially over the long term.  The Company also continues to evaluate its supply chain and cost structure for opportunities to further mitigate risks associated with foreign currency.  The Company sells U.S. manufactured products into certain international markets in U.S. dollars, including the sale of products into Canada, Europe and Latin America.  Demand for the Company's products in these markets may be adversely affected by a strengthening U.S. dollar.  The Company has certain competitors with cost positions based outside the U.S., including Asian-based outboard engine and fitness equipment manufacturers, European-based large fiberglass boat manufacturers and a European-based fitness equipment manufacturer.  A strengthening U.S. dollar may provide a cost advantage to these competitors, which could result in pricing pressures.  These factors existed throughout a portion of 2014 and in 2015 and the Company does not believe they resulted in any material change in its competitive position.The inability to make targeted acquisitions or failure to successfully integrate newly acquired businesses could have an adverse effect on the Company's financial results.The Company's growth initiatives include making targeted acquisitions, which may depend on the availability of suitable acquisition targets at acceptable terms and the Company's ability to complete such acquisitions.  There can be no assurance that acquisitions will be consummated or that, if consummated, they will be successful.  Acquisitions pose risks with respect to the Company's ability to project and evaluate market demand, potential synergies and cost savings, make correct accounting estimates and achieve anticipated business goals and objectives.  As the Company continues to grow, in part, through acquisitions, its success depends on its ability to anticipate and effectively manage these risks.  If acquired businesses do not achieve forecasted results or otherwise fail to meet projections, it could affect the Company's results of operations.  Nor can the Company assure that newly acquired businesses will be timely and successfully integrated into the Company's operations.  Acquisitions present a number of integration risks, including that the acquisition may: disrupt operations in core, adjacent or acquired businesses; require more time than anticipated to be fully integrated into Company operations and systems; create more costs than projected; divert management attention; create the potential of losing customer, supplier or other critical business relationships; and pose difficulties retaining employees.  The inability to successfully integrate new businesses may result in higher production costs, lost sales or otherwise negatively affect earnings and financial results.9If the Company is not able to successfully implement its strategic plan and growth initiatives, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and financial condition.The Company's ability to continue generating positive cash flow and profits will depend partly on its sustained successful execution of its strategic plan and growth initiatives, including making acquisitions and expanding into new adjacent markets and customers.  The Company's ability to succeed in its strategic plan and growth initiatives will require significant capital investment and management attention, which may result in the diversion of these resources from the core business and other business issues and opportunities.  Additionally, any new initiative is subject to certain risks, including customer acceptance, competition, the ability to manufacture the products on schedule and to specification, the ability to create the necessary supply chain and/or the ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel.  There is no assurance that the Company will be able to develop and successfully implement its strategic plan and growth initiatives to a point at which they will become profitable or generate positive cash flow. If the Company cannot successfully execute its strategic plan and growth initiatives, the Company's financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.Fiscal concerns may negatively impact worldwide credit conditions and could have an adverse effect on the Company's industries, businesses and financial condition.Concerns regarding fiscal policy could have a material adverse impact on worldwide economic conditions, the financial markets and availability of credit and, consequently, may negatively affect the Company's industries, businesses and overall financial condition.  Customers often finance purchases of the Company's products, particularly boats. Credit market conditions continued to improve in 2015, but remained less favorable overall than those in existence prior to the decline in marine retail demand.  While interest rates are generally lower, there continue to be fewer lenders, tighter underwriting and loan approval criteria, greater down payment requirements and negative loan equity, particularly in larger products.  If credit conditions worsen, and adversely affect the ability of customers to finance potential purchases at acceptable terms and interest rates, it could result in a decrease in sales of the Company's products or delay improvement in its sales.An inability of the Company's dealers and distributors to secure adequate access to capital could adversely affect the Company's sales.The Company's dealers require adequate liquidity to finance their operations, including purchasing the Company's products.  Dealers are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could unfavorably affect their liquidity positions, including, among other things, continued access to adequate financing sources on a timely basis on reasonable terms.  These sources of financing are vital to the Company's ability to sell products through its distribution network, particularly to its boat and engine dealers.  A significant portion of the Company's domestic and international boat and engine sales to dealers are financed through entities affiliated with GE Capital Corporation (GECC), including BAC (the Company's 49 percent owned joint venture, with the other 51 percent being owned by CDFV, a subsidiary of GECC), which provides floorplan financing to domestic marine dealers.  In 2015, GECC reached an agreement with Wells Fargo & Company to sell its Commercial Distribution Finance business, including CDFV and its interest in the BAC joint venture. The transaction is expected to be completed in 2016 and the Company does not anticipate it will have a material effect on BAC.However, a number of factors will continue to influence the availability and terms of financing offered by the Company's dealer floorplan financing providers, including: their ability to access certain capital markets, including the securitization and the commercial paper markets, and to fund their operations in a cost effective manner; the performance of their overall credit portfolios; their willingness to accept the risks associated with lending to marine dealers; and the overall creditworthiness of those dealers.  The Company's sales could be adversely affected if BAC were to be terminated or if financing terms change unfavorably.  This could require dealers to find alternative sources of financing, including the Company providing this financing directly to dealers, which could require additional capital to fund the associated receivables.The Company's financial results may be adversely affected if it is unable to maintain effective distribution.The Company relies on third-party dealers and distributors to sell the majority of its products, particularly in the marine businesses.  The ability to maintain a reliable network of dealers is essential to the Company's success.  The Company faces competition from other manufacturers in attracting and retaining distributors and independent boat dealers. A significant deterioration in the number or effectiveness of the Company's dealers and distributors could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial results.Weakening demand for marine products could adversely affect the financial performance of the Company's dealers.  In particular, reduced cash flow from decreases in sales and tightening credit markets may impair dealers' ability to fund operations.  Inability to fund operations can force dealers to cease business, and the Company may be unable to obtain alternate distribution in the vacated market.  An inability to obtain alternate distribution could unfavorably affect the Company's net sales 10through reduced market presence.  If conditions were to worsen, the Company anticipates that dealer failures or voluntary market exits could increase, especially if overall retail demand materially declines. Finally, labor disruption at major ports and shipping hubs around the world may adversely affect the Company and its distributors' ability to transport raw materials to its facilities and products to its distributors and end-use customers, potentially resulting in increased transportation costs and lost sales.Adverse economic, credit and capital market conditions could have a negative impact on the Company's financial results.The Company does not frequently rely on short-term capital markets to meet its working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, pay dividends or fund employee benefit programs; however, the Company does maintain short-term borrowing facilities which can be used to meet these capital requirements.  In addition, over the long term, the Company may determine that it is necessary to access the capital markets to refinance existing long-term indebtedness or for other initiatives.Adverse global economic conditions, market volatility and heightened governmental regulation could lead to volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets.  This could adversely affect the Company's ability to access capital and credit markets or increase the cost to do so, which could have a negative impact on its business, financial results and competitive position.Inventory reductions by major dealers, retailers and independent boat builders could adversely affect the Company's financial results.The Company and its dealers, retailers and other distributors could decide to reduce the number of units they hold, particularly if demand trails forecasted levels or if new product introductions are expected to replace older products.  Such efforts tend to result in wholesale sales reductions in excess of retail sales reductions and would likely result in lower production levels of the Company's products, thus resulting in lower rates of absorption of fixed costs in the Company's manufacturing facilities and lower margins. While actions taken continue to keep dealer inventories at appropriate levels, potential future inventory reductions by dealers and independent boat builder customers could impair the Company's future sales and results of operations.The Company may be required to repurchase inventory or accounts of certain dealers.The Company has agreements with certain third-party finance companies to provide financing to the Company's customers to enable the purchase of its products.  In connection with these agreements, the Company either may have obligations to repurchase the Company's products from the finance company, or may have recourse obligations to the finance company on the dealer’s receivables.  These obligations may be triggered if the Company's dealers default on their debt obligations to the finance companies.The Company's maximum contingent obligation to repurchase inventory and its maximum contingent recourse obligations on customer receivables have been reduced since the recession and are less than the total balances of dealer financings outstanding under these programs, as the Company's obligations under certain of these arrangements are subject to caps, or are limited based on the age of product.  The Company's risk related to these arrangements is mitigated by the proceeds it receives on the resale of repurchased product to other dealers, or by recoveries on receivables purchased under the recourse obligations.The Company's inventory repurchase obligations relate primarily to the inventory floorplan credit facilities of the Company's boat and engine dealers. The Company's actual historical repurchase experience related to these repurchase arrangements has been substantially less than the Company's maximum contractual obligations. If dealers file for bankruptcy or cease operations, the Company could incur losses associated with the repurchase of the Company's products.  In addition, as the repurchases may be triggered by dealer bankruptcies, the Company's net sales and earnings may be unfavorably affected as a result of reduced market coverage and the associated decline in sales.Declines in marine industry demand could cause an increase in future repurchase activity, or could require the Company to incur losses in excess of established reserves.  In addition, the Company's cash flow and loss experience could be adversely affected if repurchased inventory is not successfully distributed to other dealers in a timely manner, or if the recovery rate on the resale of the product declines.  The finance companies could require changes in repurchase or recourse terms that would result in an increase in the Company's contractual contingent obligations.The loss of key customers or critical suppliers could harm the Company's business.If the Company were to experience the loss of a key customer, its business could be negatively affected in a significant way.  Similarly, if one of the Company's most critical suppliers were to close its operations, cease manufacturing or otherwise fail to deliver an essential component necessary to the Company's manufacturing operations, it could have a detrimental effect on the Company's ability to manufacture and sell its products, resulting in an interruption in business operations and/or a loss of sales.  Additionally, certain customers may negotiate more favorable pricing of Company products. In an effort to mitigate the risk 11associated with reliance on such accounts and suppliers, the Company continually works to monitor such relationships, maintain a complete and competitive product lineup and identify alternative suppliers for key components. The Company's success depends upon the continued strength of its brands.The Company believes that its brands, including Mercury, Life Fitness, Sea Ray, Boston Whaler and Lund, significantly contribute to the Company's success, and that maintaining and enhancing the brands are important to expanding the Company's customer base.  Failure to continue to promote and protect the Company's brands may adversely affect the Company's business and results of operations.  Further, in connection with the divestiture of the bowling businesses, the Company licensed certain trademarks and servicemarks, including use of the name “Brunswick,” to the acquiring companies.  The Company's reputation may be adversely affected by the purchasers' inappropriate use of the marks or of the name Brunswick, including potential negative publicity, loss of confidence or other damage to its image due to this licensed use.  The Company has a fixed cost base that can affect its profitability in a declining sales environment.The fixed cost levels of operating production facilities can put pressure on profit margins when sales and production decline.  The Company has maintained discipline over its fixed cost base during the economic recovery; however, the Company's profitability is dependent, in part, on its ability to spread fixed costs over an increasing number of products sold and shipped, and if the Company is required to reduce its rate of production, gross margins could be negatively affected. Consequently, decreased demand or the need to reduce inventories can lower the Company's ability to absorb fixed costs and materially impact its results.Successfully managing the expansion of its manufacturing footprint is critical to the Company's operating and financial results.Over the past three years, the Company has made strategic capital investments in capacity expansion activities that will enable the affected businesses to successfully capture growth opportunities and enhance product offerings.  Recently, the Company reactivated its Sykes Creek manufacturing facility in Merritt Island, Florida, and has initiated or completed expansion activities at its facilities in Edgewater and Palm Coast, Florida; Ramsey, Minnesota; Fond du Lac, Wisconsin; Petit-Rechain, Belgium; and Kiskoros, Hungary.  The Company must carefully manage these capital improvement projects and expansions to ensure they meet cost targets, comply with applicable environmental, safety and other regulations and uphold high-quality workmanship.  Moving production to a different plant or expanding capacity at an existing facility involves risks, including difficulties initiating production within the cost and timeframe estimated, supplying product to customers when expected and attracting sufficient numbers of skilled workers to handle additional production demands.  The inability to successfully implement the Company's manufacturing footprint initiatives could adversely affect its ability to meet customer demand for products and could increase the cost of production versus projections, both of which could result in a significant adverse impact on operating and financial results.  Additionally, plants experiencing demand increases may face manufacturing inefficiencies, additional expenses, including higher wages, and cost inefficiencies, which could exceed projections and negatively impact financial results.The Company relies on third-party suppliers for the supply of the raw materials, parts and components necessary to manufacture its products.  The Company's financial results may be adversely affected by an increase in cost, disruption of supply, shortage or defect in raw materials, parts or product components.Outside suppliers and contract manufacturers provide the Company with raw materials used in the Company's manufacturing processes, including oil, aluminum, copper, steel and resins, as well as product parts and components.  The prices for these raw materials, parts and components fluctuate depending on market conditions and, in some instances, commodity prices.  Substantial increases in the prices of the Company's raw materials, parts and components would increase the Company's operating costs, and could reduce its profitability if the Company could not recoup the increased costs through higher product prices.  In addition, some components used in the Company's manufacturing processes, including certain engine components, furniture, upholstery and boat windshields are available from a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers.  Operational and financial difficulties that these or other suppliers may face in the future could adversely affect their ability to supply the Company with the parts and components it needs, which could significantly disrupt the Company's operations.  It may be difficult to find a replacement supplier for a limited or sole source raw material, part or component without significant delay or on commercially reasonable terms.  In addition, an uncorrected defect or supplier's variation in a raw material, part or component, either unknown to the Company or incompatible with the Company's manufacturing process, could harm the Company's ability to manufacture products.  Some of the risks that could disrupt the Company's operations, impair the Company's ability to deliver products to the Company's customers and negatively affect the Company's financial results include: an increase in the cost of, defects in or a sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of some of these raw materials, parts or products that may be caused by delayed start-up periods the Company's suppliers experience as they increase production efforts; financial pressures on the Company's suppliers 12due to a weakening economy or unfavorable conditions in other end markets; a deterioration of the Company's relationships with suppliers; or events such as natural disasters, power outages or labor strikes.  In addition to the risks described above regarding interruption of supplies, which are exacerbated in the case of single-source suppliers, the exclusive supplier of a key component potentially could exert significant bargaining power over price, quality, warranty claims or other terms.The Company's manufacturing operations increased production in 2015 and are expected to continue to do so in 2016 and, consequently, the Company's need for raw materials and supplies will increase. The Company's suppliers must be prepared to ramp up operations and, in many cases, hire additional workers and/or expand capacity in order to fulfill the orders placed by the Company and other customers.  The Company experienced periodic supply shortages in 2015.  The Company continues to work to address this issue by identifying alternative suppliers, working to secure adequate inventories of critical supplies and continually monitoring the capabilities of its supplier base.  In the future, however, the Company may experience shortages of, delayed delivery of and/or increased prices for key materials, parts and supplies that are essential to its manufacturing operations.The Company's pension funding requirements and expenses are affected by certain factors outside its control, including the performance of plan assets, the discount rate used to value liabilities, actuarial data and experience and legal and regulatory changes.The Company's funding obligations and pension expense for its four U.S. qualified pension plans are driven by the performance of assets set aside in trusts for these plans, the discount rate used to value the plans’ liabilities, actuarial data and experience and legal and regulatory funding requirements.  Changes in these factors could have an adverse impact on the Company's results of operations, liquidity or shareholders’ equity.  In addition, a portion of the Company's pension plan assets are invested in equity securities, which can experience significant declines if economic conditions or financial markets weaken.  The level of the Company's funding of its qualified pension plan liabilities was approximately 74 percent as of December 31, 2015. The Company's future pension expenses and funding requirements could increase significantly due to the effect of adverse changes in the discount rate and asset levels along with a decline in the estimated return on plan assets. In addition, as a result of changes in regulations, legal changes could require the Company to make increased contributions to the pension plans; these contributions could be material and negatively affect the Company's cash flow.The Company is currently mitigating these risks by transitioning the asset allocation in the pensions to a greater percentage of fixed income investments and by lowering plan liabilities through the offering of lump-sum settlements to certain plan participants and transferring obligations to a third party through annuity purchases. The timing and amount of the Company's share repurchases are subject to a number of uncertainties.During the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company announced that its Board of Directors had authorized the discretionary repurchase of up to $200 million of the Company's outstanding common stock, to be systematically completed in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions over approximately a two-year period.  In 2016, the Board increased the Company's existing share repurchase authorization by $300 million.  The amount and timing of share repurchases will be based on a variety of factors.  Important considerations that could cause the Company to limit, suspend or delay the Company's stock repurchases include unfavorable market conditions, the trading price of the Company's common stock, the nature of other investment opportunities available to the Company from time to time and the availability of cash. If the Company delays, limits or suspends the Company's stock repurchase program, the Company's stock price and earnings per share may be negatively affected.Higher energy and fuel costs can affect the Company's results.Higher energy and fuel costs result in increases in operating expenses at the Company's manufacturing facilities and in the cost of shipping products to customers.  In addition, increases in energy costs can adversely affect the pricing and availability of petroleum-based raw materials such as resins and foam that are used in many of the Company's marine products.  Also, higher fuel prices may have an adverse effect on demand for marine retail products, as they increase the cost of boat ownership and possibly affect product usage.  The Company's profitability may suffer as a result of competitive pricing and other pressures.The introduction of lower-priced alternative products by other companies can hurt the Company's competitive position in all of its businesses.  The Company is constantly subject to competitive pressures in which predominantly international manufacturers may pursue a strategy of aggressive pricing, particularly during periods when local currency weakens versus the U.S. dollar.  Such pricing pressure may limit the Company's ability to increase prices for its products in response to raw material and other cost increases and negatively affect the Company's profit margins.13In addition, international boat builders continue to expand distribution in the U.S. markets, mainly in the large fiberglass boat segment, thereby introducing additional product options into a market in which the Company believes itself to be a market leader.  The market for large boats expanded in 2015, partially due to the success of the Company's new product offerings, but  as these new entrants introduce potentially lower cost product alternatives, demand could be diverted away from the Company's  premium products. Finally, the Company's independent boat builder customers may react negatively to potential competition for their products from Brunswick’s own boat brands, which can lead them to purchase marine engines and marine engine supplies from competing marine engine manufacturers and may negatively affect demand for the Company's products.The Company's ability to remain competitive depends on the successful introduction of new product offerings and the ability to meet customer expectations.The Company believes that its customers rigorously evaluate manufacturers' quality and capability to innovate and develop new products when making purchasing decisions.  The Company's ability to remain competitive and meet its growth objectives may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development, such as an inability to develop viable new products, gain market acceptance of new products, generate sufficient capital to fund new product development or obtain adequate intellectual property protection for new products. To meet ever-changing consumer demands, timing of market entry and pricing of new products are critical.  As a result, the Company may not be able to introduce new products necessary to remain competitive in all markets that it serves.  Furthermore, the Company must deliver quality products that meet or exceed its customers' expectations regarding product quality and after-sales service.The Company's business operations could be negatively impacted by the failure or a breach of its information technology systems.The Company manages its global business operations through a variety of information technology (IT) systems which it continually enhances to increase efficiency and security.  These systems govern all aspects of the Company's operations around the world.  The Company is dependent on these systems for commercial transactions, customer interactions and image projection.  Some of the systems are based on legacy technology and operate with a minimal level of available support.  Although the Company has invested in strategies to prevent a failure or breach, if one of these legacy systems or another of the Company's key IT systems were to fail or if the Company's IT systems were unable to communicate effectively, this could result in missed or delayed sales or lost opportunities for cost reduction or efficient cash management.  The Company exchanges information with hundreds of trading partners across all aspects of its commercial operations.  Any breach in security or disruption of the communications could result in erroneous transactions or loss of reputation and confidence.  The Company has numerous portals to engage in e-commerce and e-marketing and its systems may also contain personal information in connection with human resources, financial services or other business operations; therefore, the Company must remain diligent in protecting itself from malicious cyber attacks.  A successful cyber attack or data security breach could result in a disruption of services, fraudulent transactions or disclosure of confidential information.  This could negatively affect the Company's relationships with its customers or trading partners, lead to potential claims against the Company and damage its image and reputation.The Company competes with a variety of other activities for consumers' scarce discretionary income and leisure time.The vast majority of the Company's products are used for recreational purposes, and demand for the Company's products can be adversely affected by competition from other activities that occupy consumers' time, including other forms of recreation, religious, cultural and community activities. Additionally, any pressures or slow growth in consumers' discretionary income may influence consumers' willingness to purchase and enjoy the Company's products.The Company manufactures and sells products that create exposure to potential product liability, warranty liability, personal injury and property damage claims and litigation.The Company's products may expose it to potential product liability, warranty liability, personal injury or property damage claims relating to the use of those products. The Company's manufacturing footprint actions and production of new products could result in product quality issues, thereby increasing the risk of litigation and potential liability. To address this risk, the Company has established a global, enterprise-wide program charged with the responsibility for addressing, reviewing and reporting on product integrity issues.  Historically, the resolution of such claims has not materially adversely affected the Company's business, and the Company maintains what it believes to be adequate insurance coverage to mitigate a portion of these risks.  However, the Company may experience material losses in the future, incur significant costs to defend claims or issue product recalls, or experience claims in excess of its insurance coverage or that are not covered by insurance.  Furthermore, the Company's reputation may be adversely affected by such claims, whether or not successful, including potential negative publicity about its products. The Company 14records reserves for known potential liabilities, but there is the possibility that actual losses may exceed these reserves and therefore negatively impact earnings.If the Company's intellectual property protection is inadequate, others may be able to use its technologies and thereby impair the Company's ability to compete, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company, its financial condition and results of operations.The Company regards much of the technology underlying its products as proprietary.  The Company relies on a combination of patents, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws; employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements; and other contracts to establish and protect its technology and other intellectual property rights.  The steps the Company takes to protect its proprietary technology may be inadequate to prevent misappropriation of the Company's technology, or third parties may independently develop similar technology.   Agreements containing protections may be breached or terminated, the Company may not have adequate remedies for any such breach and existing patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws may afford limited protection.  Policing unauthorized use of the Company's intellectual property is difficult, particularly in many regions outside the United States.  A third party could copy or otherwise obtain and use the Company's products or technology without authorization. The Company may be required to litigate to defend against infringement claims or to protect its intellectual property rights, which could result in substantial cost and divert management's attention.  Further, the Company might not prevail in such litigation and it may be forced to seek licenses or royalty arrangements from third parties, which the Company may not be able to obtain on reasonable terms, or the Company may be forced to stop using products that included the challenged intellectual property, which could harm its business.Compliance with environmental, zoning and other obligations under various laws and regulations will increase costs and may reduce demand for the Company's products.The Company is subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including product safety, environmental, health and safety and other regulations.  While the Company believes that it maintains all requisite licenses and permits and that it is in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, a failure to satisfy these and other regulatory requirements could cause the Company to incur fines or penalties, and compliance could increase the cost of operations.  The adoption of additional laws, rules and regulations, including higher emissions standards, could increase the Company's manufacturing costs, increase consumer pricing and reduce consumer demand for the Company's products.Environmental restrictions, boat plant emission restrictions and permitting and zoning requirements can limit production capacity, access to water for boating, marina and storage space.  In addition, certain jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States require or are considering requiring a license to operate a recreational boat.  While such licensing requirements are not expected to be unduly restrictive, they may deter potential customers, thereby reducing the Company's sales.  Furthermore, regulations allowing the sale of fuel containing higher levels of ethanol for automobiles, which is not appropriate or intended for use in marine engines, may nonetheless result in increased warranty, service costs, product dissatisfaction and other claims against the Company if boaters mistakenly use this fuel in marine engines, causing damage to and the degradation of components in their marine engines.The Company's manufacturing processes involve the use, handling, storage and contracting for recycling or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes.  Accordingly, the Company is subject to regulations regarding these substances, and the misuse or mishandling of such substances could expose it to liabilities, including claims for property or natural resources damages or personal injury, or fines.  The Company is also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property.  If a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from any of the Company's current or former properties or another location where it has disposed of hazardous materials, the Company may be held liable for the contamination, regardless of knowledge or whether it was at fault in connection with the release, and the amount of such liability could be material.Additionally, the Company is subject to laws governing its relationship with its employees, including, but not limited to, employment obligations as a federal contractor and employee wage, hour and benefit issues, such as pension funding and health care benefits.  Changes to legislation or regulations governing its employment obligations could increase the cost of the Company's operations.Increases in income tax rates or changes in income tax laws or enforcement could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial results.Changes in domestic and international tax legislation could expose the Company to additional tax liability or possibly require changes which lower deferred tax asset values.  Although the Company carefully monitors changes in tax laws and works to mitigate the impact of proposed changes, such changes may negatively impact the Company's financial results.  In addition, any increase in individual income tax rates would negatively affect the Company’s potential customers' discretionary income and could 15decrease the demand for its products.  Finally, governments in many jurisdictions are increasing their audit activity and are engaging in other projects, such as those related to alleged base erosion and profit shifting.  This increase in activity involves increased costs to the Company for having to resolve these potential disputes and from the potential additional taxes which may be assessed.An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill, trade names and other long-lived assets could negatively affect the Company's consolidated results of operations and net worth.Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as the Company's trade names, are recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition and are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise.  In evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill and trade names, the Company makes assumptions regarding future operating performance, business trends and market and economic conditions.  Such analyses further require the Company to make certain assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates.  There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and in applying these factors to the assessment of goodwill and trade name recoverability.  The Company could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill or trade names prior to the annual assessment if it experiences disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, a divestiture of a significant component of the Company's business or market capitalization declines.The Company also continually evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of its definite-lived intangible assets and other long-lived assets may warrant revision or whether the remaining balance of such assets may not be recoverable.  The Company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flow over the remaining life of the asset in measuring whether the asset is recoverable.If the future operating performance of the Company's reporting units is not sufficient, the Company could be required to record non-cash impairment charges.  Impairment charges could substantially affect the Company's reported earnings in the periods such charges are recorded.  In addition, impairment charges could indicate a reduction in business value which could limit the Company's ability to obtain adequate financing in the future.  As of December 31, 2015, goodwill was approximately 9 percent of total assets and included $272.5 million of goodwill related to the Life Fitness segment and $26.2 million of goodwill related to the Marine Engine segment.Some of the Company's operations are conducted by joint ventures that are not operated solely for its benefit.Some of the Company's operations are carried on through jointly owned companies such as BAC, Bella and Tohatsu Marine Corporation.  With respect to these joint ventures, the Company shares ownership and management responsibility of these companies with one or more parties who may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities or resources as the Company.  These joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of all co-owners, rather than for the Company's exclusive benefit. A significant portion of the Company's revenue is derived from international sources, which exposes it to additional uncertainty.The Company intends to continue to expand its international operations and customer base as part of its growth strategy.  Sales outside the United States, especially in emerging markets, are subject to various risks, including government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions, foreign currency effects, tariffs, customs duties, inflation, difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems, compliance with international laws, treaties and regulations and unexpected changes in regulatory environments, disruptions in distribution, dependence on foreign personnel and unions, as well as economic and social instability.  In addition, there may be tax inefficiencies in repatriating cash from non-U.S. subsidiaries.  If the Company continues to expand its business globally, its success will depend, in part, on the Company's ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks.  These and other factors may have a material impact on the Company's international operations or its business as a whole.The Company's operations are dependent on its ability to attract and retain key contributors and on the successful implementation of its succession plans.Much of the Company's future success depends on, among other factors, its ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, including executive officers.  If the Company is not successful in its efforts, the Company may be unable to meet its operating goals and plans, which may impact the Company's financial results.  In order to manage this risk, the Company performs an annual review of management succession plans with the Board of Directors, including reviewing executive officer and other key positions.  The most recent executive officer transitions were planned and were subject to this process.  The Company believes that this process  substantially mitigates the risk associated with these transitions.    16Adverse weather conditions can have a negative effect on marine revenues.Changes in seasonal weather conditions can have a significant effect on the Company's operating and financial results, especially in the marine businesses.  Sales of the Company's marine products are generally stronger just before and during spring and summer, and favorable weather during these months generally has had a positive effect on consumer demand.  Conversely, unseasonably cool weather, excessive rainfall or drought conditions during these periods can reduce demand.  Hurricanes and other storms can result in the disruption of the Company's distribution channel, operations or supply chain.  Additionally, in the event that climate change occurs, which could result in environmental changes including, but not limited to, severe weather, rising sea levels or reduced access to water, the Company's business could be disrupted and negatively affected.Instability in locations where the Company maintains a significant presence could adversely impact the Company's business operations.The Company has established a global presence, with manufacturing, sales, distribution and retail locations around the world.  Changing conditions in those locations, including, but not limited to, political instability, civil unrest and an increase in criminal activity, could have a negative impact on the Company's local manufacturing and other business operations.  Decreased stability in those regions where the Company conducts business poses a risk of business interruption and delays in shipments of materials, components and finished goods, as well as a risk of decreased local retail demand for the Company's products in those regions.Catastrophic events, including natural and environmental disasters, could have a negative effect on the Company's operations and financial results.The occurrence of natural and environmental disasters, including hurricanes, floods, earthquakes and environmental spills could decrease consumer demand for and sales of the Company's products.  If such an occurrence takes place in one of Brunswick's major sales markets, the Company could experience a decrease in sales.  Additionally, if such an event occurs near the Company's business, manufacturing facilities or key suppliers' facilities, the affected locations could experience an interruption in business operations and/or their operating systems.  The Company could be uniquely affected by a catastrophic event due to the location of certain of its boat facilities in coastal Florida and the size of the manufacturing operation in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin"

The Company believes its Marine Engine segment is a world leader in the manufacturing and sale of recreational marine engines and marine parts and accessories.  In 2014, Mercury Marine celebrated its 75th anniversary. Mercury Marine manufactures and markets a full range of outboard engines, sterndrive propulsion systems and inboard engines under the Mercury, Mercury MerCruiser, Mariner, Mercury Racing, Mercury Sport Jet and Mercury Jet Drive, MotorGuide, Sea Pro, Axius and Zeus brand names. In addition, Mercury Marine manufactures and markets marine parts and accessories under the Quicksilver, Mercury Precision Parts, Mercury Propellers, Attwood, Whale, Land 'N' Sea, Kellogg Marine Supply, Diversified Marine Products, Bell Recreational Products, Sea Choice and MotorGuide brand names, including marine electronics and control integration systems, steering systems, instruments, controls, propellers, trolling motors, fuel systems, service parts and marine lubricants. Mercury Marine also supplies integrated, high-speed diesel propulsion systems to the worldwide recreational and commercial marine markets.Mercury Marine's outboard engines, sterndrive engines and inboard engines are sold to independent boat builders, local, state and foreign governments, and to the Company's Boat segment. In addition, Mercury Marine's outboard engines are sold to end-users through a global network of more than 5,500 marine dealers and distributors, specialty marine retailers and marine service centers. Mercury Marine manufactures four-stroke outboard engine models ranging from 2.5 to 400 horsepower and two-stroke OptiMax outboard engines, all of which feature Mercury's direct fuel injection (DFI) technology, ranging from 75 to 300 horsepower.  All of these low-emission engines are in compliance with current U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requirements.  Mercury Marine's four-stroke outboard engines include Verado, a collection of supercharged outboards ranging from 150 to 350 horsepower, and Mercury Marine's naturally aspirated four-stroke outboards, ranging from 2.5 to 150 horsepower, including the 75 to 115  horsepower FourStroke, introduced in 2014, which has already become known for its light weight, fuel efficiency and performance. Mercury Marine also manufactures two-stroke, non-DFI engines for certain markets outside the United States.  In addition, most of Mercury's sterndrive and inboard engines are now available with catalyst exhaust monitoring and treatment systems, and all are compliant with environmental regulations adopted by the State of California, effective January 1, 2008, and by the EPA, effective January 1, 2010.1Mercury Marine and Mercury Racing manufacture inboard and sterndrive engine models ranging from 115 to 1,650 horsepower.  Mercury's new 4.5-liter 250 horsepower sterndrive engine, designed and purpose-built by Mercury for marine use, was named the top innovative product in its category in September 2014 at the International Boatbuilders’ Exhibition and Conference in Tampa, Florida. To promote advanced propulsion systems with improved handling, performance and efficiency, Mercury Marine manufactures and markets advanced boat steering and engine control systems under the brand names of Zeus and Axius. Mercury Marine's gasoline sterndrive and outboard engines are produced domestically in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, with outboard engines also produced internationally in China and Japan.  Mercury Marine manufactures 40, 50 and 60 horsepower four-stroke outboard engines in a facility in China, and produces smaller outboard engines in Japan pursuant to a joint venture with its partner, Tohatsu Corporation. Mercury Marine sources engine components from a global supply base and manufactures additional engine component parts at its Fond du Lac facility and plants in Florida and Mexico.  Mercury Marine also operates a remanufacturing business for engines and service parts in Wisconsin.  In addition, Mercury Marine has an equity ownership interest in Bella-Veneet Oy, which manufactures boats under the brand names Bella, Flipper and Aquador in Finland.  On June 16, 2014, the Company acquired 100 percent of privately held Whale, which is based in Bangor, Northern Ireland, and is a manufacturer of water movement and heating systems for the marine, recreational vehicle, industrial and other markets.  The Company believes this acquisition will allow the Company to more fully compete across a number of parts and accessories product categories, enable entry into attractive adjacent markets and expand the global presence of the marine service, parts and accessories businesses.  On July 31, 2014, the Company acquired 100 percent of privately held Bell Industries Recreational Products Group, Inc. (Bell), which is based in Eagan, Minnesota.  Bell is a distributor of parts and accessories to the marine, recreational vehicle and powersports markets, serving primarily the Upper Midwest of the U.S. The Company believes this acquisition will allow the Company to solidify its footprint in the Upper Midwest with locations in Minnesota, Michigan and Wisconsin, enhance its growth of its parts and accessories businesses, expand the depth and breadth of its product portfolio and enable entry into attractive adjacent markets.  Whale and Bell are managed as part of the Company’s marine service, parts and accessories businesses within the Marine Engine segment.    Mercury Marine's parts and accessories distribution and products businesses include: Land 'N' Sea, Kellogg Marine Supply, Diversified Marine Products, Bell Recreational Products, Attwood Marine and Whale. These businesses are leading manufacturers and distributors of marine parts and accessories throughout North America and Europe, offering same-day or next-day delivery service to a broad array of marine service facilities.  Inter-company sales to the Company's Boat segment represented approximately 12 percent of Mercury Marine's sales in 2014.  Domestic demand for the Marine Engine segment's products is seasonal, with sales generally highest in the second calendar quarter of the year. Boat SegmentThe Boat segment consists of the Brunswick Boat Group (Boat Group), which manufactures and markets the following products: fiberglass pleasure boats; luxury yachts, yachts and sport yachts; offshore fishing boats; aluminum fishing boats; pontoon boats; deck boats and inflatable boats.  The Company believes that its Boat Group, which had net sales of $1,135.8 million during 2014, is a world leader in the manufacturing and sale of pleasure motorboats. The Boat Group manages Brunswick's boat brands; evaluates and optimizes the Boat segment's boat portfolio; promotes recreational boating services and activities to enhance the consumer experience and dealer profitability; and speeds the introduction of new technologies into the boat manufacturing and design processes. The Boat Group includes the following boat brands: Sea Ray L-Class yachts, yachts, sport yachts, sport cruisers and runabouts; Bayliner sport cruisers and runabouts; Meridian yachts; Boston Whaler and Lund fiberglass fishing boats; and Crestliner, Cypress Cay, Harris, Lowe, Lund and Princecraft aluminum fishing, utility, pontoon boats and deck boats. The Boat Group also includes a commercial and governmental sales unit that sells products to commercial customers, as well as to the United States government and state, local and foreign governments. The Boat Group procures most of its outboard engines, gasoline sterndrive engines and gasoline inboard engines from Brunswick's Marine Engine segment.The Boat Group also includes several Brunswick boat brands based in Europe and Asia-Pacific, which include Quicksilver, Uttern and Rayglass (Protector and Legend), which are typically equipped with engines manufactured by Mercury Marine and often include other parts and accessories supplied by Mercury Marine. 2The Boat Group operates manufacturing facilities in Florida, Indiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Tennessee, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand and Portugal, and owns an inactive manufacturing facility in North Carolina.  The Boat Group utilizes contract manufacturing facilities in Poland.  In 2014, the Boat Group divested idle operating facilities in Ashland City and Knoxville, Tennessee. The Boat Group's products are sold to end-users through a global network of approximately 3,000 dealers and distributors, each of which carries one or more of Brunswick's boat brands. Sales to the Boat Group's largest dealer, MarineMax Inc., which has multiple locations and carries a number of the Boat Group's product lines, represented approximately 18 percent of Boat Group sales in 2014. Domestic demand for pleasure boats is seasonal, with sales generally highest in the second calendar quarter of the year.Fitness SegmentBrunswick's Fitness segment is comprised of its Life Fitness division (Life Fitness), which designs, manufactures and markets a full line of reliable, high-quality cardiovascular fitness equipment (including treadmills, total body cross-trainers, stair climbers and stationary exercise bicycles) and strength-training equipment under the Life Fitness and Hammer Strength brands.  The Fitness segment also includes Brunswick's billiards business which was previously a part of Brunswick's former Bowling and Billiards segment.The Company believes that its Fitness segment, which had net sales of $769.3 million during 2014, is the world's largest manufacturer of commercial fitness equipment and a leading manufacturer of high-quality consumer fitness equipment. Life Fitness' commercial sales customers include health clubs, corporations, schools and universities, hotels, professional sports teams and the military and governmental agencies.  Commercial sales are made to customers through Life Fitness' direct sales force, domestic dealers, and international distributors.  Consumer products are available at specialty retailers, select mass merchants, sporting goods stores, through international distributors, and on the Life Fitness Web site. The Fitness segment's billiards business was established in 1845 and is Brunswick's heritage business.  The billiards business designs and/or markets billiards tables, table tennis tables, air powered table hockey games and other gaming tables, as well as game room furniture and related accessories, under the Brunswick and Contender brands.The Fitness segment's principal manufacturing facilities are located in Illinois, Kentucky, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Hungary, with third party contract manufacturing partners in China and Taiwan.  Life Fitness distributes its products worldwide from regional warehouses and production facilities. Demand for Life Fitness products is seasonal, with sales generally highest in the fourth quarter of the year.Discontinued OperationsOn July 17, 2014, the Company entered into an agreement to sell its retail bowling business to AMF Bowling Centers, Inc. In connection with its decision to sell its bowling centers, the Company announced its intention to divest its bowling products business.   On December 31, 2012, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to exit its Hatteras and Cabo boat businesses. As a result of these actions, these businesses, which were previously recorded in the Bowling & Billiards segment and Boat segment, respectively, are being reported as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented.  The Company does not have or anticipate having any significant continuing involvement or continuing cash flows associated with these businesses. The assets and liabilities of these businesses met the accounting criteria to be classified as held for sale and have been aggregated and reported on separate lines of the Consolidated Balance Sheets for all periods presented.On September 18, 2014, the Company completed the sale of its retail bowling business to AMF Bowling Centers, Inc. as well as, in separate transactions, completed the sale of two retail bowling centers in California.  In August 2013, the Company completed the sale of its Hatteras and Cabo boat businesses.  Refer to Note 2 – Discontinued Operations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company's discontinued operations.Financial ServicesThe Company, through its Brunswick Financial Services Corporation subsidiary, owns a 49 percent interest in a joint venture, Brunswick Acceptance Company, LLC (BAC). CDF Ventures, LLC, a subsidiary of GE Capital Corporation, owns the remaining 51 percent. Under the terms of the joint venture agreement, BAC provides secured wholesale inventory floorplan financing to the Company's boat and engine dealers.  In March 2013, the term of the BAC joint venture was extended through December 31, 2016. The joint venture agreement 3contains provisions allowing for the renewal of the agreement or purchase of the other party's interest in the joint venture at the end of its term. Alternatively, either partner may terminate the agreement at the end of its term.  In June 2014, the joint venture agreement was amended to adjust a financial covenant that was conformed to the leverage ratio test contained in the Facility as described in Note 16 – Debt in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.Additionally, Brunswick offers financial services through Brunswick Product Protection Corporation, which provides marine dealers the opportunity to offer extended product warranties to retail customers, and through Blue Water Dealer Services, Inc., which provides retail financial services to marine dealers. Each company allows Brunswick to offer a more complete line of financial services to its boat and marine engine dealers and their customers. Refer to Note 10 – Financial Services in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about the Company's financial services. DistributionBrunswick utilizes distributors, dealers and retailers (Dealers) for the majority of its boat sales and significant portions of its sales of marine engine, fitness and billiards products. Brunswick has over 16,000 Dealers serving its business segments worldwide. Brunswick's marine Dealers typically carry one or more of the following product categories - boats, engines and related parts and accessories. Brunswick owns Land 'N' Sea, Kellogg Marine Supply, Diversified Marine Products and Bell Recreational Products, which comprise the primary North American parts and accessories distribution platforms for the Company's Marine Engine segment. We believe that these businesses, collectively, are the leading distributors of marine parts and accessories throughout North America, with 16 distribution warehouses located throughout the United States and Canada offering same-day or next-day delivery service to a broad array of marine service facilities and Dealers. Brunswick's Dealers are independent companies or proprietors that range in size from small, family-owned businesses to a large, publicly-traded corporation with substantial revenues and multiple locations. Some Dealers sell Brunswick's products exclusively, while a majority also carry competitors' products. Brunswick partners with its boat dealer network to improve quality, service, distribution and delivery of parts and accessories to enhance the boating customer's experience. Demand for a significant portion of Brunswick's products is seasonal, and a number of Brunswick's Dealers are relatively small and/or highly-leveraged. As a result, many Dealers require financial assistance to support their businesses, enabling them to provide stable channels for Brunswick's products. In addition to the financing offered by BAC, the Company may also provide its Dealers with assistance, including incentive programs, loan guarantees and inventory repurchase commitments, under which the Company is obligated to repurchase inventory from a finance company in the event of a Dealer's default. The Company believes that these arrangements are in its best interest; however, the financial support that the Company provides to its Dealers exposes the Company to credit and business risk. Brunswick's business units, along with BAC, maintain active credit operations to manage this financial exposure, and the Company continually seeks opportunities to sustain and improve the financial health of its various distribution channel partners. Refer to Note 13 – Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these arrangements.International OperationsBrunswick's sales to customers in markets other than the United States were $1,438.7 million (37 percent of net sales), $1,385.1 million (38 percent of net sales) and $1,347.6 million (39 percent of net sales) in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The Company transacts a portion of its sales in non-U.S. markets in local currencies, and the cost of its products is generally denominated in U.S. dollars. As a result, the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar affects the financial results of Brunswick's non-U.S. operations. 4Non-U.S. sales are set forth in Note 6 – Segment Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and are also included in the table below, which details Brunswick's non-U.S. sales by region:(in millions)2014 2013 2012Europe$533.5 $469.0 $439.4Canada302.4 312.6 310.2Asia-Pacific286.0 281.4 294.6Latin America219.0 234.6 217.3Africa & Middle East97.8 87.5 86.1Total$1,438.7 $1,385.1 $1,347.6Marine Engine segment non-U.S. sales represented approximately 48 percent of Brunswick's non-U.S. sales in 2014. The segment's principal non-U.S. operations include the following:•Distribution, sales, service and applications engineering offices in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand and Singapore; •    Sales or representative offices in China, Dubai, Finland, France, Italy, Norway, Russia, Sweden and Switzerland; •    A component manufacturing facility in Mexico;•An outboard engine assembly plant in Suzhou, China; •    An outboard engine assembly plant operated by a joint venture in Japan; and•   A parts and accessories manufacturing facility in Northern Ireland.Boat segment non-U.S. sales comprised approximately 26 percent of Brunswick's non-U.S. sales in 2014.  A portion of the Boat Group's products are manufactured or assembled in Brazil, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand and Portugal, as well as in boat plants owned and operated by third parties in Poland that perform contract manufacturing for the Company, and are sold worldwide through Dealers. The Boat Group has sales or import offices in Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland and Sweden.Fitness segment non-U.S. sales comprised approximately 26 percent of Brunswick's non-U.S. sales in 2014. Life Fitness sells its products worldwide and has sales and distribution centers in Brazil, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom. The Fitness segment manufactures strength-training equipment and select lines of cardiovascular equipment in Hungary for its international markets, and has relationships with contract manufacturers in China and Taiwan. Raw Materials and SuppliesBrunswick purchases a wide variety of raw materials from its supplier base, including aluminum, resins, oil and steel, as well as product parts and components, such as engine blocks and boat windshields. The prices for these raw materials, parts and components fluctuate depending on market conditions. Significant increases in the cost of such materials would raise the Company's production costs, which could reduce the Company's profitability if the Company did not recoup the increased costs through higher product prices. As Brunswick's manufacturing operations raised production levels in 2014, the Company's need for raw materials and supplies increased.  Continuing into 2015, Brunswick's suppliers will need to increase their manufacturing operations to meet the rising demand for their products and, in many cases, may need to hire additional workers in order to fulfill the orders placed by Brunswick and other customers. During 2014, the Company experienced some shortages, and delayed delivery, of certain materials, parts and supplies essential to its manufacturing operations. The Company has addressed and will continue to address this issue by identifying alternative suppliers, working to secure adequate inventories of critical supplies and continually monitoring the capabilities of its supplier base. The Company also continues to expand its global procurement operations to better leverage its purchasing power across its divisions and to improve supply chain and cost efficiencies. The Company mitigates its commodity price risk on certain raw material purchases by using derivatives to hedge exposure related to changes in commodity prices. 5Intellectual PropertyBrunswick has, and continues to obtain, patent rights covering certain features of its products and processes. By law, Brunswick's patent rights, which consist of patents and patent licenses, have limited lives and expire periodically. The Company believes that its patent rights are important to its competitive position in all of its business segments. In the Marine Engine segment, patent rights principally relate to features of outboard engines and inboard-outboard drives, hybrid drives and pod drives, including: die-cast powerheads; cooling and exhaust systems; drivetrain, clutch and gearshift mechanisms; boat/engine mountings; shock-absorbing tilt mechanisms; ignition systems; propellers; marine vessel control systems; fuel and oil injection systems; supercharged engines; outboard mid-section structures; segmented cowls; hydraulic trim, tilt and steering; screw compressor charge air cooling systems; a range of proprietary metal alloys and airflow silencers. In the Boat segment, patent rights principally relate to processes for manufacturing fiberglass hulls, decks and components for boat products, as well as patent rights related to interiors and other boat features and components. In the Fitness segment, patent rights principally relate to fitness equipment designs and components, including patents covering internal processes, programming functions, displays, design features and styling, as well as billiards table designs and components. The following are Brunswick's principal trademarks: Marine Engine Segment:  Attwood, Axius, Bell Recreational Products, Diversified Marine Products, Kellogg Marine Supply, Land 'N' Sea, Mariner, MercNET, MerCruiser, Mercury, Mercury Marine, Mercury Parts Express, Mercury Precision Parts, Mercury Propellers, Mercury Racing, MotorGuide, OptiMax, Quicksilver, Seachoice, SeaPro, SmartCraft, Sport Jet, Swivl-Eze, Valiant, Verado, Whale and Zeus.Boat Segment:  Bayliner, Boston Whaler, Crestliner, Cypress Cay, Harris, Lowe, Lund, Master Dealer, Meridian, Princecraft, Protector, Quicksilver, Rayglass, Sea Ray and Uttern.Fitness Segment:  Air Hockey, Brunswick, Contender, Flex Deck, Gold Crown, Hammer Strength, Lifecycle and Life Fitness.Brunswick's trademark rights have indefinite lives, and many are well known to the public and are considered to be valuable assets.Competitive Conditions and PositionThe Company believes that it has a reputation for quality in each of its highly competitive lines of business. Brunswick competes in its various markets by: utilizing efficient production techniques; developing and strengthening its leading brands; developing and promoting innovative technological advancements; undertaking effective marketing, advertising and sales efforts; providing high-quality, innovative products at competitive prices; and offering extensive aftermarket services. Strong competition exists in each of Brunswick's product groups, but no single enterprise competes with Brunswick in all product groups. In each product area, competitors range in size from large, highly-diversified companies to small, single-product businesses. Brunswick also indirectly competes with businesses that offer alternative leisure products or activities. The following summarizes Brunswick's competitive position in each segment: Marine Engine Segment:  The Company believes its Marine Engine segment is a world leader in the manufacturing and sale of recreational marine engines and marine parts and accessories.  The marine engine market is highly competitive among several major international companies that comprise the majority of the market, including Japanese-based outboard engine manufacturers, as well as several smaller companies including Chinese manufacturers. Competitive advantage in this segment is a function of product features, technological leadership, quality, service, pricing, performance and durability, along with effective promotion and distribution. Boat Segment:  The Company believes that its Boat Group is a world leader in the manufacturing and sale of pleasure motorboats.  There are several major manufacturers of pleasure and offshore fishing boats, along with hundreds of smaller manufacturers. Consequently, this business is both highly competitive and highly fragmented. The Company believes it has the broadest range of boat product offerings in the world, with boats ranging in size from 10 to 65 feet. In all of its boat operations, Brunswick competes on the basis of product features, technology, quality, brand strength, dealer service, pricing, performance, value, durability and styling, along with effective promotion and distribution.6 Fitness Segment:  The Company believes it is the world's largest manufacturer of commercial fitness equipment and a leading manufacturer of high-quality consumer fitness equipment and billiards tables. The fitness equipment industry is highly competitive among several major international companies that comprise the majority of the market.  The billiards industry continues to experience competitive pressure from low-cost billiards manufacturers outside the United States.  Many of the Company's fitness equipment offerings feature industry-leading product innovations, and the Company places significant emphasis on introducing new fitness equipment to the market. Competitive focus is also placed on product quality, technology, service, pricing, state-of-the-art biomechanics, and effective promotional activities.  Research and DevelopmentThe Company strives to improve its competitive position in all of its segments by continuously investing in research and development to drive innovation in its products and manufacturing technologies. Brunswick's research and development investments support the introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products. Research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were 3.1 percent, 3.2 percent and 3.0 percent in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.  Research and development expenses by segment are shown below:            (in millions)2014 2013 2012Marine Engine$72.5 $70.6 $61.5Boat23.7 22.4 20.2Fitness23.4 21.8 19.3Total$119.6 $114.8 $101.0Number of EmployeesThe number of employees worldwide is shown below by segment:     December 31, 2014 December 31, 2013 Total Union (domestic) Total Union (domestic)Marine Engine5,320 1,723 5,331 1,880Boat4,024 — 3,748 —Fitness (A)2,026 134 1,832 134Bowling (B)479 24 4,478 24Corporate316 — 312 —Total (C)12,165 1,881 15,701 2,038(A)2014 and 2013 employee numbers include employees of the billiards business.(B)2014 and 2013 employee numbers include employees of the bowling products business.  2013 employee numbers include employees of the retail bowling business which was divested effective September 18, 2014.(C)All employee numbers exclude temporary employees.The Company believes that the relationships between its employees, the labor unions and the Company remain stable. Environmental RequirementsRefer to Note 13 – Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of certain environmental proceedings.Available InformationBrunswick maintains an Internet Web site at http://www.brunswick.com that includes links to Brunswick's Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports (SEC Reports).

The Company's operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, which could adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of the Company's common stock. Worldwide economic conditions have adversely affected the Company's industries, businesses and results of operations and may continue to do so.General worldwide economic conditions continue to be challenging as economies continue to recover from the effects caused by the subprime lending and general credit market crisis, collateral effects on the finance and banking industries, slower economic activity, variable consumer confidence, and weak business conditions.  In times of economic uncertainty and contraction, consumers tend to have less discretionary income and to defer expenditures for discretionary items, which adversely affects the Company's financial performance, especially in its marine businesses.  A majority of the Company's businesses are cyclical in nature and are highly sensitive to personal discretionary spending levels, and their success is dependent upon favorable economic conditions, the overall level of consumer confidence and personal income levels.Demand for the Company's marine products has been influenced by weak economic conditions, low consumer confidence, high unemployment and increased market volatility worldwide.  Although increases have not been experienced in all product segments and geographic markets, the Company estimates that retail unit sales of powerboats in the United States again increased modestly during 2014.  However, unit sales remain down significantly from historical levels, particularly in the fiberglass sterndrive boat segment. Any deterioration in general economic conditions that diminishes consumer confidence or discretionary income may further reduce the Company's sales or the Company may decide to sell its products at a discount, thus adversely affecting its financial results, including increasing the potential for future impairment charges.  The Company cannot predict the timing or strength of economic recovery, either worldwide or in the specific markets where it competes.Fiscal concerns may negatively impact worldwide credit conditions and could have an adverse effect on the Company's industries, businesses and financial condition.Concerns regarding fiscal policy could have a material adverse impact on worldwide economic conditions, the financial markets and the availability of credit and, consequently, may negatively affect the Company's industries, businesses and overall financial condition.  Although consumer credit markets have improved, consumer credit market conditions continue to influence demand, especially for marine products, and may continue to do so.Customers often finance purchases of the Company's products, particularly boats. Credit market conditions continued to improve in 2014, but remained less favorable overall than those in existence prior to the decline in marine retail demand. While interest rates are generally lower, there continue to be fewer lenders, tighter underwriting and loan approval criteria, greater down payment requirements and negative loan equity, particularly in larger products.  If credit conditions worsen, and adversely affect the ability of customers to finance potential purchases at acceptable terms and interest rates, it could result in a decrease in sales of the Company's products or delay any improvement in its sales.The inability of the Company's dealers and distributors to secure adequate access to capital could adversely affect the Company's sales.The Company's dealers require adequate liquidity to finance their operations, including purchases of the Company's products.  Dealers are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could unfavorably affect their liquidity positions, including, among other things, continued access to adequate financing sources on a timely basis on reasonable terms.  These sources of financing are vital to the Company's ability to sell products through the Company's distribution network, particularly to its boat and engine dealers.  During the credit crisis which ensued before, during and after the 2009 recession, several third-party floorplan lenders ceased their lending operations or materially reduced their exposure.  A significant portion of the Company's domestic and international boat and engine sales to dealers are financed through entities affiliated with GE Capital Corporation (GECC), including BAC (the Company's 49 percent owned joint venture, with the other 51 percent being owned by CDFV, a subsidiary of GECC),  which provides floorplan financing to domestic marine dealers.The availability and terms of financing offered by the Company's dealer floorplan financing providers will continue to be influenced by a number of factors including: their ability to access certain capital markets, including the securitization and the commercial paper markets, and to fund their operations in a cost effective manner; the performance of their overall credit portfolios; their willingness to accept the risks associated with lending to marine dealers; and the overall creditworthiness of those dealers.  The Company's sales could be adversely affected if BAC were to be terminated, if further declines in floorplan financing availability 8occur, or if financing terms change unfavorably.  This could require dealers to find alternative sources of financing, including the Company providing this financing directly to dealers, which could require additional capital to fund the associated receivables.The Company's financial results may be adversely affected if it is unable to maintain effective distribution.The Company relies on third-party dealers and distributors to sell the majority of its products, particularly in the marine business.  The ability to maintain a reliable network of dealers is essential to the Company's success.  The Company faces competition from other boat manufacturers in attracting and retaining distributors and independent boat dealers. A significant deterioration in the number or effectiveness of the Company's dealers and distributors could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial results.Weakening demand for marine products could adversely affect the financial performance of the Company's dealers.  In particular, reduced cash flow from decreases in sales and tightening credit markets may impair a dealer's ability to fund operations.  Inability to fund operations can force dealers to cease business, and the Company may not be able to obtain alternate distribution in the vacated market. An inability to obtain alternate distribution could unfavorably affect the Company's net sales through reduced market presence. If conditions were to worsen, the Company anticipates that dealer failures or voluntary market exits could increase, especially if overall retail demand for boats materially declines. Finally, labor disruption at major ports and shipping hubs around the world may adversely affect the Company and its distributors’ ability to transport raw materials to its facilities and products to its distributors and end-use customers, potentially resulting in increased transportation costs and lost sales.Adverse economic, credit and capital market conditions could have a negative impact on the Company's financial results.The Company does not frequently rely on short-term capital markets to meet its working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, pay dividends, or fund employee benefit programs; however, the Company does maintain short-term borrowing facilities which can be used to meet these capital requirements.  In addition, over the long term, the Company may determine that it is necessary to access the capital markets to refinance existing long-term indebtedness or for other initiatives.Adverse global economic conditions, market volatility and heightened governmental regulation could lead to volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets.  This could adversely affect the Company's ability to access capital and credit markets or increase the cost to do so, which could have a negative impact on its business, financial results and competitive position.Changes in currency exchange rates can adversely affect the Company's results.A portion of the Company's sales are denominated in a currency other than the U.S. dollar.  Consequently, a strong U.S. dollar may adversely affect reported revenues.  The Company also maintains a portion of its cost structure in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which partially mitigates the impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar.  This includes manufacturing operations for boats in Europe, Brazil and Canada, fitness equipment in Europe, as well as smaller outboard engines in Asia.  A portion of SG&A costs are also transacted in a currency other than the U.S. dollar.The Company sells U.S. manufactured products into certain international markets in U.S. dollars, including the sale of products into Canada, Europe and Latin America.  Demand for the Company's products in these markets may also be  adversely affected by a strengthening U.S. dollar.  The Company has certain competitors with cost positions based outside the U.S., including Asian-based outboard engine manufacturers, European-based large fiberglass boat manufacturers and a European-based fitness equipment manufacturer.  A strengthening U.S. dollar may provide a cost advantage to these competitors, which could result in pricing pressures.The Company maintains hedging programs to reduce its risk to currency fluctuations; however, it is not possible to hedge against all currency risk, especially over the long term.  The Company also continues to evaluate its supply chain and cost structure for opportunities to further mitigate risks associated with foreign currency.  Inventory reductions by major dealers, retailers and independent boat builders could adversely affect the Company's financial results.The Company and its dealers, retailers and other distributors could decide to reduce the number of units they hold, particularly if demand trails forecasted levels or if new product introductions are expected to replace older products.  Such efforts tend to result in wholesale reductions in excess of retail reductions and would likely result in lower production levels of the Company's products, thus resulting in lower rates of absorption of fixed costs in the Company's manufacturing facilities and lower margins. While actions taken continue to keep dealer inventories at appropriate levels, the potential need for future inventory reductions by dealers and independent boat builder customers could impair the Company's future sales and results of operations.9The Company may be required to repurchase inventory or accounts of certain dealers.The Company has agreements with certain third-party finance companies to provide financing to the Company's customers to enable the purchase of its products.  In connection with these agreements, the Company either may have obligations to repurchase the Company's products from the finance company, or may have recourse obligations to the finance company on the dealer's receivables.  These obligations are triggered if the Company's dealers default on their debt obligations to the finance companies.The Company's maximum contingent obligation to repurchase inventory and its maximum contingent recourse obligations on customer receivables have been reduced in recent years and are less than the total balances of dealer financings outstanding under these programs, as the Company's obligations under certain of these arrangements are subject to caps, or are limited based on the age of product.  The Company's risk related to these arrangements is mitigated by the proceeds it receives on the resale of repurchased product to other dealers, or by recoveries on receivables purchased under the recourse obligations.The Company's inventory repurchase obligations relate primarily to the inventory floorplan credit facilities of the Company's boat and engine dealers. The Company's actual historical repurchase experience related to these repurchase arrangements has been substantially less than the Company's maximum contractual obligations. If dealers file for bankruptcy or cease operations, losses associated with the repurchase of the Company's products could be incurred.  In addition, as the repurchases may be triggered by dealer bankruptcies, the Company's net sales and earnings may be unfavorably affected as a result of reduced market coverage and the associated decline in sales.Declines in marine industry demand could cause an increase in future repurchase activity, or could require the Company to incur losses in excess of established reserves.  In addition, the Company's cash flow and loss experience could be adversely affected if repurchased inventory is not successfully distributed to other dealers in a timely manner, or if the recovery rate on the resale of the product declines.  In addition, the finance companies could require changes in repurchase or recourse terms that would result in an increase in the Company's contractual contingent obligations.The loss of key customers or critical suppliers could harm the Company's business.If the Company were to experience the loss of a key customer, its business could be negatively affected in a significant way.  Similarly, if one of the Company's most critical suppliers were to close its operations, cease manufacturing or otherwise fail to deliver an essential component necessary to the Company's manufacturing operations, it could have a detrimental effect on the Company's ability to manufacture and sell its products, resulting in an interruption in business operations and/or a loss of sales.  In an effort to mitigate the risk associated with the Company's reliance on such customers and suppliers, it continually works to monitor such relationships, maintain a complete and competitive product lineup and identify alternative suppliers for key components.The Company's success depends upon the continued strength of its brands.The Company believes that its brands, including Brunswick, Mercury, Life Fitness, Sea Ray, Boston Whaler and Lund, are significant contributors to the success of the Company's business, and that maintaining and enhancing the brands are important to expanding the Company's customer base.  Failure to continue to promote and protect the Company's brands may adversely affect the Company's business and results of operations.The Company has a large fixed cost base that can affect its profitability in a declining sales environment.The fixed cost levels of operating marine production plants can put pressure on profit margins when sales and production decline. The Company's profitability is dependent, in part, on its ability to spread fixed costs over an increasing number of products sold and shipped, and if the Company makes a decision to reduce its rate of production, gross margins could be negatively affected. Consequently, decreased demand or the need to reduce inventories can lower the Company's ability to absorb fixed costs and materially impact its results of operations.Successfully managing the expansion of its manufacturing footprint is critical to the Company's operating and financial results.Over the past two years, the Company has made strategic capital investments in capacity expansion activities that will enable the affected businesses to successfully capture growth opportunities and enhance product offerings.  Recently, the Company announced the reactivation of its Sykes Creek manufacturing facility in Merritt Island, Florida, invested capital in a new pontoon facility in Fort Wayne, Indiana and has initiated or completed plant expansion activities at its facilities in Edgewater and Palm Coast Florida, New York Mills, Minnesota, Fond du Lac, Wisconsin and Kiskoros, Hungary.  These capital improvement projects and expansions must be carefully managed to ensure cost targets are met, environmental, safety and other regulations are followed and high-quality workmanship is maintained.10Moving production to a different plant or expanding capacity at an existing facility involves risks, including the inability to start up production within the cost and timeframe estimated, supply product to customers when expected and attract and train a sufficient number of skilled workers to handle the additional production demands.  The inability to successfully implement the Company's manufacturing footprint initiatives could adversely affect its ability to meet customer demand for products and could increase the cost of production versus projections, both of which could result in a significant adverse impact on operating and financial results. Additionally, plants experiencing demand increases may face manufacturing inefficiencies, additional expenses and cost inefficiencies, which could exceed projections and negatively impact financial results.If the Company is not able to successfully implement its strategic plan and growth initiatives, this could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and financial condition.The Company's ability to continue generating positive cash flow and profits will depend partly on its continued successful execution of the Company's strategic plan and growth initiatives.  The Company’s ability to succeed in its strategic plan and growth initiatives may require significant capital investment and management attention, which may result in the diversion of these resources from the core business and other business issues and opportunities.  Additionally, any new initiative is subject to certain risks, including customer acceptance, competition, the ability to manufacture the products on schedule and to specification, create the necessary supply chain and/or the ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to develop and successfully implement its strategic plan and growth initiatives to a point where they will become profitable or generate positive cash flow. If the Company cannot successfully execute its strategic plan and growth initiatives, the Company’s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted.One of the Company’s growth strategies may involve the acquisition of adjacent companies and product lines. There can be no assurance that additional acquisitions will be consummated or that, if consummated, will be successful and the acquired businesses will be successfully integrated into the Company’s operations.  Certain acquisitions or related integration may disrupt operations and pose potential difficulties in employee retention, and there may be additional risks with respect to the Company’s ability to recognize the benefits of acquisitions, including potential synergies and cost savings or the failure of acquisitions to achieve their plans and objectives.The Company relies on third-party suppliers for the supply of the raw materials, parts and components necessary to manufacture its products.  The Company's financial results may be adversely affected by an increase in cost, disruption of supply or shortage of or defect in raw materials, parts or product components.Outside suppliers and contract manufacturers provide the Company with raw materials used in its manufacturing processes including oil, aluminum, copper, steel and resins, as well as product parts and components.  The prices for these raw materials, parts and components fluctuate depending on market conditions and in some instances, commodity prices.  Substantial increases in the prices of the Company's raw materials, parts and components would increase the Company's operating costs, and could reduce its profitability if the Company could not recoup the increased costs through increased product prices.  In addition, some components used in the Company's manufacturing processes, including certain engine components, furniture, upholstery and boat windshields are available from a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers.  Operational and financial difficulties that these or other suppliers may face in the future could adversely affect their ability to supply the Company with the parts and components it needs, which could significantly disrupt the Company's operations.  It may be difficult to find a replacement supplier for a limited or sole source raw material, part or component without significant delay or on commercially reasonable terms.  In addition, an uncorrected defect or supplier's variation in a raw material, part or component, either unknown to the Company or incompatible with the Company's manufacturing process, could harm the Company's ability to manufacture products.  Some of the risks that could disrupt the Company's operations, impair the Company's ability to deliver products to the Company's customers and negatively affect the Company's financial results include: an increase in the cost of, defects in or a sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of some of these raw materials, parts or products that may be caused by delayed start-up periods experienced by the Company's suppliers as they increase production efforts; financial pressures on the Company's suppliers due to a weakening economy; a deterioration of the Company's relationships with suppliers; or by events such as natural disasters, power outages or labor strikes, including the current slowdown and potential strike involving the U.S. west coast ports.  In addition to the risks described above regarding interruption of supplies, which are exacerbated in the case of single-source suppliers, the exclusive supplier of a key component potentially could exert significant bargaining power over price, quality, warranty claims, or other terms relating to a component.The Company's manufacturing operations increased production in 2014 and are expected to continue to do so in 2015, and consequently, the Company's need for raw materials and supplies will increase. The Company's suppliers must be prepared to ramp-up operations and, in many cases, hire additional workers and/or expand capacity in order to fulfill the orders placed by the Company and other customers.  The Company experienced periodic supply shortages in 2014.  The Company continues to work 11to address this issue by identifying alternative suppliers, working to secure adequate inventories of critical supplies and continually monitoring the capabilities of its supplier base. In the future, however, the Company may continue to experience shortages of, delayed delivery of and/or increased prices for key materials, parts and supplies that are essential to its manufacturing operations.The Company's pension funding requirements and expenses are affected by certain factors outside its control, including the performance of plan assets, the discount rate used to value liabilities, actuarial data and experience and legal and regulatory changes.The Company's funding obligations and pension expense for its four U.S. qualified pension plans are driven by the performance of assets set aside in trusts for these plans, the discount rate used to value the plans' liabilities, actuarial data and experience, and legal and regulatory funding requirements.  Changes in these factors could have an adverse impact on the Company's results of operations, liquidity or shareholders' equity.  In addition, a portion of the Company's pension plan assets are invested in equity securities, which can experience significant declines if economic conditions or financial markets weaken.  The level of the Company's funding of its qualified pension plan liabilities was approximately 76 percent as of December 31, 2014. The Company's future pension expenses and funding requirements could increase significantly due to the effect of adverse changes in the discount rate and asset levels along with a decline in the estimated return on plan assets. In addition, as a result of changes in regulations, the Company could be legally required to make increased contributions to the pension plans, and these contributions could be material and negatively affect the Company's cash flow.The Company is currently mitigating these risks by transitioning the asset allocation in the pensions to 100 percent fixed income and through the offering of lump sum settlements to certain plan participants.The timing and amount of the Company’s share repurchases are subject to a number of uncertainties.During the fourth quarter of 2014, the Company announced its board of directors had authorized the discretionary repurchase of up to $200 million of the Company's outstanding common stock, which will be systematically completed in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions over approximately a two-year period.  The amount and timing of share repurchases will be based on a variety of factors. Important factors that could cause us to limit, suspend or delay the Company's stock repurchases include unfavorable market conditions, the trading price of the Company's common stock, the nature of other investment opportunities available to us from time to time and the availability of cash. If we delay, limit or suspend the Company's stock repurchase program, the Company's stock price and earnings per share may be negatively affected.Higher energy and fuel costs can affect the Company's results.Higher energy and fuel costs result in increases in operating expenses at the Company's manufacturing facilities and in the cost of shipping products to customers.  In addition, increases in energy costs can adversely affect the pricing and availability of petroleum-based raw materials such as resins and foam that are used in many of the Company's marine products.  Also, higher fuel prices may have an adverse effect on demand for marine retail products, as they increase the cost of boat ownership and possibly affect product usage, and may have a negative impact on operating margins, particularly in the Fitness segment, as transportation costs increase.The Company's profitability may suffer as a result of competitive pricing and other pressures.The introduction of lower-priced alternative products by other companies can hurt the Company's competitive position in all of its businesses.  The Company is constantly subject to competitive pressures in which predominantly international manufacturers may pursue a strategy of aggressive pricing, particularly during periods when local currency weakens versus the U.S. dollar.  Such pricing pressure may limit the Company's ability to increase prices for its products in response to raw material and other cost increases and negatively affect the Company's profit margins.In addition, international boat builders continue to enter the U.S. market, mainly in the large fiberglass boat segment, thereby adding additional product options into a market where the Company has historically been a market leader.  These new entrants, combined with continued sluggish market conditions in certain segments, may prevent the Company from successfully implementing its strategic plan and could result in lower sales.Finally, the Company's independent boat builder customers may react negatively to potential competition for their products from Brunswick's own boat brands, which can lead them to purchase marine engines and marine engine supplies from competing marine engine manufacturers and may negatively affect demand for the Company's products.12The Company's ability to remain competitive depends on the successful introduction of new product offerings and the ability to meet its customers' expectations.The Company believes that its customers rigorously evaluate their suppliers on the basis of product quality along with new product innovation and development capability. The Company's ability to remain competitive and meet its growth objectives may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development, such as an inability to develop viable new products, gain market acceptance of new products, generate sufficient capital to fund new product development or obtain adequate intellectual property protection for new products. To meet ever-changing consumer demands, the timing of market entry and pricing of new products are critical.  As a result, the Company may not be able to introduce new products necessary to remain competitive in all markets that it serves.  Furthermore, the Company must deliver quality products that meet or exceed its customers' expectations regarding product quality and after-sales service.The Company competes with a variety of other activities for consumers' scarce discretionary income and leisure time.The vast majority of the Company's products are used for recreational purposes, and demand for the Company's products can be adversely affected by competition from other activities that occupy consumers' time, including other forms of recreation as well as religious, cultural and community activities. Additionally, any pressures or slow growth in consumers' discretionary income may influence consumers' willingness to purchase and enjoy the Company's products.The Company manufactures and sells products that create exposure to potential product liability, warranty liability, personal injury and property damage claims and litigation.The Company's products may expose it to potential product liability, warranty liability, personal injury or property damage claims relating to the use of those products. The Company's manufacturing footprint actions and production of new products could result in product quality issues, thereby increasing the risk of litigation and potential liability. To address this risk, the Company has established a global, enterprise-wide organization charged with the responsibility of addressing, reviewing and reporting on product integrity issues.  Historically, the resolution of such claims has not materially adversely affected the Company's business, and the Company maintains insurance coverage to mitigate a portion of these risks, which it believes to be adequate.  However, the Company may experience material losses in the future, incur significant costs to defend claims or experience claims in excess of its insurance coverage or claims that will not be covered by insurance.  Furthermore, the Company's reputation may be adversely affected by such claims, whether or not successful, including potential negative publicity about its products. The Company records reserves for known potential liabilities, but there is the possibility that actual losses may exceed these reserves and therefore negatively impact earnings.Environmental laws and zoning and other requirements can inhibit the Company's ability to grow its marine businesses.Environmental restrictions, boat plant emission restrictions and permitting and zoning requirements can limit production capacity, access to water for boating, as well as marina and storage space.  In addition, certain jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States require or are considering requiring a license to operate a recreational boat.  While such licensing requirements are not expected to be unduly restrictive, they may deter potential customers, thereby reducing the Company's sales.  Furthermore, regulations allowing the sale of fuel containing higher levels of ethanol for automobiles, which is not appropriate or intended for use in marine engines, may nonetheless result in increased warranty, service costs, product dissatisfaction and other claims against the Company if boaters mistakenly use this fuel in marine engines, causing damage to and the degradation of components in their marine engines.Compliance with environmental regulations affecting marine engines will increase costs and may reduce demand for the Company's products.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's emission regulations require certain gasoline sterndrive and inboard engines to be equipped with a catalyst exhaust monitoring and treatment system.  It is possible that environmental regulatory bodies may impose higher emissions standards in the future for these and other marine engines including outboards.  Compliance with these standards would increase the cost to manufacture and the price to the customer for the Company's engines, which could in turn reduce consumer demand for the Company's marine products and potentially reduce operating margins. An increase in the cost of marine engines, an increase in the retail price to consumers, or unforeseen delays in compliance with environmental regulations affecting these products, could have an adverse effect on the Company's results of operations.13The Company's businesses may be adversely affected by compliance obligations and liabilities under various laws and regulations.The Company is subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including product safety, environmental, health and safety laws and other regulations.  While the Company believes that it maintains all requisite licenses and permits and that it is in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, a failure to satisfy these and other regulatory requirements could cause the Company to incur fines or penalties, and compliance could increase its cost of operations.  The adoption of additional laws, rules and regulations could also increase the Company's capital or operating costs.The Company's manufacturing processes involve the use, handling, storage and contracting for recycling or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes.  Accordingly, the Company is subject to regulations regarding these substances, and the misuse or mishandling of such substances could expose it to liabilities, including claims for property or natural resources damages or personal injury, or fines.  The Company is also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property.  If a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from any of the Company's current or former properties or another location where it has disposed of hazardous materials, the Company may be held liable for the contamination, regardless of knowledge or whether it was at fault in connection with the release, and the amount of such liability could be material.Additionally, the Company is subject to laws governing its relationship with its employees, including, but not limited to, employee wage, hour and benefit issues, such as pension funding and health care benefits.  Changes to such legislation could increase the cost of the Company's operations. Increases in income tax rates or changes in income tax laws or enforcement could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial results.Changes in domestic and international tax legislation could expose the Company to additional tax liability or possibly require changes to lower deferred tax asset values.  Although the Company carefully monitors changes in tax laws and works to mitigate the impact of proposed changes, such changes or failure to extend legislation, including the research and development credit, may negatively impact the Company's financial results.  In addition, any increase in individual income tax rates would negatively affect the Company's potential customers' discretionary income and could decrease the demand for its products.  Finally, governments in many jurisdictions are increasing their audit activity and are engaging in other projects, such as those related to alleged base erosion and profit shifting, in an effort to obtain additional revenue.  This increase in activity involves increased costs to the Company for having to resolve these potential disputes and from the potential additional taxes which may be assessed.If the Company's intellectual property protection is inadequate, others may be able to use its technologies and thereby impair the Company's ability to compete, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company, its financial condition and results of operations.The Company regards much of the technology underlying its products as proprietary.  The Company relies on a combination of patents, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws; employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements; and other contracts to establish and protect its technology and other intellectual property rights.  The steps the Company takes to protect its proprietary technology may be inadequate to prevent misappropriation of the Company's technology, or third parties may independently develop similar technology.  Agreements containing protections may be breached or terminated, the Company may not have adequate remedies for any such breach, and existing patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws may afford it limited protection.  Policing unauthorized use of the Company's intellectual property is difficult, particularly in many regions outside the United States.  A third party could copy or otherwise obtain and use the Company's products or technology without authorization. Litigation may be necessary for the Company to defend against claims of infringement or to protect its intellectual property rights and could result in substantial cost and divert the attention of management.  Further, the Company might not prevail in such litigation and the Company may be forced to seek licenses or royalty arrangements from third parties, which the Company may not be able to obtain on reasonable terms, or the Company may be forced to stop using products that included the challenged intellectual property, which could harm its business.Some of the Company's operations are conducted by joint ventures that are not operated solely for its benefit.Some of the Company's operations are carried on through jointly owned companies such as BAC, Bella and Tohatsu Marine Corporation.  With respect to these joint ventures, the Company shares ownership and management responsibility of these companies with one or more parties who may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities or resources as the Company.  These joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of all co-owners, rather than for the Company's exclusive benefit. 14A significant portion of the Company's revenue is derived from international sources, which exposes it to additional uncertainty.The Company intends to continue to expand its international operations and customer base as part of its growth strategy.  Sales outside the United States, especially in emerging markets, are subject to various risks, including government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions, foreign currency effects, tariffs, customs duties, inflation, difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems, compliance with international laws, treaties and regulations and unexpected changes in regulatory environments, disruptions in distribution, dependence on foreign personnel and unions, as well as economic and social instability.  In addition, there may be tax inefficiencies in repatriating cash from non-U.S. subsidiaries.  If the Company continues to expand its business globally, its success will depend, in part, on the Company's ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks.  These and other factors may have a material impact on the Company's international operations or its business as a whole.An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill, trade names and other long-lived assets could negatively affect the Company's consolidated results of operations and net worth.Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as the Company's trade names, are recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition and are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise.  In evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill and trade names, the Company makes assumptions regarding future operating performance, business trends and market and economic conditions.  Such analyses further require the Company to make certain assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates.  There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and in applying these factors to the assessment of goodwill and trade name recoverability.  Goodwill reviews are prepared using estimates of the fair value of reporting units based on the estimated present value of future discounted cash flows.  The Company could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill or trade names prior to the annual assessment if it experiences disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, a divestiture of a significant component of the Company's business or market capitalization declines.The Company also continually evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of its definite-lived intangible assets, excluding goodwill, and other long-lived assets may warrant revision or whether the remaining balance of such assets may not be recoverable.  The Company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flow over the remaining life of the asset in measuring whether the asset is recoverable.If the future operating performance of the Company's reporting units is not sufficient, the Company could be required to record non-cash impairment charges.  Impairment charges could substantially affect the Company's reported earnings in the periods such charges are recorded.  In addition, impairment charges could indicate a reduction in business value which could limit the Company's ability to obtain adequate financing in the future.  As of December 31, 2014, goodwill was approximately 9 percent of total assets and included $268.9 million of goodwill related to the Life Fitness segment and $28.0 million of goodwill related to the Marine Engine segment.Adverse weather conditions can have a negative effect on marine revenues.Weather conditions can have a significant effect on the Company's operating and financial results, especially in the marine businesses.  Sales of the Company's marine products are generally stronger just before and during spring and summer, and favorable weather during these months generally has had a positive effect on consumer demand.  Conversely, unseasonably cool weather, excessive rainfall or drought conditions during these periods can reduce demand.  Hurricanes and other storms can result in the disruption of the Company's distribution channel, operations or supply chain.  Additionally, in the event that climate change occurs, which could result in environmental changes including, but not limited to, severe weather, rising sea levels or reduced access to water, the Company's business could be disrupted and negatively affected.Instability in locations where the Company maintains a significant presence could adversely impact the Company's business operations.The Company has established a global presence, with manufacturing, sales, distribution and retail locations around the world.  Changing conditions in those locations, including, but not limited to, political instability, civil unrest and an increase in criminal activity, could have a negative impact on the Company's local manufacturing and other business operations.  Decreased stability in those regions where the Company conducts business poses a risk of business interruption and delays in shipments of materials, components and finished goods, as well as a risk of decreased local retail demand for the Company's products in those regions.15Catastrophic events, including natural and environmental disasters, could have a negative effect on the Company's operations and financial results.The occurrence of natural and environmental disasters, including hurricanes, floods, earthquakes and environmental spills, could decrease consumer demand for and sales of the Company's products.  If such an occurrence takes place in one of Brunswick's major sales markets, the Company could experience a decrease in sales.  Additionally, if such an event occurs near the Company's business, manufacturing facilities or key suppliers' facilities, the affected locations could experience an interruption in business operations and/or their operating systems.  The Company could be uniquely affected by a catastrophic event due to the location of certain of the Company's boat facilities in coastal Florida and the size of the manufacturing operation in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin.The Company's operations are dependent upon the ability of the Company to attract and retain individuals who could be key contributors.The Company's operations depend, in part, on the efforts of the Company's executive officers and other key employees.  In addition, the Company's future success will depend on, among other factors, its ability to attract and retain other qualified personnel. The loss of the services of any of the Company's key employees or the failure to attract or retain employees could have an adverse effect on the Company.  If the Company is unable to attract and retain qualified individuals, or the Company's costs to do so increase significantly, the Company's operations could be adversely affected.The Company's business operations could be negatively impacted by the failure of its information technology systems.The Company's global business operations are managed through a variety of information technology (IT) systems.  These systems govern all aspects of the company's operations around the world.  The Company is dependent on these systems for all commercial transactions, customer interactions, and image projection.  Some of the systems are based on legacy technology and operate with a minimal level of available support.  If one of these legacy systems or another of the Company's key IT systems were to suffer a failure, or if the Company's IT systems were unable to communicate effectively, this could result in missed or delayed sales, or lost opportunities for cost reduction or efficient cash management.  The Company exchanges information with hundreds of trading partners across all aspects of its commercial operations.  Any breach in security or disruption of the communications could result in erroneous transactions or loss of reputation and confidence.  The Company has numerous portals to engage in e-commerce and e-marketing; therefore, the Company must remain diligent in protecting itself and its customers from malicious cyber attacks.  A successful cyber attack could result in a disruption of services, fraudulent transactions, or disclosure of confidential information.  This could negatively affect the Company's relationships with its customers and trading partners and damage its image and reputation"

The Company believes its Marine Engine segment has the largest dollar sales and unit volume of recreational marine engines in the world, along with a leading marine parts and accessories business. Mercury Marine manufactures and markets a full range of outboard engines, sterndrive propulsion systems and inboard engines under the Mercury, Mercury MerCruiser, Mariner, Mercury Racing, Mercury Sport Jet and Mercury Jet Drive, MotorGuide, Axius and Zeus brand names. In addition, Mercury Marine manufactures and markets marine parts and accessories under the Quicksilver, Mercury Precision Parts, Mercury Propellers, Attwood, Land 'N' Sea, Kellogg Marine Supply, Diversified Marine Products, Sea Choice and MotorGuide brand names, including marine electronics and control integration systems, steering systems, instruments, controls, propellers, trolling motors, fuel systems, service parts and marine lubricants. Mercury Marine's outboard engines, sterndrive engines and inboard engines are sold to independent boat builders, local, state and foreign governments, and to the Company's Boat segment. In addition, Mercury Marine's outboard engines are sold to end-users through a global network of more than 6,000 marine dealers and distributors, specialty marine retailers and marine service centers. Mercury Marine also supplies integrated, high-speed diesel propulsion systems to the worldwide recreational and commercial marine markets, including the Company's Boat segment.  During the second quarter of 2012, the Company and Cummins Inc. transitioned to the respective parent companies the business activities of Cummins MerCruiser Diesel Marine LLC (CMD), the joint venture between Mercury Marine and Cummins Marine, a division of Cummins Inc., and began the liquidation process of the joint venture.  This liquidation process was completed in 2013.  As part of the transition, Mercury Marine has integrated CMD's high-speed diesel engine line into its product portfolio and sells, services and supports these products through its global sales and distribution network. Mercury Marine manufactures four-stroke outboard engine models ranging from 2.5 to 350 horsepower and two-stroke OptiMax outboard engines, all of which feature Mercury's direct fuel injection (DFI) technology, ranging from 75 to 300 horsepower.  All of these low-emission engines are in compliance with current U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requirements.  Mercury Marine's four-stroke outboard engines include Verado, a collection of supercharged outboards ranging from 150 to 350 horsepower, 1and Mercury Marine's naturally aspirated four-stroke outboards, ranging from 2.5 to 150 horsepower, including the 150 FourStroke, introduced in 2012, which quickly became known for its light weight, fuel efficiency and performance. Mercury Marine also manufactures two-stroke, non-DFI engines for certain markets outside the United States.  In addition, most of Mercury's sterndrive and inboard engines are now available with catalyst exhaust monitoring and treatment systems, and all are compliant with environmental regulations adopted by the State of California, effective January 1, 2008, and by the EPA, effective January 1, 2010. To promote advanced propulsion systems with improved handling, performance and efficiency, Mercury Marine manufactures and markets advanced boat steering and engine control systems under the brand names of Zeus and Axius. Mercury Marine's gasoline sterndrive and outboard engines are produced domestically in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, with outboard engines also produced internationally in China and Japan.

Mercury Marine sources certain engine components from a global supply base of Asian, European and Latin American suppliers and manufactures additional engine component parts at its Fond du Lac facility and plants in Florida and Mexico.  Mercury Marine also operates a remanufacturing business for engines and service parts in Wisconsin.  In addition, Mercury Marine has an equity ownership interest in a company that manufactures boats under the brand names Bella, Flipper and Aquador in Finland.    Mercury Marine's parts and accessories distribution and products businesses include: Land 'N' Sea, Kellogg Marine Supply, Diversified Marine Products and Attwood Marine. These businesses are the leading distributors of marine parts and accessories throughout North America, offering same-day or next-day delivery service to a broad array of marine service facilities. Inter-company sales to the Company's Boat segment represented approximately 11 percent of Mercury Marine's sales in 2013.  Domestic demand for the Marine Engine segment's products is seasonal, with sales generally highest in the second calendar quarter of the year. Boat SegmentThe Boat segment consists of the Brunswick Boat Group (Boat Group), which manufactures and markets the following products: fiberglass pleasure boats; yachts and sport yachts; offshore fishing boats; aluminum fishing boats; pontoon boats; deck boats and inflatable boats.  The Company believes that its Boat Group, which had net sales of $1,032.0 million during 2013, has the largest dollar sales and unit volume of any pleasure motorboat manufacturer in the world. The Boat Group manages Brunswick's boat brands; evaluates and optimizes the Boat segment's boat portfolio; promotes recreational boating services and activities to enhance the consumer experience and dealer profitability; and speeds the introduction of new technologies into the boat manufacturing and design processes. The Boat Group includes the following boat brands: Sea Ray yachts, sport yachts, sport cruisers and runabouts; Bayliner sport cruisers and runabouts; Meridian yachts; Boston Whaler and Lund fiberglass fishing boats; and Crestliner, Cypress Cay, Harris FloteBote, Lowe, Lund and Princecraft aluminum fishing, utility, pontoon boats and deck boats. The Boat Group also includes a commercial and governmental sales unit that sells products to commercial customers, as well as to the United States government and state, local and foreign governments. The Boat Group procures most of its outboard engines, gasoline sterndrive engines and gasoline inboard engines from Brunswick's Marine Engine segment.The Boat Group also includes several Brunswick boat brands based in Europe and Asia, which include Quicksilver, Uttern and Rayglass (Protector and Legend), which are typically equipped with engines manufactured by Mercury Marine and often include other parts and accessories supplied by Mercury Marine. The Boat Group has active manufacturing facilities in Florida, Indiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Tennessee, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand and Portugal, as well as additional inactive manufacturing facilities in Indiana, North Carolina and Tennessee.  The Boat Group utilizes contract manufacturing facilities in Poland.During 2013, the Boat Group continued its restructuring activities by reducing its workforce and consolidating manufacturing operations.  In the fourth quarter of 2013, the Company made the decision to outsource woodworking operations for its fiberglass sterndrive boats, which resulted in long-lived asset impairment charges.  Throughout the first half of 2013, the Company completed the consolidation of its Knoxville, Tennessee boat plant operation into its manufacturing facilities in Vonore, Tennessee and Palm Coast, Florida.  In the first quarter of 2013, the Company announced the consolidation of its yacht and motoryacht production at its Palm Coast, Florida manufacturing plant, and as a result, the Company suspended manufacturing at its Sykes Creek boat manufacturing facility in nearby Merritt Island, Florida as of the end of June 2013.  In August 2013, the Company completed the 2sale of its Hatteras and Cabo boat businesses.  Finally, in 2013, the Boat Group divested several idle operating facilities and other real property holdings in Merritt Island, Florida; Ashland City, Knoxville and Dandridge, Tennessee; and Swansboro, North Carolina. The Boat Group's products are sold to end-users through a global network of approximately 2,950 dealers and distributors, each of which carries one or more of Brunswick's boat brands. Sales to the Boat Group's largest dealer, MarineMax Inc., which has multiple locations and carries a number of the Boat Group's product lines, represented approximately 17 percent of Boat Group sales in 2013. Domestic demand for pleasure boats is seasonal, with sales generally highest in the second calendar quarter of the year.Fitness SegmentBrunswick's Fitness segment is comprised of its Life Fitness division (Life Fitness), which designs, manufactures and markets a full line of reliable, high-quality cardiovascular fitness equipment (including treadmills, total body cross-trainers, stair climbers and stationary exercise bicycles) and strength-training equipment under the Life Fitness and Hammer Strength brands. The Company believes that its Fitness segment, which had net sales of $693.5 million during 2013, is the world's largest manufacturer of commercial fitness equipment and a leading manufacturer of high-quality consumer fitness equipment. Life Fitness' commercial sales customers include health clubs, corporations, schools and universities, hotels, professional sports teams and the military and governmental agencies.  Commercial sales are made to customers through Life Fitness' direct sales force, domestic dealers, and international distributors.  Consumer products are available at specialty retailers, select mass merchants, sporting goods stores, through international distributors, and on the Life Fitness Web site. The Fitness segment's principal manufacturing facilities are located in Illinois, Kentucky, Minnesota and Hungary, with third party contract manufacturing partners in China and Taiwan.  Life Fitness distributes its products worldwide from regional warehouses and production facilities. Demand for Life Fitness products is seasonal, with sales generally highest in the fourth quarter of the year.Bowling & Billiards SegmentThe Bowling & Billiards segment is comprised of the Brunswick Bowling & Billiards division (BB&B), which had net sales of $310.3 million during 2013. The Company believes BB&B is a leading worldwide full-line designer, manufacturer and marketer of bowling and billiards products and operator of retail bowling centers. BB&B's bowling products business designs, manufactures and markets a wide variety of bowling products, including capital equipment (such as automatic pinsetters and scoring devices), bowling balls and aftermarket products (such as lane machines, pinsetter parts, lane conditioners and lane cleaners). Through licensing arrangements, BB&B also offers a wide array of bowling consumer products, including bowling shoes, bags and accessories. BB&B operates 88 bowling centers in the United States and Canada.  During 2013, BB&B divested its seven European bowling centers.  BB&B retail bowling centers offer bowling and, depending on size and location, may also offer the following activities and facilities: in-house restaurants, taverns, outdoor patios, billiards, video and redemption games, laser tag, pro shops and meeting and party rooms.  Of the Company's 88 bowling centers, 37 have been converted into Brunswick Zones, bowling centers that offer an array of active entertainment activities for our guests. BB&B has further enhanced the Brunswick Zone concept with expanded Brunswick Zone entertainment centers, branded Brunswick Zone XL, which are larger than typical Brunswick Zones and feature multiple entertainment offerings.  BB&B operates 15 Brunswick Zone XL centers.In 2013, BB&B introduced three new ""Brunswick's"" bowling centers, designed to create a unique combination of active entertainment and distinctive cuisine that provides guests with a superior experience.  The new Brunswick's centers are complemented by elevated American pub fare from in-house restaurant Tavern '45, local and craft beers and superior service. The lively atmosphere encourages guests to connect with friends in an active, welcoming environment. BB&B's billiards business was established in 1845 and is Brunswick's heritage business.  BB&B designs and/or markets billiards tables, table tennis tables, air powered table hockey games, billiard balls, cues and other gaming tables, as well as game room furniture and related accessories, under the Brunswick and Contender brands. BB&B's primary manufacturing and distribution facilities are located in Michigan, Wisconsin, Hungary and Mexico. 3Brunswick's bowling and billiards products are sold through a variety of channels, including distributors, dealers, mass merchandisers, bowling centers and other retailers, and directly to consumers through the Internet and other outlets. BB&B's sales are seasonal with sales generally highest in the first and fourth calendar quarters of the year.Discontinued OperationsOn December 31, 2012, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to exit its Hatteras and Cabo boat businesses, with the sale of these businesses completed in August 2013.  As a result, these businesses, which were previously reported in the Company's Boat segment, are being reported as discontinued operations and are reported in separate lines in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented. The assets and liabilities of these businesses meet the held for sale accounting criteria and have been aggregated and reported on separate lines of the Consolidated Balance Sheets for all periods presented.  Brunswick's results as discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K reflect continuing operations only, unless otherwise noted.  Financial ServicesThe Company, through its Brunswick Financial Services Corporation (BFS) subsidiary, owns a 49 percent interest in a joint venture, Brunswick Acceptance Company, LLC (BAC). CDF Ventures, LLC (CDFV), a subsidiary of GE Capital Corporation, owns the remaining 51 percent. Under the terms of the joint venture agreement, BAC provides secured wholesale inventory floorplan financing to the Company's engine and boat dealers.  In 2013, the term of the BAC joint venture was extended through December 31, 2016. The joint venture agreement contains provisions allowing for the renewal of the agreement or purchase of the other party's interest in the joint venture at the end of its term. Alternatively, either partner may terminate the agreement at the end of its term. Additionally, Brunswick offers financial services through Brunswick Product Protection Corporation, which provides marine dealers the opportunity to offer extended product warranties to retail customers, and through Blue Water Dealer Services, Inc., which provides retail financial services to marine dealers. Each company allows Brunswick to offer a more complete line of financial services to its boat and marine engine dealers and their customers. Refer to Note 9 – Financial Services in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about the Company's financial services. DistributionBrunswick utilizes distributors, dealers and retailers (Dealers) for the majority of its boat sales and significant portions of its sales of marine engine, fitness and bowling and billiards products. Brunswick has over 16,000 Dealers serving its business segments worldwide. Brunswick's marine Dealers typically carry one or more of the following product categories - boats, engines and related parts and accessories. Brunswick owns Land 'N' Sea, Kellogg Marine Supply and Diversified Marine Products, the primary parts and accessories distribution platforms for the Company's Marine Engine segment. We believe that these businesses, collectively, are the leading distributors of marine parts and accessories throughout North America, with 14 distribution warehouses located throughout the United States and Canada offering same-day or next-day delivery service to a broad array of marine service facilities and Dealers. Brunswick's Dealers are independent companies or proprietors that range in size from small, family-owned businesses to a large, publicly-traded corporation with substantial revenues and multiple locations. Some Dealers sell Brunswick's products exclusively, while others also carry competitors' products. Brunswick partners with its boat dealer network to improve quality, service, distribution and delivery of parts and accessories to enhance the boating customer's experience. Demand for a significant portion of Brunswick's products is seasonal, and a number of Brunswick's Dealers are relatively small and/or highly-leveraged. As a result, many Dealers require financial assistance to support their businesses, enabling them to provide stable channels for Brunswick's products. In addition to the financing offered by BAC, the Company provides its Dealers with assistance, including incentive programs, loans, loan guarantees and inventory repurchase commitments, under which the Company is obligated to repurchase inventory from a finance company in the event of a Dealer's default. The Company believes that these arrangements are in its best interest; however, the financial support that the Company provides to its Dealers exposes the Company to credit and business risk. Brunswick's business units, along with BAC, maintain active credit operations to manage this financial exposure, and the Company continually seeks opportunities to sustain and improve the financial health of its various 4distribution channel partners. Refer to Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these arrangements.International OperationsBrunswick's sales to customers in markets other than the United States were $1,429.9 million (37 percent of net sales), $1,397.2 million (38 percent of net sales) and $1,483.6 million (40 percent of net sales) in 2013,  2012 and 2011, respectively. The Company transacts a portion of its sales in non-U.S. markets in local currencies, and the cost of its products is generally denominated in U.S. dollars. As a result, the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar affects the financial results of Brunswick's non-U.S. operations. Non-U.S. sales are set forth in Note 5 – Segment Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and are also included in the table below, which details Brunswick's non-U.S. sales by region:(in millions)2013 2012 2011Europe$499.3 $477.4 $596.3Canada322.4 318.3 301.7Pacific Rim292.7 307.7 289.7Latin America225.7 205.5 191.6Africa & Middle East89.8 88.3 104.3Total$1,429.9 $1,397.2 $1,483.6Marine Engine segment non-U.S. sales represented approximately 46 percent of Brunswick's non-U.S. sales in 2013. The segment's principal non-U.S. operations include the following:•    An outboard engine assembly plant in Suzhou, China;•    An outboard engine assembly plant operated by a joint venture in Japan;•A component manufacturing facility in Mexico;•Distribution, sales, service and applications engineering offices in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand and Singapore; and•    Sales or representative offices in China, Dubai, Finland, France, Italy, Norway, Russia, Sweden and Switzerland.Boat segment non-U.S. sales comprised approximately 26 percent of Brunswick's non-U.S. sales in 2013.  A portion of the Boat Group's products are manufactured or assembled in Brazil, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand and Portugal, as well as in boat plants owned and operated by third parties in Poland that perform contract manufacturing for the Company, and are sold worldwide through Dealers. The Boat Group has sales or import offices in Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland and Sweden.Fitness segment non-U.S. sales comprised approximately 24 percent of Brunswick's non-U.S. sales in 2013. Life Fitness sells its products worldwide and has sales and distribution centers in Brazil, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom. The Fitness segment manufactures strength-training equipment and select lines of cardiovascular equipment in Hungary for its international markets, and has relationships with contract manufacturers in China and Taiwan. Bowling & Billiards segment non-U.S. sales comprised approximately 4 percent of Brunswick's non-U.S. sales in 2013. BB&B sells its products worldwide, has finance and service representatives in Germany, and operates plants that manufacture automatic pinsetters in Hungary and bowling balls in Mexico. BB&B operates three retail bowling centers in Canada.Raw Materials and SuppliesBrunswick purchases a wide variety of raw materials from its supplier base, including oil, aluminum, steel and resins, as well as product parts and components, such as engine blocks and boat windshields. The prices for these raw materials, parts and components fluctuate depending on market conditions. Significant increases in the cost of such materials would raise the Company's production costs, which could reduce the Company's profitability if the Company could not recoup the increased costs through higher product prices. As Brunswick's manufacturing operations raised production levels in 2013, the Company's need for raw materials and supplies increased. Moving into 2014, Brunswick's suppliers will need to increase their manufacturing operations to meet the rising demand 5for their products and, in many cases, may need to hire additional workers in order to fulfill the orders placed by Brunswick and other customers. During 2013, the Company experienced some shortages, and delayed delivery, of certain materials, parts and supplies essential to its manufacturing operations. The Company has addressed and will continue to address this issue by identifying alternative suppliers, working to secure adequate inventories of critical supplies and continually monitoring the capabilities of its supplier base. The Company also continues to expand its global procurement operations to better leverage its purchasing power across its divisions and to improve supply chain and cost efficiencies. The Company mitigates its commodity price risk on certain raw material purchases by using derivatives to hedge exposure related to changes in commodity prices. Intellectual PropertyBrunswick has, and continues to obtain, patent rights covering certain features of its products and processes. By law, Brunswick's patent rights, which consist of patents and patent licenses, have limited lives and expire periodically. The Company believes that its patent rights are important to its competitive position in all of its business segments. In the Marine Engine segment, patent rights principally relate to features of outboard engines and inboard-outboard drives, hybrid drives and pod drives, including: die-cast powerheads; cooling and exhaust systems; drivetrain, clutch and gearshift mechanisms; boat/engine mountings; shock-absorbing tilt mechanisms; ignition systems; propellers; marine vessel control systems; fuel and oil injection systems; supercharged engines; outboard mid-section structures; segmented cowls; hydraulic trim, tilt and steering; screw compressor charge air cooling systems; a range of proprietary metal alloys and airflow silencers. In the Boat segment, patent rights principally relate to processes for manufacturing fiberglass hulls, decks and components for boat products, as well as patent rights related to interiors and other boat features and components. In the Fitness segment, patent rights principally relate to fitness equipment designs and components, including patents covering internal processes, programming functions, displays, design features and styling. In the Bowling & Billiards segment, patent rights principally relate to computerized bowling scorers and bowling center management systems, bowling center furniture, bowling lanes, lane conditioning machines, pinsetters and bowling center equipment, bowling balls, and billiards table designs and components. The following are Brunswick's principal trademarks: Marine Engine Segment:  Attwood, Axius, Diversified Marine Products, Kellogg Marine Supply, Land 'N' Sea, Mariner, MercNET, MerCruiser, Mercury, Mercury Marine, Mercury Parts Express, Mercury Precision Parts, Mercury Propellers, Mercury Racing, MotorGuide, OptiMax, Quicksilver, Seachoice, SeaPro, SmartCraft, Sport Jet, Swivl-Eze, Valiant, Verado and Zeus.Boat Segment:  Aquapalooza, Bayliner, Boston Whaler, Crestliner, Cypress Cay, FloteBote, Harris, Lowe, Lund, Master Dealer, Meridian, Princecraft, Quicksilver, Rayglass, Sea Ray, Sentry and Uttern.Fitness Segment:  Flex Deck, Hammer Strength, Lifecycle and Life Fitness.Bowling & Billiards Segment:  Air Hockey, Brunswick, Brunswick's, Brunswick Zone, Brunswick Zone XL, Centennial, Contender, Cosmic Bowling, DV8, Gold Crown, GS-X, Pro Lane, Striking Line, Tavern '45, Vector, Viz-A-Ball and Zone.Brunswick's trademark rights have indefinite lives, and many are well known to the public and are considered to be valuable assets.Competitive Conditions and PositionThe Company believes that it has a reputation for quality in each of its highly competitive lines of business. Brunswick competes in its various markets by: utilizing efficient production techniques; developing and strengthening its leading brands; developing and promoting innovative technological advancements; undertaking effective marketing, advertising and sales efforts; providing high-quality, innovative products at competitive prices; and offering extensive aftermarket services. Strong competition exists in each of Brunswick's product groups, but no single enterprise competes with Brunswick in all product groups. In each product area, competitors range in size from large, highly-diversified companies to small, single-product businesses. Brunswick also indirectly competes with businesses that offer alternative leisure products or activities.6 The following summarizes Brunswick's competitive position in each segment: Marine Engine Segment:  The Company believes it has the largest dollar sales and unit volume of recreational marine engines in the world, along with a leading marine parts and accessories business. The marine engine market is highly competitive among several major international companies that comprise the majority of the market, as well as several smaller companies including Chinese manufacturers. Competitive advantage in this segment is a function of product features, technological leadership, quality, service, pricing, performance and durability, along with effective promotion and distribution. Boat Segment:  The Company believes it has the largest dollar sales and unit volume of pleasure motorboats in the world. There are several major manufacturers of pleasure and offshore fishing boats, along with hundreds of smaller manufacturers. Consequently, this business is both highly competitive and highly fragmented. The Company believes it has the broadest range of boat product offerings in the world, with boats ranging in size from 10 to 65 feet. In all of its boat operations, Brunswick competes on the basis of product features, technology, quality, brand strength, dealer service, pricing, performance, value, durability and styling, along with effective promotion and distribution. Fitness Segment:  The Company believes it is the world's largest manufacturer of commercial fitness equipment and a leading manufacturer of high-quality consumer fitness equipment. There are a few large manufacturers of fitness equipment and hundreds of small manufacturers, which creates a highly fragmented, competitive landscape. Many of Brunswick's fitness equipment offerings feature industry-leading product innovations, and the Company places significant emphasis on introducing new fitness equipment to the market. Competitive focus is also placed on product quality, technology, service, pricing, state-of-the-art biomechanics, and effective promotional activities. Bowling & Billiards Segment:  The Company believes it is a leading worldwide full-line designer, manufacturer and marketer of bowling products and billiards tables. There are other manufacturers of bowling products and competitive emphasis is placed on product innovation, quality, service, marketing activities and pricing. The billiards industry continues to experience competitive pressure from low-cost billiards manufacturers outside the United States. The bowling retail market, in which the Company's bowling centers compete, is highly fragmented. Brunswick is one of the two largest bowling center operators in the North American market, with Brunswick's bowling retail business emphasizing the bowling and entertainment experience, maintaining quality facilities and providing excellent guest service.  Research and DevelopmentThe Company strives to improve its competitive position in all of its segments by continuously investing in research and development to drive innovation in its products and manufacturing technologies. Brunswick's research and development investments support the introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products. Research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were 3.1 percent, 2.8 percent and 2.6 percent in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.  Research and development expenses by segment are shown below:            (in millions)2013 2012 2011Marine Engine$70.6 $61.5 $56.7Boat22.4 20.2 17.5Fitness21.7 19.2 17.6Bowling & Billiards4.8 4.4 4.1Total$119.5 $105.3 $95.97Number of EmployeesThe number of employees worldwide is shown below by segment:     December 31, 2013 December 31, 2012 Total Union (domestic) Total Union (domestic)Marine Engine5,331 1,880 5,202 1,814Boat (A)3,748 — 4,393 —Fitness1,801 134 1,804 140Bowling & Billiards4,509 24 4,625 22Corporate (B)312 — 153 —Total15,701 2,038 16,177 1,976(A)2012 employee numbers include employees of those businesses treated as discontinued operations.(B)2013 Corporate numbers include approximately 150 information technology employees that were previously included in the divisional totals and were consolidated within Corporate beginning in 2013.The Company believes that the relationships between its employees, the labor unions and the Company remain stable. Environmental RequirementsRefer to Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of certain environmental proceedings.Available InformationBrunswick maintains an Internet Web site at http://www.brunswick.com that includes links to Brunswick's Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports (SEC Reports).

The Company's operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, which could adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of the Company's common stock. Worldwide economic conditions, particularly in the United States and Europe, have adversely affected the Company's industries, businesses and results of operations and may continue to do so. General worldwide economic conditions, particularly in the United States and Europe, continue to be challenging as economies continue to recover from the effects caused by the subprime lending and general credit market crisis, collateral effects on the finance and banking industries, increased energy costs, concerns about inflation, slower economic activity, low consumer confidence, and weak business conditions.  In times of economic uncertainty and contraction, consumers tend to have less discretionary income and to defer expenditures for discretionary items, which adversely affects the Company's financial performance, especially in its marine businesses.  A majority of the Company's businesses are cyclical in nature and are highly sensitive to personal discretionary spending levels, and their success is dependent upon favorable economic conditions, the overall level of consumer confidence and personal income levels.Demand for the Company's marine products has been significantly influenced by weak economic conditions, low consumer confidence, high unemployment and increased market volatility worldwide, especially in the United States and Europe.  Although increases have not been experienced in all product segments and geographic markets, the Company estimates that retail unit sales of powerboats in the United States again increased modestly during 2013.  However, unit sales remain down significantly from historical levels, particularly in the fiberglass sterndrive boat segment. Any deterioration in general economic conditions that further diminishes consumer confidence or discretionary income may further reduce the Company's sales and adversely affect its financial results, including increasing the potential for future impairment charges.  The Company cannot predict the timing or strength of economic recovery, either worldwide or in the specific markets where it competes.Fiscal concerns in the United States and Europe, including resolution of the debt ceiling and potential downgrade of the U.S. government's credit rating, may negatively impact the worldwide economy, and could have an adverse effect on the Company's industries, businesses and financial condition.Concerns regarding the U.S. debt ceiling and budget deficit, as well as the European debt and unemployment crisis, could have an adverse effect on worldwide economic conditions. These concerns also include the potential impact of additional credit agency downgrades.  Such fiscal concerns and the resulting downgrade of the U.S. government's credit rating could have a material adverse impact on worldwide economic conditions, the financial markets and the availability of credit and, consequently, may negatively affect the Company's industries, businesses and overall financial condition.Although consumer credit markets have improved, consumer credit market conditions continue to influence demand, especially for marine products, and may continue to do so.Customers often finance purchases of the Company's marine products, particularly boats. Credit market conditions continued to improve in 2013, but remained less favorable overall than those in existence prior to the decline in marine retail demand. While interest rates are generally lower, there continue to be fewer lenders, tighter underwriting and loan approval criteria, greater down payment requirements and negative loan equity, particularly in larger products.  If credit conditions worsen, and adversely affect the ability of customers to finance potential purchases at acceptable terms and interest rates, it could result in a decrease in sales of the Company's products or delay any improvement in its sales.The inability of the Company's dealers and distributors to secure adequate access to capital could adversely affect the Company's sales.The Company's dealers require adequate liquidity to finance their operations, including purchases of the Company's products.  Dealers are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could unfavorably affect their liquidity positions, including, among other things, continued access to adequate financing sources on a timely basis on reasonable terms.  These sources of financing are vital to the Company's ability to sell products through the Company's distribution network, particularly to its boat and engine dealers.  During the credit crisis which ensued before, during and after the 2009 recession, several third-party floorplan lenders ceased their lending operations or materially reduced their exposure.  A significant portion of the Company's domestic and international boat and engine sales to dealers are financed through entities affiliated with GE  Capital Corporation (GECC), including BAC (the Company's 49 percent owned joint venture, with the other 51 percent being owned by CDFV, a subsidiary of GECC),  which provides floorplan financing to domestic marine dealers.9The availability and terms of financing offered by the Company's dealer floorplan financing providers will continue to be influenced by a number of factors including: their ability to access certain capital markets, including the securitization and the commercial paper markets, and to fund their operations in a cost effective manner; the performance of their overall credit portfolios; their willingness to accept the risks associated with lending to marine dealers; and the overall creditworthiness of those dealers.  The Company's sales could be adversely affected if BAC were to be terminated, if further declines in floorplan financing availability occur, or if financing terms change unfavorably.  This could require the Company to find alternative sources of financing, including the Company providing this financing directly to dealers, which could require additional capital to fund the associated receivables.The Company's financial results may be adversely affected if it is unable to maintain effective distribution.The Company relies on third-party dealers and distributors to sell the majority of its products, particularly in the marine business.  The ability to maintain a reliable network of dealers is essential to the Company's success.  The Company faces competition from other boat manufacturers in attracting and retaining distributors and independent boat dealers. A significant deterioration in the number or effectiveness of the Company's dealers and distributors could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial results.Weakening demand for marine products could adversely affect the financial performance of the Company's dealers.  In particular, reduced cash flow from decreases in sales and tightening credit markets may impair a dealer's ability to fund operations.  Inability to fund operations can force dealers to cease business, and the Company may not be able to obtain alternate distribution in the vacated market. An inability to obtain alternate distribution could unfavorably affect the Company's net sales through reduced market presence. If conditions were to worsen, the Company anticipates that dealer failures or voluntary market exits could increase, especially if overall retail demand for boats materially declines. Adverse economic, credit and capital market conditions could have a negative impact on the Company's financial results.The Company does not frequently rely on short-term capital markets to meet its working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, pay dividends, or fund employee benefit programs; however, the Company does maintain short-term borrowing facilities which can be used to meet these capital requirements.  In addition, over the long term, the Company may determine that it is necessary to access the capital markets to refinance existing long-term indebtedness or for other initiatives.Adverse global economic conditions, market volatility and heightened governmental regulation could lead to volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets.  This could adversely affect the Company's ability to access capital and credit markets or increase the cost to do so, which could have a negative impact on its business, financial results and competitive position.Inventory reductions by major dealers, retailers and independent boat builders could adversely affect the Company's financial results.The Company and its dealers, retailers and other distributors could decide to reduce the number of units they hold, particularly if demand trails forecasted levels or if new product introductions are expected to replace older products, especially in the large fiberglass boat business.  Such efforts tend to result in wholesale reductions in excess of retail reductions and would likely result in lower production levels of the Company's products, thus resulting in lower rates of absorption of fixed costs in the Company's manufacturing facilities and lower margins. While actions taken continue to keep dealer inventories at appropriate levels, the potential need for future inventory reductions by dealers and independent boatbuilder customers could impair the Company's future sales and results of operations.The Company may be required to repurchase inventory or accounts of certain dealers.The Company has agreements with certain third-party finance companies to provide financing to the Company's customers to enable the purchase of its products.  In connection with these agreements, the Company either may have obligations to repurchase the Company's products from the finance company, or may have recourse obligations to the finance company on the dealer's receivables.  These obligations are triggered if the Company's dealers default on their debt obligations to the finance companies.The Company's maximum contingent obligation to repurchase inventory and its maximum contingent recourse obligations on customer receivables have been reduced in recent years and are less than the total balances of dealer financings outstanding under these programs, as the Company's obligations under certain of these arrangements are subject to caps, or are limited based on the age of product.  The Company's risk related to these arrangements is mitigated by the proceeds it receives on the resale of repurchased product to other dealers, or by recoveries on receivables purchased under the recourse obligations.The Company's inventory repurchase obligations relate primarily to the inventory floorplan credit facilities of the Company's boat and engine dealers. The Company's actual historical repurchase experience related to these repurchase arrangements has been substantially less than the Company's maximum contractual obligations. If dealers file for bankruptcy or cease operations, losses 10associated with the repurchase of the Company's products could be incurred.  In addition, as the repurchases may be triggered by dealer bankruptcies, the Company's net sales and earnings may be unfavorably affected as a result of reduced market coverage and the associated decline in sales.Declines in marine industry demand could cause an increase in future repurchase activity, or could require the Company to incur losses in excess of established reserves.  In addition, the Company's cash flow and loss experience could be adversely affected if repurchased inventory is not successfully distributed to other dealers in a timely manner, or if the recovery rate on the resale of the product declines.  In addition, the finance companies could require changes in repurchase or recourse terms that would result in an increase in the Company's contractual contingent obligations.The loss of key accounts or critical suppliers could harm the Company's business.If the Company were to experience the loss of a key account, its business could be negatively affected in a significant way.  Similarly, if one of the Company's most critical suppliers were to close its operations, cease manufacturing or otherwise fail to deliver an essential component necessary to the Company's manufacturing operations, it could have a detrimental effect on the Company's ability to manufacture and sell its products, resulting in an interruption in business operations and/or a loss of sales.  In an effort to mitigate the risk associated with the Company's reliance on such accounts and suppliers, it continually works to monitor such relationships, maintain a complete and competitive product lineup and identify alternative suppliers for key components.The Company's success depends upon the continued strength of its brands.The Company believes that its brands, including Brunswick, Mercury, Sea Ray, Boston Whaler and Life Fitness, are significant contributors to the success of the Company's business, and that maintaining and enhancing the brands are important to expanding the Company's customer base.  Failure to continue to promote and protect the Company's brands may adversely affect the Company's business and results of operations.The Company has a large fixed cost base that can affect its profitability in a declining sales environment.The fixed cost levels of operating marine production plants can put pressure on profit margins when sales and production decline. The Company's profitability is dependent, in part, on its ability to spread fixed costs over an increasing number of products sold and shipped, and if the Company makes a decision to reduce its rate of production, gross margins could be negatively affected. Consequently, decreased demand or the need to reduce inventories can lower the Company's ability to absorb fixed costs and materially impact its results of operations.Successfully managing its manufacturing footprint is critical to the Company's operating and financial results.A significant component of the Company's cost-reduction efforts has been a focus on reducing its manufacturing footprint by consolidating boat and engine production into fewer plants.  In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company began the consolidation of its Knoxville, Tennessee boat plant operation into its manufacturing facilities in Vonore, Tennessee and Palm Coast, Florida.  This transition was completed in 2013.  In addition, in the first quarter of 2013, the Company announced the consolidation of its yacht and motoryacht production at its Palm Coast, Florida manufacturing plant, and as a result, the Company suspended manufacturing at its Sykes Creek boat manufacturing facility in nearby Merritt Island, Florida as of the end of June 2013.The Company has also been making strategic capital investments in capacity expansion activities that will enable the affected businesses to successfully capture growth opportunities.  During 2013, the Company invested capital in a new pontoon facility in Fort Wayne, Indiana and began or continued plant expansion activities at its facilities in Edgewater, Florida, New York Mills, Minnesota and Fond du Lac, Wisconsin.Moving production to a different plant or expanding capacity at an existing facility involves risks, including the inability to start up production within the cost and timeframe estimated, supply product to customers when expected and attract a sufficient number of skilled workers to handle the additional production demands.  The inability to successfully implement the Company's manufacturing footprint initiatives could adversely affect its ability to meet customer demand for products and could increase the cost of production versus projections, both of which could result in a significant adverse impact on operating and financial results. Additionally, expenses and cost inefficiencies associated with plant consolidation, including severance costs and loss of trained employees with knowledge of the Company's business and operations, could exceed projections and negatively impact financial results.To successfully manage its manufacturing footprint, the Company also must enable growth through strategic capital investments, including facility and capacity expansion projects.  These capital improvement projects and expansions must be carefully managed to ensure cost targets are met, environmental, safety and other regulations are followed and high-quality workmanship is maintained.11 If the Company is not able to successfully implement its restructuring and growth initiatives, this could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and financial condition.The Company's ability to successfully generate improvements in cash flow will depend partly on its continued successful execution of the Company's restructuring and growth initiatives.  Demand for certain of the Company's marine products continues to be at historically low levels, mainly as a result of weak economic conditions. As a result, the Company has taken, and may in the future take, additional global restructuring activities to realign its cost structure with existing demand.  Restructuring activities could result in impairment charges and other expenses, which could adversely impact the Company's cash flow, results of operations or financial condition.The Company relies on third-party suppliers for the supply of the raw materials, parts and components necessary to manufacture its products.  The Company's financial results may be adversely affected by an increase in cost, disruption of supply or shortage of or defect in raw materials, parts or product components.Outside suppliers and contract manufacturers provide the Company with raw materials used in its manufacturing processes including oil, aluminum, copper, steel and resins, as well as product parts and components.  The prices for these raw materials, parts and components fluctuate depending on market conditions and in some instances, commodity prices.  Substantial increases in the prices of the Company's raw materials, parts and components would increase the Company's operating costs, and could reduce its profitability if the Company could not recoup the increased costs through increased product prices.  In addition, some components used in the Company's manufacturing processes, including furniture, upholstery and boat windshields are available from a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers.  Operational and financial difficulties that these or other suppliers may face in the future could adversely affect their ability to supply the Company with the parts and components it needs, which could significantly disrupt the Company's operations.  It may be difficult to find a replacement supplier for a limited or sole source raw material, part or component without significant delay or on commercially reasonable terms.  In addition, an uncorrected defect or supplier's variation in a raw material, part or component, either unknown to the Company or incompatible with the Company's manufacturing process, could harm the Company's ability to manufacture products.  Some of the risks that could disrupt the Company's operations, impair the Company's ability to deliver products to the Company's customers and negatively affect the Company's financial results include: an increase in the cost of, defects in or a sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of some of these raw materials, parts or products that may be caused by delayed start-up periods experienced by the Company's suppliers as they increase production efforts; financial pressures on the Company's suppliers due to a weakening economy; a deterioration of the Company's relationships with suppliers; or by events such as natural disasters, power outages or labor strikes. In addition to the risks described above regarding interruption of supplies, which are exacerbated in the case of single-source suppliers, the exclusive supplier of a key component potentially could exert significant bargaining power over price, quality, warranty claims, or other terms relating to a component.The Company's manufacturing operations increased production in 2013 and are expected to continue to do so in 2014, and consequently, the Company's need for raw materials and supplies will increase. The Company's suppliers must be prepared to ramp up operations and, in many cases, hire additional workers and/or expand capacity in order to fulfill the orders placed by the Company and other customers.  The Company experienced periodic supply shortages in 2013.  The Company continues to work to address this issue by identifying alternative suppliers, working to secure adequate inventories of critical supplies and continually monitoring the capabilities of its supplier base. In the future, however, the Company may continue to experience shortages of, delayed delivery of and/or increased prices for key materials, parts and supplies that are essential to its manufacturing operations.The Company's pension funding requirements and expenses are affected by certain factors outside its control, including the performance of plan assets, the discount rate used to value liabilities, actuarial data and experience and legal and regulatory changes.The Company's funding obligations and pension expense for its four qualified pension plans are driven by the performance of assets set aside in trusts for these plans, the discount rate used to value the plans' liabilities, actuarial data and experience, and legal and regulatory funding requirements.  Changes in these factors could have an adverse impact on the Company's results of operations, liquidity or shareholders' equity.  In addition, a portion of the Company's pension plan assets are invested in equity securities, which can experience significant declines if economic conditions or financial markets weaken.  The level of the Company's funding of its qualified pension plan liabilities was approximately 79 percent as of December 31, 2013. The Company's future pension expenses and funding requirements could increase significantly due to the effect of adverse changes in the discount rate and asset levels along with a decline in the estimated return on plan assets. In addition, as a result of changes in regulations, the Company could be legally required to make increased contributions to the pension plans, and these contributions could be material and negatively affect the Company's cash flow.12Higher energy and fuel costs can adversely affect the Company's results.Higher energy and fuel costs result in increases in operating expenses at the Company's manufacturing facilities and in the cost of shipping products to customers.  In addition, increases in energy costs can adversely affect the pricing and availability of petroleum-based raw materials such as resins and foam that are used in many of the Company's marine products.  Also, higher fuel prices may have an adverse effect on demand for marine retail products, as they increase the cost of boat ownership and possibly affect product usage, and may have a negative impact on operating margins, particularly in the Fitness segment, as transportation costs increase.  Finally, because heating and air conditioning comprise a significant part of the cost of operating a bowling center, any increase in the price of energy could adversely affect the operating margins of the Company's bowling centers.The Company's profitability may suffer as a result of competitive pricing and other pressures.The introduction of lower-priced alternative products by other companies can hurt the Company's competitive position in all of its businesses.  The Company is constantly subject to competitive pressures, particularly in the outboard engine market, in which predominantly Asian manufacturers often have pursued a strategy of aggressive pricing, particularly during periods when the Japanese yen weakens versus the U.S. dollar.  Such pricing pressure may limit the Company's ability to increase prices for its products in response to raw material and other cost increases and negatively affect the Company's profit margins.In addition, the Company's independent boat builder customers may react negatively to potential competition for their products from Brunswick's own boat brands, which can lead them to purchase marine engines and marine engine supplies from competing marine engine manufacturers and may negatively affect demand for the Company's products.The Company's ability to remain competitive depends on the successful introduction of new product offerings and the ability to meet its customers' expectations.The Company believes that its customers rigorously evaluate their suppliers on the basis of product quality along with new product innovation and development capability. The Company's ability to remain competitive and meet its growth objectives may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development, such as an inability to develop viable new products, gain market acceptance of new products, generate sufficient capital to fund new product development or obtain adequate intellectual property protection for new products. To meet ever-changing consumer demands, the timing of market entry and pricing of new products are critical.  As a result, the Company may not be able to introduce new products necessary to remain competitive in all markets that it serves.  Furthermore, the Company must deliver quality products that meet or exceed its customers' expectations regarding product quality and after-sales service.The Company competes with a variety of other activities for consumers' scarce discretionary income and leisure time.The vast majority of the Company's products are used for recreational purposes, and demand for the Company's products can be adversely affected by competition from other activities that occupy consumers' time, including other forms of recreation as well as religious, cultural and community activities. Additionally, the decrease in consumers' discretionary income as a result of the recent economic environment has influenced consumers' willingness to purchase and enjoy the Company's products.The Company manufactures and sells products that create exposure to potential product liability, warranty liability, personal injury and property damage claims and litigation.The Company's products may expose it to potential product liability, warranty liability, personal injury or property damage claims relating to the use of those products. The Company's manufacturing consolidation efforts and production of new products could result in product quality issues, thereby increasing the risk of litigation and potential liability. To address this risk, the Company has established a global, enterprise-wide organization charged with the responsibility of addressing, reviewing and reporting on product integrity issues.  Historically, the resolution of such claims has not materially adversely affected the Company's business, and the Company maintains insurance coverage to mitigate a portion of these risks, which it believes to be adequate.  However, the Company may experience material losses in the future, incur significant costs to defend claims or experience claims in excess of its insurance coverage or claims that will not be covered by insurance.  Furthermore, the Company's reputation may be adversely affected by such claims, whether or not successful, including potential negative publicity about its products. The Company records reserves for known potential liabilities, but there is the possibility that actual losses may exceed these reserves and therefore negatively impact earnings.Environmental laws and zoning and other requirements can inhibit the Company's ability to grow its marine businesses.Environmental restrictions, boat plant emission restrictions and permitting and zoning requirements can limit production capacity, access to water for boating, as well as marina and storage space.  In addition, certain jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States require or are considering requiring a license to operate a recreational boat.  While such licensing requirements 13are not expected to be unduly restrictive, they may deter potential customers, thereby reducing the Company's sales.  Furthermore, regulations allowing the sale of fuel containing higher levels of ethanol for automobiles, which is not appropriate or intended for use in marine engines, may nonetheless result in increased warranty, service and other claims against the Company if boaters mistakenly use this fuel in marine engines, causing damage to and the degradation of components in their marine engines.Compliance with environmental regulations affecting marine engines will increase costs and may reduce demand for the Company's products.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's emission regulations require certain gasoline sterndrive and inboard engines to be equipped with a catalyst exhaust monitoring and treatment system.  It is possible that environmental regulatory bodies may impose higher emissions standards in the future for these and other marine engines including outboards.  Compliance with these standards would increase the cost to manufacture and the price to the customer for the Company's engines, which could in turn reduce consumer demand for the Company's marine products and potentially reduce operating margins. An increase in the cost of marine engines, an increase in the retail price to consumers, or unforeseen delays in compliance with environmental regulations affecting these products, could have an adverse effect on the Company's results of operations.The Company's businesses may be adversely affected by compliance obligations and liabilities under various laws and regulations.The Company is subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including product safety, environmental, health and safety laws and other regulations.  While the Company believes that it maintains all requisite licenses and permits and that it is in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, a failure to satisfy these and other regulatory requirements could cause the Company to incur fines or penalties, and compliance could increase its cost of operations.  The adoption of additional laws, rules and regulations could also increase the Company's capital or operating costs.The Company's manufacturing processes involve the use, handling, storage and contracting for recycling or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes.  Accordingly, the Company is subject to regulations regarding these substances, and the misuse or mishandling of such substances could expose it to liabilities, including claims for property or natural resources damages or personal injury, or fines.  The Company is also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property.  If a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from any of the Company's current or former properties or another location where it has disposed of hazardous materials, the Company may be held liable for the contamination, regardless of knowledge or whether it was at fault in connection with the release, and the amount of such liability could be material.Additionally, the Company is subject to laws governing its relationship with its employees, including, but not limited to, employee wage, hour and benefit issues, such as pension funding and health care benefits.  Changes to such legislation could increase the cost of the Company's operations. Specifically, the effects of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, once ultimately determined and fully implemented, may have an adverse effect on the financial operations of the Company, primarily in the bowling retail business.Increases in income tax rates or changes in income tax laws or enforcement could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial results.Changes in domestic and international tax legislation could expose the Company to additional tax liability.  Although the Company carefully monitors changes in tax laws and works to mitigate the impact of proposed changes, such changes or failure to extend legislation, including the research and development credit, may negatively impact the Company's financial results.  In addition, any increase in individual income tax rates, such as those implemented at the beginning of 2013, would negatively affect the Company's potential customers' discretionary income and could decrease the demand for its products.  Finally, governments in certain foreign jurisdictions are increasing their audit activity in an effort to obtain additional revenue.  This increase in activity involves increased costs to the Company for having to resolve these potential disputes and from the potential additional taxes which may be assessed.If the Company's intellectual property protection is inadequate, others may be able to use its technologies and thereby impair the Company's ability to compete, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company, its financial condition and results of operations.The Company regards much of the technology underlying its products as proprietary.  The Company relies on a combination of patents, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws; employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements; and other contracts to establish and protect its technology and other intellectual property rights.  The steps the Company takes to protect its proprietary technology may be inadequate to prevent misappropriation of the Company's technology, or third parties may independently develop similar technology.   The agreements may be breached or terminated, the Company may not have adequate remedies for 14any such breach, and existing patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws afford it limited protection.  Policing unauthorized use of the Company's intellectual property is difficult, particularly in many regions outside the United States.  A third party could copy or otherwise obtain and use the Company's products or technology without authorization. Litigation may be necessary for the Company to defend against claims of infringement or to protect its intellectual property rights and could result in substantial cost and divert the attention of management.  Further, the Company might not prevail in such litigation and the Company may be forced to seek licenses or royalty arrangements from third parties, which the Company may not be able to obtain on reasonable terms, or the Company may be forced to stop using products that included the challenged intellectual property, which could harm its business.Some of the Company's operations are conducted by joint ventures that are not operated solely for its benefit.Some of the Company's operations are carried on through jointly owned companies such as BAC and Tohatsu Marine Corporation.  With respect to these joint ventures, the Company shares ownership and management responsibility of these companies with one or more parties who may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities or resources as the Company.  These joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of all co-owners, rather than for the Company's exclusive benefit. Changes in currency exchange rates can adversely affect the Company's results.The Company derives a portion of its revenues from outside the United States (approximately 37 percent in 2013).  The Company manufactures its products primarily in the United States and the costs of the Company's products are generally denominated in U.S. dollars, although the increase in manufacturing and sourcing of products and materials outside the United States continues to be a strategic focus.  The Company sells a portion of these products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.  Consequently, a strong U.S. dollar can make the Company's products less price-competitive relative to products manufactured outside the United States, and can adversely affect its financial performance.Although the Company enters into currency exchange contracts to reduce its risk related to currency exchange fluctuations, it is impossible to hedge against all currency risk, especially over the long term, and changes in the relative values of currencies may occur from time to time and, in some instances, affect the Company's results of operations.  The Company is also exposed to the risk that its counterparties to hedging contracts could default on their obligations, which may have an adverse effect on the Company.A growing portion of the Company's revenue may be derived from international sources, which exposes it to additional uncertainty.Approximately 37 percent of the Company's 2013 sales were derived from sources outside the United States and the Company intends to continue to expand its international operations and customer base as part of its growth strategy.  Sales outside the United States, especially in emerging markets, are subject to various risks, including government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions, tariffs, fuel duties, inflation, difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems, compliance with international laws, treaties and regulations and unexpected changes in regulatory environments, disruptions in distribution, dependence on foreign personnel and unions, as well as economic and social instability.  In addition, there may be tax inefficiencies in repatriating cash from non-U.S. subsidiaries.  If the Company continues to expand its business globally, its success will depend, in part, on the Company's ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks.  These and other factors may have a material impact on the Company's international operations or its business as a whole.An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill, trade names and other long-lived assets could negatively affect the Company's consolidated results of operations and net worth.Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as the Company's trade names, are recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition and are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise.  In evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill and trade names, the Company makes assumptions regarding future operating performance, business trends and market and economic conditions.  Such analyses further require the Company to make certain assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates.  There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and in applying these factors to the assessment of goodwill and trade name recoverability.  Goodwill reviews are prepared using estimates of the fair value of reporting units based on the estimated present value of future discounted cash flows.  The Company could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill or trade names prior to the annual assessment if it experiences disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, a divestiture of a significant component of the Company's business or market capitalization declines.The Company also continually evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of its definite-lived intangible assets, excluding goodwill, and other long-lived assets may warrant revision or whether 15the remaining balance of such assets may not be recoverable.  The Company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flow over the remaining life of the asset in measuring whether the asset is recoverable.If the future operating performance of the Company's reporting units is not sufficient, the Company could be required to record non-cash impairment charges.  Impairment charges could substantially affect the Company's reported earnings in the periods such charges are recorded.  In addition, impairment charges could indicate a reduction in business value which could limit the Company's ability to obtain adequate financing in the future.  As of December 31, 2013, goodwill was approximately 10 percent of total assets and included $270.9 million of goodwill related to the Life Fitness segment and $20.8 million of goodwill related to the Marine Engine segment.Adverse weather conditions can have a negative effect on marine and retail bowling center revenues.Weather conditions can have a significant effect on the Company's operating and financial results, especially in the marine and retail bowling center businesses.  Sales of the Company's marine products are generally stronger just before and during spring and summer, and favorable weather during these months generally has a positive effect on consumer demand.  Conversely, unseasonably cool weather, excessive rainfall or drought conditions during these periods can reduce demand.  Hurricanes and other storms can result in the disruption of the Company's distribution channel, operations or supply chain. In addition, severely inclement weather on weekends and holidays, particularly during the winter months, can adversely affect patronage of the Company's bowling centers and, therefore, revenues in the retail bowling center business. Additionally, in the event that climate change occurs, which could result in environmental changes including, but not limited to, severe weather, rising sea levels or reduced access to water, the Company's business could be disrupted and negatively affected.Instability in locations where the Company maintains a significant presence could adversely impact the Company's business operations.The Company has established a global presence, with manufacturing, sales, distribution and retail locations around the world.  Changing conditions in those locations, including, but not limited to, political instability, civil unrest and an increase in criminal activity, could have a negative impact on the Company's local manufacturing and other business operations.  Decreased stability in those regions where the Company conducts business poses a risk of business interruption and delays in shipments of materials, components and finished goods, as well as a risk of decreased local retail demand for the Company's products in those regions.Catastrophic events, including natural and environmental disasters, could have a negative effect on the Company's operations and financial results.The occurrence of natural and environmental disasters, including hurricanes, floods, earthquakes and environmental spills, could decrease consumer demand for and sales of the Company's products.  If such an occurrence takes place in one of Brunswick's major sales markets, the Company could experience a decrease in sales.  Additionally, if such an event occurs near the Company's business, manufacturing facilities or key suppliers' facilities, the affected locations could experience an interruption in business operations and/or their operating systems.The Company's operations are dependent upon the services of key individuals, the loss of whom may have an adverse effect.The Company's operations depend, in part, on the efforts of the Company's executive officers and other key employees.  In addition, the Company's future success will depend on, among other factors, its ability to attract and retain other qualified personnel. The loss of the services of any of the Company's key employees or the failure to attract or retain employees could have an adverse effect on the Company.  The Company's restructuring activities, which result in employee terminations, may make it more difficult for the Company to attract or retain employees and it may be adversely affected for some time by the loss of trained employees with knowledge of the Company's business and industries.  If the Company is unable to attract and retain qualified individuals, or the Company's costs to do so increase significantly, the Company's operations could be adversely affected. The Company's business operations could be negatively impacted by the failure of its information technology systems.The Company's global business operations are managed through a variety of information technology (IT) systems.  These systems govern all aspects of the company's operations around the world.  The Company is dependent on these systems for all commercial transactions, customer interactions, and image projection.  Some of the systems are based on legacy technology and operate with a minimal level of available support.  If one of these legacy systems or another of the Company's key IT systems were to suffer a failure, or if the Company's IT systems were unable to communicate effectively, this could result in missed or delayed sales, or lost opportunities for cost reduction or efficient cash management.  The Company exchanges information with hundreds of trading partners across all aspects of its commercial operations.  Any breach in security or disruption of the 16communications could result in erroneous transactions or loss of reputation and confidence.  The company has numerous portals to engage in e-commerce and e-marketing; therefore, the company must remain diligent in protecting itself from malicious cyber attacks.  A successful cyber attack could result in a disruption of services, fraudulent transactions, or disclosure of confidential information.  This could negatively affect the Company's relationships with its trading partners and damage its image and reputation"

In 2013, Brunswick will again focus on executing its financial and operational strategic growth initiatives as well as on cost reductions and operating efficiencies throughout the Company in order to sustain earnings growth.  In the longer term, Brunswick's strategy remains consistent: to design, develop and introduce high-quality products featuring innovative technology and styling; to distribute products through a model that benefits its partners - dealers and distributors - and to provide world-class service to its customers; to develop and maintain low-cost manufacturing processes and to continually improve productivity and efficiency; to manufacture and distribute products globally with local and regional styling; to continue implementing the Company's capital strategy which includes maintaining a strong balance sheet, lowering debt and funding pension obligations; and to attract and retain skilled and knowledgeable people.  These strategic objectives support the Company's plans to grow by expanding its existing core businesses.  The Company's primary objective is to enhance shareholder value by achieving returns on investments that exceed its cost of capital. Refer to Note 5 – Segment Information and Note 2 – Discontinued Operations in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company's segments and discontinued operations, including net sales, operating earnings and total assets by segment. Marine Engine SegmentThe Marine Engine segment, which had net sales of $1,988.5 million in 2012, consists of the Mercury Marine Group (Mercury Marine).  The Company believes its Marine Engine segment has the largest dollar sales and unit volume of recreational marine engines in the world, along with a leading marine parts and accessories business. Mercury Marine manufactures and markets a full range of outboard engines, sterndrive propulsion systems and inboard engines under the Mercury, Mercury MerCruiser, Mariner, Mercury Racing, Mercury Sport Jet and Mercury Jet Drive, MotorGuide, Axius and Zeus brand names. In addition, Mercury Marine manufactures and markets marine parts and accessories under the Quicksilver, Mercury Precision Parts, Mercury Propellers, Attwood, Land 'N' Sea, Kellogg Marine Supply, Diversified Marine Products, Sea Choice and MotorGuide brand names, including marine electronics and control integration systems, steering systems, instruments, controls, propellers, trolling motors, fuel systems, service parts and marine lubricants. Mercury Marine's outboard engines, sterndrive engines and inboard engines are sold to independent boat builders, local, state and foreign governments, and to the Company's Boat segment. In addition, Mercury Marine's outboard engines are sold to end-users through a global network of more than 7,000 marine dealers and distributors, specialty marine retailers and marine service centers. Mercury Marine also supplies integrated diesel propulsion systems to the worldwide recreational and commercial marine markets, including the Company's Boat segment.  During the second quarter of 2012, the Company and Cummins Inc. transitioned to the parent companies the business activities of Cummins MerCruiser Diesel Marine LLC (CMD), the joint venture between Mercury Marine and Cummins Marine, a division of Cummins Inc. and began the liquidation process of the joint venture.  As part of the transition, Mercury Marine has integrated CMD's high-speed diesel engine line into its product portfolio and sells, services and supports these products through its global sales and distribution network. Mercury Marine manufactures four-stroke outboard engine models ranging from 2.5 to 350 horsepower and two-stroke OptiMax outboard engines, all of which feature Mercury's direct fuel injection (DFI) technology, ranging from 75 to 300 horsepower.  All of these low-emission engines are in compliance with current U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requirements.  Mercury Marine's four-stroke outboard engines include Verado, a collection of supercharged outboards ranging from 150 to 350 horsepower, and Mercury Marine's naturally aspirated four-stroke outboards, ranging from 2.5 to 150 horsepower including the introduction 1of the 150 FourStroke, which is quickly becoming known for its light weight, fuel efficiency and performance. In addition, most of Mercury's sterndrive and inboard engines are now available with catalyst exhaust monitoring and treatment systems, and all are compliant with environmental regulations adopted by the State of California, effective January 1, 2008, and by the EPA, effective January 1, 2010. To promote advanced propulsion systems with improved handling, performance and efficiency, Mercury Marine manufactures and markets advanced boat steering and engine control systems under the brand names of Zeus and Axius. Mercury Marine's sterndrive and outboard engines are produced domestically in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, with outboard engines also produced internationally in China and Japan.  During the third quarter of 2009, the Company announced plans to consolidate engine production by transferring sterndrive engine manufacturing operations from its Stillwater, Oklahoma plant to its Fond du Lac, Wisconsin plant. This plant transfer was completed in the second quarter of 2012, at which time the real estate related to the former Stillwater facility was sold.  Mercury Marine manufactures 40, 50 and 60 horsepower four-stroke outboard engines in a facility in China, and produces smaller outboard engines in Japan pursuant to a joint venture with its partner, Tohatsu Corporation. Mercury Marine sources certain engine components from a global supply base of Asian, European and Latin American suppliers and manufactures additional engine component parts at its Fond du Lac facility and plants in Florida and Mexico. Until April 2012, CMD manufactured diesel marine propulsion systems in South Carolina. Mercury Marine also operates a remanufacturing business for engines and service parts in Wisconsin.  In addition, Mercury Marine has an equity ownership interest in a company that manufactures boats under the brand names Bella, Flipper and Aquador in Finland.    Mercury Marine's parts and accessories distribution businesses include: Land 'N' Sea, Kellogg Marine Supply and Diversified Marine Products. These businesses are the leading distributors of marine parts and accessories throughout North America, offering same-day or next-day delivery service to a broad array of marine service facilities. Inter-company sales to the Company's Boat segment represented approximately 12 percent of Mercury Marine's sales in 2012.  Domestic demand for the Marine Engine segment's products is seasonal, with sales generally highest in the second calendar quarter of the year. Boat SegmentThe Boat segment consists of the Brunswick Boat Group (Boat Group), which manufactures and markets the following products: fiberglass pleasure boats; luxury motoryachts; offshore fishing boats; aluminum fishing boats; inflatable boats; pontoon boats and deck boats.  The Company believes that its Boat Group, which had net sales of $1,002.6 million during 2012, has the largest dollar sales and unit volume of pleasure motorboats in the world. The Boat Group manages Brunswick's boat brands; evaluates and optimizes the Boat segment's boat portfolio; promotes recreational boating services and activities to enhance the consumer experience and dealer profitability; and speeds the introduction of new technologies into the boat manufacturing and design processes. The Boat Group is comprised of the following boat brands: Sea Ray yachts, sport yachts, sport cruisers and runabouts; Bayliner sport cruisers and runabouts; Meridian motoryachts; Boston Whaler and Lund fiberglass fishing boats; and Crestliner, Cypress Cay, Harris FloteBote, Lowe, Lund and Princecraft aluminum fishing, utility, pontoon boats and deck boats. The Boat Group also includes a commercial and governmental sales unit that sells products to commercial customers, as well as the United States government and state, local and foreign governments. The Boat Group procures most of its outboard engines, gasoline sterndrive engines and gasoline inboard engines from Brunswick's Marine Engine segment.During the first quarter of 2012, Brunswick realigned its global marine operations causing changes to the components of the Marine Engine and Boat Group reportable segments.  Several Brunswick boat brands based in Europe and Asia, which include Quicksilver, Uttern and Rayglass (Protector and Legend), each of which were previously included in the Marine Engine segment, were moved under the management of the Boat Group.  Boats sold and marketed under these names are typically equipped with engines manufactured by Mercury Marine and often include other parts and accessories supplied by Mercury Marine. The Boat Group has active manufacturing facilities in Florida, Indiana, Minnesota, Missouri, Tennessee, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand and Portugal, as well as additional inactive manufacturing facilities in Florida, North Carolina and Tennessee.  The Boat Group utilizes contract manufacturing facilities in Argentina and Poland.  The Boat Group has constructed a manufacturing plant in Joinville, Santa Catarina, Brazil, which has nearly 150,000 square feet of manufacturing space.  Production at this new facility, which is leased, began in the third quarter of 2012.  This facility will eventually employ up to 150 people and will produce several Bayliner and Sea Ray sport boat and cruiser models which, along with other Brunswick boat brands and models, will be sold through a network of local dealers.2During 2012, the Boat Group continued its restructuring activities by reducing its workforce and consolidating manufacturing operations.  As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company began the consolidation of its Knoxville, Tennessee boat plant operation into its manufacturing facilities in Vonore, Tennessee and Palm Coast, Florida.  Finally, in 2012, the Boat Group divested several idle facilities including former operating facilities and other real property holdings in Cumberland, Maryland and Cape Canaveral, Florida.  The Boat Group's products are sold to end-users through a global network of approximately 2,850 dealers and distributors, each of which carries one or more of Brunswick's boat brands. Sales to the Boat Group's largest dealer, MarineMax Inc., which has multiple locations and carries a number of the Boat Group's product lines, represented approximately 16 percent of Boat Group sales in 2012. Domestic demand for pleasure boats is seasonal, with sales generally highest in the second calendar quarter of the year.Fitness SegmentBrunswick's Fitness segment is comprised of its Life Fitness division (Life Fitness), which designs, manufactures and markets a full line of reliable, high-quality cardiovascular fitness equipment (including treadmills, total body cross-trainers, stair climbers and stationary exercise bicycles) and strength-training equipment under the Life Fitness and Hammer Strength brands. The Company believes that its Fitness segment, which had net sales of $635.9 million during 2012, is the world's largest manufacturer of commercial fitness equipment and a leading manufacturer of high-quality consumer fitness equipment. Life Fitness' commercial sales customers include health clubs, fitness facilities operated by professional sports teams, the military, governmental agencies, corporations, hotels, schools and universities. Commercial sales are made to customers through Life Fitness' direct sales force, domestic dealers, and international distributors. Consumer products are available at specialty retailers, select mass merchants, sporting goods stores, through international distributors, and on the Life Fitness Web site. The Fitness segment's principal manufacturing facilities are located in Illinois, Kentucky, Minnesota and Hungary, with third party contract manufacturing utilized in China and Taiwan.  Life Fitness distributes its products worldwide from regional warehouses and production facilities. Demand for Life Fitness products is seasonal, with sales generally highest in the fourth quarter of the year.Bowling & Billiards SegmentThe Bowling & Billiards segment is comprised of the Brunswick Bowling & Billiards division (BB&B), which had net sales of $322.3 million during 2012. The Company believes BB&B is a leading worldwide full-line designer, manufacturer and marketer of bowling and billiards products and operator of retail bowling centers. BB&B's bowling products business designs, manufactures and markets a wide variety of bowling products, including capital equipment (such as automatic pinsetters and scoring devices), bowling balls and aftermarket products (such as lane machines, pinsetter parts, lane conditioners and lane cleaners). Through licensing arrangements, BB&B also offers a wide array of bowling consumer products, including bowling shoes, bags and accessories. BB&B operates 95 bowling centers in the United States, Canada and Europe.  BB&B retail bowling centers offer bowling and, depending on size and location, may also offer the following activities and facilities: restaurants, lounges, snack bars, billiards, video and redemption games, laser tag, pro shops and meeting and party rooms.  Of the Company's 95 bowling centers, 42 have been converted into Brunswick Zones, which are bowling centers that offer an array of active entertainment activities for our guests. BB&B has further enhanced the Brunswick Zone concept with expanded Brunswick Zone entertainment centers, branded Brunswick Zone XL, which are larger than typical Brunswick Zones and feature multiple entertainment offerings.  BB&B operates 12 Brunswick Zone XL centers. BB&B's billiards business was established in 1845 and is Brunswick's heritage business.  The Company believes it is a leading designer and marketer of billiards tables.  BB&B designs and/or markets billiards tables, table tennis tables, air powered table hockey games, billiard balls, cues and other gaming tables, as well as game room furniture and related accessories, under the Brunswick and Contender brands. BB&B's primary manufacturing and distribution facilities are located in Michigan, Wisconsin, Hungary and Mexico. Brunswick's bowling and billiards products are sold through a variety of channels, including distributors, dealers, mass merchandisers, bowling centers and other retailers, and directly to consumers through the Internet and other outlets. BB&B's sales are seasonal with sales generally highest in the first and fourth calendar quarters of the year.3Discontinued OperationsOn December 31, 2012, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to exit its Hatteras and Cabo boat businesses.  As a result, these businesses, which were previously reported in the Company's Boat segment, are being reported as discontinued operations and are reported in separate lines in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for all periods presented. The assets and liabilities of these businesses meet the held for sale accounting criteria and have been aggregated and reported on separate lines of the Consolidated Balance Sheets for all periods presented.  Brunswick's results as discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K reflect continuing operations only, unless otherwise noted.  Financial ServicesThe Company, through its Brunswick Financial Services Corporation (BFS) subsidiary, owns a 49 percent interest in a joint venture, Brunswick Acceptance Company, LLC (BAC). CDF Ventures, LLC (CDFV), a subsidiary of GE Capital Corporation, owns the remaining 51 percent. Under the terms of the joint venture agreement, BAC provides secured wholesale inventory floorplan financing to the Company's engine and boat dealers.  The term of the BAC joint venture extends through June 30, 2014. The joint venture agreement contains provisions allowing for the renewal of the agreement or purchase of the joint venture by either of the parties at the end of this term. Alternatively, either partner may allow the agreement to terminate at the end of its term. Additionally, Brunswick offers financial services through Brunswick Product Protection Corporation, which provides marine dealers the opportunity to offer extended product warranties to retail customers, and through Blue Water Dealer Services, Inc., which provides retail financial services to marine dealers. Each company allows Brunswick to offer a more complete line of financial services to its boat and marine engine dealers and their customers. Refer to Note 9 – Financial Services in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information about the Company's financial services. DistributionBrunswick utilizes distributors, dealers and retailers (Dealers) for the majority of its boat sales and significant portions of its sales of marine engine, fitness and bowling and billiards products. Brunswick has over 16,000 Dealers serving its business segments worldwide. Brunswick's marine Dealers typically carry one or more of the following product categories - boats, engines and related parts and accessories. Brunswick owns Land 'N' Sea, Kellogg Marine Supply and Diversified Marine Products, the primary parts and accessories distribution platforms for the Company's Marine Engine segment. These businesses are the leading distributors of marine parts and accessories throughout North America, with 14 distribution warehouses located throughout the United States and Canada offering same-day or next-day delivery service to a broad array of marine service facilities and Dealers. Brunswick's Dealers are independent companies or proprietors that range in size from small, family-owned businesses to a large, publicly-traded corporation with substantial revenues and multiple locations. Some Dealers sell Brunswick's products exclusively, while others also carry competitors' products. Brunswick partners with its boat dealer network to improve quality, service, distribution and delivery of parts and accessories to enhance the boating customer's experience. Demand for a significant portion of Brunswick's products is seasonal, and a number of Brunswick's Dealers are relatively small or highly-leveraged. As a result, many Dealers require financial assistance to support their businesses, enabling them to provide stable channels for Brunswick's products. In addition to the financing offered by BAC, the Company provides its Dealers with assistance, including incentive programs, loans, loan guarantees and inventory repurchase commitments, under which the Company is obligated to repurchase inventory from a finance company in the event of a Dealer's default. The Company believes that these arrangements are in its best interest; however, the financial support that the Company provides to its Dealers exposes the Company to credit and business risk. Brunswick's business units, along with BAC, maintain active credit operations to manage this financial exposure, and the Company continually seeks opportunities to sustain and improve the financial health of its various distribution channel partners. Refer to Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these arrangements. 4International OperationsBrunswick's sales to customers in markets other than the United States were $1,397.2 million (38 percent of net sales),  $1,483.6 million (40 percent of net sales) and $1,366.6 million (41 percent of net sales) in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The Company transacts a significant portion of its sales in non-U.S. markets in local currencies, and the cost of its products is generally denominated in U.S. dollars. As a result, the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar affects the financial results of Brunswick's non-U.S. operations. Non-U.S. sales are set forth in Note 5 – Segment Information in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and are also included in the table below, which details Brunswick's non-U.S. sales by region:        (in millions)2012 2011 2010Europe$477.4 $596.3 $591.7Canada318.3 301.7 244.9Pacific Rim307.7 289.7 265.7Latin America205.5 191.6 183.6Africa & Middle East88.3 104.3 80.7Total$1,397.2 $1,483.6 $1,366.6Marine Engine segment non-U.S. sales represented approximately 46 percent of Brunswick's non-U.S. sales in 2012. The segment's principal non-U.S. operations include the following:•    An outboard engine assembly plant in Suzhou, China;•    An outboard engine assembly plant operated by a joint venture in Japan;•A component manufacturing facility in Mexico;•Sales, service and applications engineering offices in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand and Singapore; and•    Sales or representative offices in China, Dubai, Finland, France, Italy, Norway, Russia, Sweden and Switzerland.Boat segment non-U.S. sales comprised approximately 27 percent of Brunswick's non-U.S. sales in 2012.  A portion of the Boat Group's products are manufactured or assembled in Brazil, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand and Portugal, as well as in boat plants owned and operated by third parties in Argentina and Poland that perform contract manufacturing for the Company, and are sold worldwide through Dealers. The Boat Group has sales or import offices in Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Singapore.Fitness segment non-U.S. sales comprised approximately 22 percent of Brunswick's non-U.S. sales in 2012. Life Fitness sells its products worldwide and has sales and distribution centers in Brazil, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, the Netherlands, Spain and the United Kingdom. The Fitness segment manufactures strength-training equipment and select lines of cardiovascular equipment in Hungary for its international markets, and has facilities in China and Taiwan that perform contract manufacturing.  Bowling & Billiards segment non-U.S. sales comprised approximately 5 percent of Brunswick's non-U.S. sales in 2012. BB&B sells its products worldwide, has a sales office in Germany, and operates plants that manufacture automatic pinsetters in Hungary and bowling balls in Mexico. BB&B operates retail bowling centers in Austria, Canada and Germany. Raw Materials and SuppliesBrunswick purchases a wide variety of raw materials from its supplier base, including oil, aluminum, steel and resins, as well as product parts and components, such as engine blocks and boat windshields. The prices for these raw materials, parts and components fluctuate depending on market conditions. Significant increases in the cost of such materials would raise the Company's production costs, which could reduce the Company's profitability if the Company cannot recoup the increased costs through higher product prices. As Brunswick's manufacturing operations raised production levels in 2012, the Company's need for raw materials and supplies increased. Moving into 2013, Brunswick's suppliers will need to increase their manufacturing operations to meet the rising demand for their products and, in many cases, may need to hire additional workers in order to fulfill the orders placed by Brunswick and other customers. During 2012, the Company experienced some shortages, and delayed delivery, of certain materials, parts and supplies essential to its manufacturing operations. The Company has addressed and will continue to address this issue by identifying 5alternative suppliers, working to secure adequate inventories of critical supplies and continually monitoring the capabilities of its supplier base.Additionally, some components used in Brunswick's manufacturing processes, including engine blocks and boat windshields, are available from a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers.  Operational and financial difficulties that these or other suppliers currently face or may face in the future could adversely affect their ability to supply Brunswick with the parts and components it needs, which could significantly disrupt Brunswick's operations. The Company also continues to expand its global procurement operations to better leverage its purchasing power across its divisions and to improve supply chain and cost efficiencies. The Company mitigates its commodity price risk on certain raw material purchases by using derivatives to hedge exposure related to changes in commodity prices. Intellectual PropertyBrunswick has, and continues to obtain, patent rights covering certain features of its products and processes. By law, Brunswick's patent rights, which consist of patents and patent licenses, have limited lives and expire periodically. The Company believes that its patent rights are important to its competitive position in all of its business segments. In the Marine Engine segment, patent rights principally relate to features of outboard engines and inboard-outboard drives, hybrid drives and pod drives, including: die-cast powerheads; cooling and exhaust systems; drivetrain, clutch and gearshift mechanisms; boat/engine mountings; shock-absorbing tilt mechanisms; ignition systems; propellers; marine vessel control systems; fuel and oil injection systems; supercharged engines; outboard mid-section structures; segmented cowls; hydraulic trim, tilt and steering; screw compressor charge air cooling systems; a range of proprietary metal alloys and airflow silencers. In the Boat segment, patent rights principally relate to processes for manufacturing fiberglass hulls, decks and components for boat products, as well as patent rights related to interiors and other boat features and components. In the Fitness segment, patent rights principally relate to fitness equipment designs and components, including patents covering internal processes, programming functions, displays, design features and styling. In the Bowling & Billiards segment, patent rights principally relate to computerized bowling scorers and bowling center management systems, bowling center furniture, bowling lanes, lane conditioning machines and bowling center equipment, bowling balls, and billiards table designs and components. The following are Brunswick's principal trademarks: Marine Engine Segment:  Attwood, Axius, Diversified Marine Products, Kellogg Marine Supply, Land 'N' Sea, Mariner, MercNET, MerCruiser, Mercury, Mercury Marine, Mercury Parts Express, Mercury Precision Parts, Mercury Propellers, Mercury Racing, MotorGuide, OptiMax, Quicksilver, Seachoice, SeaPro, SmartCraft, Sport Jet, Swivl-Eze, Valiant, Verado and Zeus.Boat Segment:  Aquapalooza, Bayliner, Boston Whaler, Crestliner, Cypress Cay, FloteBote, Harris, Lowe, Lund, Master Dealer, Meridian, Princecraft, Quicksilver, Rayglass, Sea Ray and Uttern.Fitness Segment:  Flex Deck, Hammer Strength, Lifecycle and Life Fitness.Bowling & Billiards Segment:  Air Hockey, Ballworx, Brunswick, Brunswick Pavilion, Brunswick Zone, Brunswick Zone XL, Centennial, Contender, Cosmic Bowling, Frameworx, Gold Crown, Lightworx, Pro Lane, Vector, Viz-A-Ball and Zone.Brunswick's trademark rights have indefinite lives, and many are well known to the public and are considered to be valuable assets.Competitive Conditions and PositionThe Company believes that it has a reputation for quality in each of its highly competitive lines of business. Brunswick competes in its various markets by: utilizing efficient production techniques; developing and strengthening its leading brands; developing and promoting innovative technological advancements; undertaking effective marketing, advertising and sales efforts; providing high-quality products at competitive prices; and offering extensive aftermarket services. Strong competition exists in each of Brunswick's product groups, but no single enterprise competes with Brunswick in all 6product groups. In each product area, competitors range in size from large, highly-diversified companies to small, single-product businesses. Brunswick also competes with businesses that offer alternative leisure products or activities, but do not compete directly with Brunswick's products. The following summarizes Brunswick's competitive position in each segment: Marine Engine Segment:  The Company believes it has the largest dollar sales and unit volume of recreational marine engines in the world, along with a leading marine parts and accessories business. The marine engine market is highly competitive among several major international companies that comprise the majority of the market, as well as several smaller companies. Competitive advantage in this segment is a function of product features, technological leadership, quality, service, pricing, performance and durability, along with effective promotion and distribution. Boat Segment:  The Company believes it has the largest dollar sales and unit volume of pleasure motorboats in the world. There are several major manufacturers of pleasure and offshore fishing boats, along with hundreds of smaller manufacturers. Consequently, this business is both highly competitive and highly fragmented. The Company believes it has the broadest range of boat product offerings in the world, with boats ranging in size from 10 to 61 feet. In all of its boat operations, Brunswick competes on the basis of product features, technology, quality, dealer service, pricing, performance, value, durability and styling, along with effective promotion and distribution. Fitness Segment:  The Company believes it is the world's largest manufacturer of commercial fitness equipment and a leading manufacturer of high-quality consumer fitness equipment. There are a few large manufacturers of fitness equipment and hundreds of small manufacturers, which creates a highly fragmented, competitive landscape. Many of Brunswick's fitness equipment offerings feature industry-leading product innovations, and the Company places significant emphasis on introducing new fitness equipment to the market. Competitive focus is also placed on product quality, technology, service, pricing, state-of-the-art biomechanics, and effective promotional activities. Bowling & Billiards Segment:  The Company believes it is a leading worldwide full-line designer, manufacturer and marketer of bowling products and billiards tables. There are other manufacturers of bowling products and competitive emphasis is placed on product innovation, quality, service, marketing activities and pricing. The billiards industry continues to experience competitive pressure from low-cost billiards manufacturers outside the United States. The bowling retail market, in which the Company's bowling centers compete, is highly fragmented. Brunswick is one of the two largest bowling center operators in the North American market, with Brunswick's bowling retail business emphasizing the bowling and entertainment experience, maintaining quality facilities and providing excellent guest service.  Research and DevelopmentThe Company strives to improve its competitive position in all of its segments by continuously investing in research and development to drive innovation in its products and manufacturing technologies. Brunswick's research and development investments support the introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products. Research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were 2.8 percent, 2.6 percent and 2.7 percent in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.  Research and development expenses by segment are shown below:            (in millions)2012 2011 2010Marine Engine$61.5 $56.7 $51.7Boat20.2 17.5 18.1Fitness19.2 17.6 16.7Bowling & Billiards4.4 4.1 3.8Total$105.3 $95.9 $90.37Number of EmployeesThe number of employees worldwide (including those in businesses treated as discontinued operations) is shown below by segment:     December 31, 2012 December 31, 2011 Total Union (domestic) Total Union (domestic)Marine Engine5,202 1,814 4,684 1,396Boat4,393 — 4,125 —Fitness1,804 140 1,756 138Bowling & Billiards4,625 22 4,632 24Corporate153 — 159 —Total16,177 1,976 15,356 1,558The Company believes that the relationships between its employees, the labor unions and the Company remain stable. Environmental RequirementsRefer to Note 12 – Commitments and Contingencies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of certain environmental proceedings.Available InformationBrunswick maintains an Internet Web site at http://www.brunswick.com that includes links to Brunswick's Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports (SEC Reports).

The Company's operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, which could adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of the Company's common stock. Worldwide economic conditions, particularly in the United States and Europe, have adversely affected the Company's industries, businesses and results of operations and may continue to do so. General worldwide economic conditions, particularly in the United States and Europe, continue to be challenging as economies begin to recover from the effects caused by the subprime lending crisis, general credit market crisis, collateral effects on the finance and banking industries, increased energy costs, concerns about inflation, slower economic activity, decreased consumer confidence, reduced corporate profits and capital spending, adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns.  In times of economic uncertainty and contraction, consumers tend to have less discretionary income and to defer expenditures for discretionary items, which adversely affects the Company's financial performance, especially in its marine businesses.  A majority of the Company's businesses are cyclical in nature and are highly sensitive to personal discretionary spending levels, and their success is dependent upon favorable economic conditions, the overall level of consumer confidence and personal income levels. Other factors that can negatively affect the Company's financial results include: the impact of weak consumer and corporate credit markets; depressed marine industry demand; corporate restructurings; declines in the value of investments and residential real estate, especially in large boating markets such as Florida and California; and higher fuel prices. Demand for the Company's marine products has been significantly influenced by weak economic conditions, low consumer confidence, high unemployment and increased market volatility worldwide, especially in the United States and Europe.  Although increases have not been experienced in all product segments and geographic markets, and the Company estimates that retail unit sales of powerboats in the United States increased modestly during 2012, unit sales remain down significantly from historical levels, particularly in the fiberglass segment. Any deterioration in general economic conditions that further diminishes consumer confidence or discretionary income may further reduce the Company's sales and adversely affect its financial results, including increasing the potential for future impairment charges.  The Company cannot predict the timing or strength of economic recovery, either worldwide or in the specific markets where it competes. Fiscal concerns in the United States and Europe, including the downgrade of the U.S. government's credit rating, may negatively impact the worldwide economy, and could have an adverse effect on the Company's industries, businesses and financial condition. Concerns regarding the U.S. debt ceiling and budget deficit, as well as the European debt crisis, could have an adverse effect on worldwide economic conditions. These concerns also include the potential impact of additional credit agency downgrades.  Such fiscal concerns and the resulting downgrade of the U.S. government's credit rating could have a material adverse impact on worldwide economic conditions, the financial markets and the availability of credit and, consequently, may negatively affect the Company's industries, businesses and overall financial condition.Although consumer credit markets have improved, consumer credit market conditions continue to influence demand, especially for marine products, and may continue to do so. Customers often finance purchases of the Company's marine products, particularly boats. Credit market conditions continued to improve in 2012, but remained less favorable overall than those experienced prior to the decline in marine retail demand. While interest rates are generally lower, there continue to be fewer lenders, tighter underwriting and loan approval criteria and greater down payment requirements.  If credit conditions worsen, and adversely affect the ability of customers to finance potential purchases at acceptable terms and interest rates, it could result in a decrease in sales of the Company's products or delay any improvement in its sales. The inability of the Company's dealers and distributors to secure adequate access to capital could adversely affect the Company's sales. The Company's dealers require adequate liquidity to finance their operations, including purchases of the Company's products.  Dealers are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could unfavorably affect their liquidity positions, including, among other things, continued access to adequate financing sources on a timely basis on reasonable terms.  These sources of financing are vital to the Company's ability to sell products through the Company's distribution network, particularly to its boat and engine dealers.  During the credit crisis which ensued during and after the 2009 recession, several third-party floorplan lenders ceased their lending operations or materially reduced their exposure.  A significant portion of the Company's domestic and 9international boat and engine sales to dealers are financed through entities affiliated with GE  Capital Corporation (GECC), including BAC (the Company's 49 percent owned joint venture, with the other 51 percent being owned by CDFV, a subsidiary of GECC),  which provides floorplan financing to domestic marine dealers. The availability and terms of financing offered by the Company's dealer floorplan financing providers will continue to be influenced by: their ability to access certain capital markets, including the securitization and the commercial paper markets, and to fund their operations in a cost effective manner; the performance of their overall credit portfolios; their willingness to accept the risks associated with lending to marine dealers; and the overall creditworthiness of those dealers.  The Company's sales could be adversely affected if BAC were to be terminated, if further declines in floorplan financing availability occur, or if financing terms change unfavorably.  This could require the Company to find alternative sources of financing, including the Company providing this financing directly to dealers, which could require additional capital to fund the associated receivables. The Company's financial results may be adversely affected if it is unable to maintain effective distribution. The Company relies on third-party dealers and distributors to sell the majority of its products, particularly in the marine business.  The ability to maintain a reliable network of dealers is essential to the Company's success.  The Company faces competition from other boat manufacturers in attracting and retaining distributors and independent boat dealers. A significant deterioration in the number or effectiveness of the Company's dealers and distributors could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial results.  Weakening demand for marine products could adversely affect the financial performance of the Company's dealers.  In particular, reduced cash flow from decreases in sales and tightening credit markets may impair a dealer's ability to fund operations.  Inability to fund operations can force dealers to cease business, and the Company may not be able to obtain alternate distribution in the vacated market. An inability to obtain alternate distribution could unfavorably affect the Company's net sales through reduced market presence. If conditions were to worsen, the Company anticipates that dealer failures or voluntary market exits could increase, especially if overall retail demand for boats declines.  Adverse economic, credit and capital market conditions could have a negative impact on the Company's financial results. The Company does not frequently rely on short-term capital markets to meet its working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, pay dividends, or fund employee benefit programs; however, the Company does maintain short-term borrowing facilities which can be used to meet these capital requirements.  In addition, over the long term, the Company may determine that it is necessary to access the capital markets to refinance existing long-term indebtedness or for other initiatives. Adverse global economic conditions, market volatility and heightened governmental regulation could lead to volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets.  This could adversely affect the Company's ability to access capital and credit markets or increase the cost to do so, which could have a negative impact on its business, financial results and competitive position. Inventory reductions by major dealers, retailers and independent boat builders could adversely affect the Company's financial results. The Company's dealers, retailers and other distributors could decide to reduce the number of units they hold, especially in the large fiberglass boat segment.  Such efforts would likely result in lower production levels of the Company's products, thus resulting in lower rates of absorption of fixed costs in the Company's manufacturing facilities and lower margins. While actions taken continue to keep dealer inventories at appropriate levels, the potential need for future inventory reductions by dealers and independent boatbuilder customers could impair the Company's future sales and results of operations. The Company may be required to repurchase inventory or accounts of certain dealers. The Company has agreements with certain third-party finance companies to provide financing to the Company's customers to enable the purchase of its products.  In connection with these agreements, the Company either may have obligations to repurchase the Company's products from the finance company, or may have recourse obligations to the finance company on the dealer's receivables.  These obligations are triggered if the Company's dealers default on their debt obligations to the finance companies. The Company's maximum contingent obligation to repurchase inventory and its maximum contingent recourse obligations on customer receivables are less than the total balances of dealer financings outstanding under these programs, as the Company's obligations under certain of these arrangements are subject to caps, or are limited based on the age of product.  The Company's risk related to these arrangements is mitigated by the proceeds it receives on the resale of repurchased product to other dealers, or by recoveries on receivables purchased under the recourse obligations.10The Company's inventory repurchase obligations relate primarily to the inventory floorplan credit facilities of the Company's boat and engine dealers. The Company's actual historical repurchase experience related to these repurchase arrangements has been substantially less than the Company's maximum contractual obligations. If dealers file for bankruptcy or cease operations, losses associated with the repurchase of the Company's products could be incurred.  In addition, as the repurchases may be triggered by dealer bankruptcies, the Company's net sales and earnings may be unfavorably affected as a result of reduced market coverage and the associated decline in sales. Declines in marine industry demand could cause an increase in future repurchase activity, or could require the Company to incur losses in excess of established reserves.  In addition, the Company's cash flow and loss experience could be adversely affected if repurchased inventory is not successfully distributed to other dealers in a timely manner, or if the recovery rate on the resale of the product declines.  In addition, the finance companies could require changes in repurchase or recourse terms that would result in an increase in the Company's contractual contingent obligations.  The loss of key accounts or critical suppliers could harm the Company's business. If the Company were to experience the loss of a key account, its business could be negatively affected in a significant way.  Similarly, if one of the Company's most critical suppliers were to close its operations, cease manufacturing or otherwise fail to deliver an essential component necessary to the Company's manufacturing operations, it could have a detrimental effect on the Company's ability to manufacture and sell its products, resulting in an interruption in business operations and/or a loss of sales.  In an effort to mitigate the risk associated with the Company's reliance on such accounts and suppliers, it continually works to monitor such relationships, maintain a complete and competitive product lineup and identify alternative suppliers for key components. The Company's success depends upon the continued strength of its brands. The Company believes that its brands, including Brunswick, Mercury, Sea Ray, Boston Whaler and Life Fitness, are significant contributors to the success of the Company's business and that maintaining and enhancing the brands are important to expanding the Company's customer base.  Failure to continue to promote and protect the Company's brands may adversely affect the Company's business and results of operations. The Company has a large fixed cost base that can affect its profitability in a declining sales environment. The fixed cost levels of operating marine production plants can put pressure on profit margins when sales and production decline. The Company's profitability is dependent, in part, on its ability to spread fixed costs over an increasing number of products sold and shipped, and if the Company makes a decision to reduce its rate of production, gross margins could be negatively affected. Consequently, decreased demand or the need to reduce inventories can lower the Company's ability to absorb fixed costs and materially impact its results of operations. Successfully managing its manufacturing footprint is critical to the Company's operating and financial results. A significant component of the Company's cost-reduction efforts has been a focus on reducing its manufacturing footprint by consolidating boat and engine production into fewer plants.  In the second quarter of 2012, the Company completed the consolidation of engine production by transferring sterndrive engine manufacturing operations from its Stillwater, Oklahoma plant to its Fond du Lac, Wisconsin plant.  In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company began the consolidation of its Knoxville, Tennessee boat plant operation into its manufacturing facilities in Vonore, Tennessee and Palm Coast, Florida.  This transition is expected to conclude in 2013. Moving production to a different plant involves risks, including the inability to start up production within the cost and timeframe estimated, supply product to customers when expected and attract a sufficient number of skilled workers to handle the additional production demands.  The inability to successfully implement the Company's manufacturing footprint initiatives could adversely affect its ability to meet customer demand for products and could increase the cost of production versus projections, both of which could result in a significant adverse impact on operating and financial results. Additionally, expenses associated with plant consolidation, including severance costs and loss of trained employees with knowledge of the Company's business and operations, could exceed projections and negatively impact financial results.To successfully manage its manufacturing footprint, the Company also must enable growth through strategic capital investments including facility and capacity expansion projects.  These capital improvement projects and expansions must be carefully managed  to ensure cost targets are met, environmental, safety and other regulations are followed and high-quality workmanship is maintained. 11If the Company is not able to successfully implement its restructuring and growth initiatives, this could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business and financial condition. The Company's ability to successfully generate cash flow will depend on its continued successful execution of the Company's restructuring and growth initiatives.  Demand for certain of the Company's marine products continues at historically low levels, mainly as a result of a deterioration in economic conditions. As a result, the Company has taken, and may in the future take additional global restructuring activities to realign its cost structure with existing demand. The occurrence of restructuring activities could result in impairment charges and other expenses, which could adversely impact the Company's cash flow, results of operations or financial condition.The Company relies on third-party suppliers for the supply of the raw materials, parts and components necessary to manufacture its products.  The Company's financial results may be adversely affected by an increase in cost, disruption of supply or shortage of or defect in raw materials, parts or product components. Outside suppliers and contract manufacturers provide the Company with raw materials used in its manufacturing processes including oil, aluminum, copper, steel and resins, as well as product parts and components, such as engine blocks and boat windshields.  The prices for these raw materials, parts and components fluctuate depending on market conditions and in some instances, commodity prices.  Substantial increases in the prices of the Company's raw materials, parts and components would increase the Company's operating costs, and could reduce its profitability if the Company cannot recoup the increased costs through increased product prices.  In addition, some components used in the Company's manufacturing processes, including engine blocks and boat windshields, are available from a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers.  Operational and financial difficulties that these or other suppliers may face in the future could adversely affect their ability to supply the Company with the parts and components it needs, which could significantly disrupt the Company's operations.  It may be difficult to find a replacement supplier for a limited or sole source raw material, part or component without significant delay or on commercially reasonable terms.  In addition, an uncorrected defect or supplier's variation in a raw material, part or component, either unknown to the Company or incompatible with the Company's manufacturing process, could harm the Company's ability to manufacture products.  Some of the risks that could disrupt the Company's operations, impair the Company's ability to deliver products to the Company's customers and negatively affect the Company's financial results include: an increase in the cost of, defects in or a sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of some of these raw materials, parts or products that may be caused by delayed start-up periods experienced by the Company's suppliers as they increase production efforts; financial pressures on the Company's suppliers due to a weakening economy; and a deterioration of the Company's relationships with suppliers or by events such as natural disasters, power outages or labor strikes. In addition to the risks described above regarding interruption of supplies, which are exacerbated in the case of single-source suppliers, the exclusive supplier of a key component potentially could exert significant bargaining power over price, quality, warranty claims, or other terms relating to a component. The Company's manufacturing operations increased production in 2012 and are expected continue to do so in 2013, and consequently, the Company's need for raw materials and supplies will increase. The Company's suppliers must be prepared to ramp up operations and, in many cases, hire additional workers and/or expand capacity in order to fulfill the orders placed by the Company and other customers. The Company experienced periodic supply shortages in 2010, 2011 and 2012.  The Company continues to work to address this issue by identifying alternative suppliers, working to secure adequate inventories of critical supplies and continually monitoring the capabilities of its supplier base. In the future, however, the Company may continue to experience shortages of, delayed delivery of and/or increased prices for key materials, parts and supplies that are essential to its manufacturing operations. The Company's pension funding requirements and expenses are affected by certain factors outside its control, including the performance of plan assets, the discount rate used to value liabilities, actuarial data and experience and legal and regulatory changes. The Company's funding obligations and pension expense for its four qualified pension plans are driven by the performance of assets set aside in trusts for these plans, the discount rate used to value the plans' liabilities, actuarial data and experience and legal and regulatory funding requirements.  Changes in these factors could have an adverse impact on the Company's results of operations, liquidity or shareholders' equity.  In addition, a portion of the Company's pension plan assets are invested in equity securities, which can experience significant declines if financial markets weaken.  The level of the Company's funding of its qualified pension plan liabilities was approximately 67 percent as of December 31, 2012. The Company's future pension expenses and funding requirements could increase significantly due to the effect of adverse changes in the discount rate and asset levels along with a decline in the estimated return on plan assets. In addition, as a result of changes in regulations, the Company could be legally 12required to make increased contributions to the pension plans, and these contributions could be material and negatively affect the Company's cash flow. Higher energy and fuel costs can adversely affect the Company's results. Higher energy and fuel costs result in increases in operating expenses at the Company's manufacturing facilities and in the cost of shipping products to customers.  In addition, increases in energy costs can adversely affect the pricing and availability of petroleum-based raw materials such as resins and foam that are used in many of the Company's marine products.  Also, higher fuel prices may have an adverse effect on demand for marine retail products as they increase the cost of boat ownership, and may have a negative impact on operating margins, particularly in the Fitness segment, as transportation costs increase.  Finally, because heating and air conditioning comprise a significant part of the cost of operating a bowling center, any increase in the price of energy could adversely affect the operating margins of the Company's bowling centers. The Company's profitability may suffer as a result of competitive pricing and other pressures. The introduction of lower-priced alternative products by other companies can hurt the Company's competitive position in all of its businesses.  The Company is constantly subject to competitive pressures, particularly in the outboard engine market, in which predominantly Asian manufacturers often have pursued a strategy of aggressive pricing particularly during periods when the Japanese yen weakens versus the U.S. dollar.  Such pricing pressure may limit the Company's ability to increase prices for its products in response to raw material and other cost increases and negatively affect the Company's profit margins. In addition, the Company's independent boat builder customers may react negatively to potential competition for their products from Brunswick's own boat brands, which can lead them to purchase marine engines and marine engine supplies from competing marine engine manufacturers and may negatively affect demand for the Company's products. The Company's ability to remain competitive depends on the successful introduction of new product offerings and the ability to meet its customers' expectations. The Company believes that its customers rigorously evaluate their suppliers on the basis of product quality along with new product innovation and development capability. The Company's ability to remain competitive may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development, such as an inability to develop viable new products, gain market acceptance of new products, generate sufficient capital to fund new product development or obtain adequate intellectual property protection for new products. To meet ever-changing consumer demands, the timing of market entry and pricing of new products are critical.  As a result, the Company may not be able to introduce new products necessary to remain competitive in all markets that it serves.  Furthermore, the Company must deliver quality products that meet or exceed its customers' expectations regarding product quality and after-sales service. The Company competes with a variety of other activities for consumers' scarce discretionary income and leisure time. The vast majority of the Company's products are used for recreational purposes, and demand for the Company's products can be adversely affected by competition from other activities that occupy consumers' time, including other forms of recreation as well as religious, cultural and community activities. Additionally, the decrease in consumers' discretionary income as a result of the recent economic environment has influenced consumers' willingness to purchase and enjoy the Company's products. The Company manufactures and sells products that create exposure to potential product liability, warranty liability, personal injury and property damage claims and litigation. The Company's products may expose it to potential product liability, warranty liability, personal injury or property damage claims relating to the use of those products. The Company's manufacturing consolidation efforts and production of new products could result in product quality issues, thereby increasing the risk of litigation and potential liability. To address this risk, the Company has established a global, enterprise-wide organization charged with the responsibility of reviewing and addressing product quality issues.  Historically, the resolution of such claims has not materially adversely affected the Company's business, and the Company maintains insurance coverage to mitigate a portion of these risks, which it believes to be adequate.  However, the Company may experience material losses in the future, incur significant costs to defend claims or experience claims in excess of its insurance coverage or claims that will not be covered by insurance.  Furthermore, the Company's reputation may be adversely affected by such claims, whether or not successful, including potential negative publicity about its products. The Company records reserves for known potential liabilities, but there is the possibility that actual losses may exceed these reserves and therefore negatively impact earnings. 13Environmental laws and zoning and other requirements can inhibit the Company's ability to grow its marine businesses. Environmental restrictions, boat plant emission restrictions and permitting and zoning requirements can limit access to water for boating, as well as marina and storage space.  In addition, certain jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States require or are considering requiring a license to operate a recreational boat.  While such licensing requirements are not expected to be unduly restrictive, they may deter potential customers, thereby reducing the Company's sales.  Furthermore, regulations allowing the sale of fuel containing higher levels of ethanol for automobiles, which is not approved or intended for use in marine engines, may nonetheless result in increased warranty, service and other claims against the Company if boaters mistakenly use this fuel in marine engines, causing damage to and the degradation of components in their marine engines. Compliance with environmental regulations affecting marine engines will increase costs and may reduce demand for the Company's products. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's emission regulations require certain gasoline sterndrive and inboard engines to be equipped with a catalyst exhaust monitoring and treatment system.  It is possible that environmental regulatory bodies may impose higher emissions standards in the future for marine engines.  Compliance with these standards would increase the cost to manufacture and the price to the customer for the Company's engines, which could in turn reduce consumer demand for the Company's marine products and potentially reduce operating margins. An increase in the cost of marine engines, an increase in the retail price to consumers or unforeseen delays in compliance with environmental regulations affecting these products could have an adverse effect on the Company's results of operations.The Company's businesses may be adversely affected by compliance obligations and liabilities under various laws and regulations. The Company is subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including product safety, environmental, health and safety laws and other regulations.  While the Company believes that it maintains all requisite licenses and permits and that it is in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, a failure to satisfy these and other regulatory requirements could cause the Company to incur fines or penalties, and compliance could increase its cost of operations.  The adoption of additional laws, rules and regulations could also increase the Company's capital or operating costs. The Company's manufacturing processes involve the use, handling, storage and contracting for recycling or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes.  Accordingly, the Company is subject to regulations regarding these substances, and the misuse or mishandling of such substances could expose it to liabilities, including claims for property or natural resources damages or personal injury, or fines.  The Company is also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property.  If a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from any of the Company's current or former properties or another location where it has disposed of hazardous materials, the Company may be held liable for the contamination, regardless of knowledge or whether it was at fault in connection with the release, and the amount of such liability could be material. Additionally, the Company is subject to laws governing its relationship with its employees, including, but not limited to, employee wage, hour and benefit issues, such as pension funding and health care benefits.  Changes to such legislation could increase the cost of the Company's operations. Specifically, the effects of The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, once ultimately determined and implemented, may have an adverse effect on the financial operations of the Company, primarily in the bowling retail business.Increases in income tax rates or changes in income tax laws or enforcement could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial results.Changes in domestic and international tax legislation could expose the Company to additional tax liability.  Although the Company carefully monitors changes in tax laws and works to mitigate the impact of proposed changes, such changes may negatively impact the Company's financial results.  In addition, any increase in individual income tax rates, such as those implemented at the beginning of 2013, would negatively affect the Company's potential customers' discretionary income and could decrease the demand for its products.  Finally, governments in certain foreign jurisdictions are increasing their audit activity in an effort to obtain additional funds.  This increased audit activity involves increased costs to the Company to determine the final outcome and the potential for additional taxes to be assessed.14If the Company's intellectual property protection is inadequate, others may be able to use its technologies and thereby reduce the Company's ability to compete, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company, its financial condition and results of operations. The Company regards much of the technology underlying its products as proprietary.  The steps the Company takes to protect its proprietary technology may be inadequate to prevent misappropriation of the Company's technology, or third parties may independently develop similar technology.  The Company relies on a combination of patents, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws; employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements; and other contracts to establish and protect its technology and other intellectual property rights.  The agreements may be breached or terminated, the Company may not have adequate remedies for any such breach, and existing patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws afford it limited protection.  Policing unauthorized use of the Company's intellectual property is difficult, particularly in many regions outside the United States.  A third party could copy or otherwise obtain and use the Company's products or technology without authorization. Litigation may be necessary for the Company to defend against claims of infringement or to protect its intellectual property rights and could result in substantial cost.  Further, the Company might not prevail in such litigation, which could harm its business. Some of the Company's operations are conducted by joint ventures that are not operated solely for its benefit. Some of the Company's operations are carried on through jointly owned companies such as BAC and Tohatsu Marine Corporation.  With respect to these joint ventures, the Company shares ownership and management responsibility of these companies with one or more parties who may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities or resources as the Company.  These joint ventures are intended to be operated for the equal benefit of all co-owners, rather than for the Company's exclusive benefit.  Changes in currency exchange rates can adversely affect the Company's results. The Company derives a portion of its revenues from outside the United States (38 percent in 2012).  The Company manufactures its products primarily in the United States and the costs of the Company's products are generally denominated in U.S. dollars, although the increase in manufacturing and sourcing of products and materials outside the United States continues to be a strategic focus.  The Company sells a significant portion of these products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.  Consequently, a strong U.S. dollar can make the Company's products less price-competitive relative to products manufactured outside the United States, and can adversely affect its financial performance. Although the Company enters into currency exchange contracts to reduce its risk related to currency exchange fluctuations, it is impossible to hedge against all currency risk, especially over the long term, and changes in the relative values of currencies may occur from time to time and, in some instances, affect the Company's results of operations.  The Company is also exposed to the risk that its counterparties to hedging contracts could default on their obligations, which may have an adverse effect on the Company. A growing portion of the Company's revenue may be derived from international sources, which exposes it to additional uncertainty. Approximately 38 percent of the Company's 2012 sales were derived from sources outside the United States and the Company intends to continue to expand its international operations and customer base as part of its growth strategy.  Sales outside the United States, especially in emerging markets, are subject to various risks including government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions, tariffs, fuel duties, inflation, difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems, compliance with international laws, treaties and regulations and unexpected changes in regulatory environments, disruptions in distribution, dependence on foreign personnel and unions, as well as economic and social instability.  In addition, there may be tax inefficiencies in repatriating cash from non-U.S. subsidiaries.  If the Company continues to expand its business globally, its success will depend, in part, on the Company's ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks.  These and other factors may have a material impact on the Company's international operations or its business as a whole. An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill, trade names and other long-lived assets could negatively affect the Company's consolidated results of operations and net worth. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as the Company's trade names, are recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition and are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise.  In evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill and trade names, the Company makes assumptions regarding future operating performance, business trends and market and economic conditions.  Such analyses further require the Company to make certain assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates.  There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and in applying these factors to the assessment of goodwill and trade name recoverability.  Goodwill reviews are 15prepared using estimates of the fair value of reporting units based on the estimated present value of future discounted cash flows.  The Company could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill or trade names prior to the annual assessment if it experiences disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, a divestiture of a significant component of the Company's business or market capitalization declines. The Company also continually evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of its definite-lived intangible assets, excluding goodwill, and other long-lived assets may warrant revision or whether the remaining balance of such assets may not be recoverable.  The Company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flow over the remaining life of the asset in measuring whether the asset is recoverable. If the future operating performance of the Company's reporting units is not consistent with the Company's assumptions, the Company could be required to record non-cash impairment charges.  Impairment charges could substantially affect the Company's reported earnings in the periods such charges are recorded.  In addition, impairment charges could indicate a reduction in business value which could limit the Company's ability to obtain adequate financing in the future.  As of December 31, 2012, goodwill was approximately 12 percent of total assets and included $270.6 million of goodwill related to the Life Fitness segment and $21.1 million of goodwill related to the Marine Engine segment. Adverse weather conditions can have a negative effect on marine and retail bowling center revenues. Weather conditions can have a significant effect on the Company's operating and financial results, especially in the marine and retail bowling center businesses.  Sales of the Company's marine products are generally stronger just before and during spring and summer, and favorable weather during these months generally has a positive effect on consumer demand.  Conversely, unseasonably cool weather, excessive rainfall or drought conditions during these periods can reduce demand.  Hurricanes and other storms can result in the disruption of the Company's distribution channel. In addition, severely inclement weather on weekends and holidays, particularly during the winter months, can adversely affect patronage of the Company's bowling centers and, therefore, revenues in the retail bowling center business. Additionally, in the event that climate change occurs, which could result in environmental changes including, but not limited to, severe weather, rising sea levels or reduced access to water, the Company's business could be disrupted and negatively affected. Instability in locations where the Company maintains a significant presence could adversely impact the Company's business operations. The Company has established a global presence, with manufacturing, sales, distribution and retail locations around the world.  Changing conditions in those locations, including, but not limited to, political instability, civil unrest and an increase in criminal activity, could have a negative impact on the Company's local manufacturing and other business operations.  Decreased stability in those regions where the Company conducts business poses a risk of business interruption and delays in shipments of materials, components and finished goods, as well as a risk of decreased local retail demand for the Company's products in those regions. Catastrophic events, including natural and environmental disasters, could have a negative effect on the Company's operations and financial results. The occurrence of natural and environmental disasters, including hurricanes, floods, earthquakes and environmental spills, could decrease consumer demand for and sales of the Company's products.  If such an occurrence takes place in one of Brunswick's major sales markets, the Company could experience a decrease in sales.  Additionally, if such an event occurs near the Company's business, manufacturing facilities or key suppliers' facilities, the affected locations could experience an interruption in business operations and/or their operating systems. The Company's operations are dependent upon the services of key individuals, the loss of whom may have an adverse effect. The Company's operations depend, in part, on the efforts of the Company's executive officers and other key employees.  In addition, the Company's future success will depend on, among other factors, its ability to attract and retain other qualified personnel. The loss of the services of any of the Company's key employees or the failure to attract or retain employees could have an adverse effect on the Company.  The Company's restructuring activities, which have resulted in substantial employee terminations, may make it more difficult for the Company to attract or retain employees and it may be adversely affected for some time by the loss of trained employees with knowledge of the Company's business and industries.  If the Company is unable to attract and retain qualified individuals, or the Company's costs to do so increase significantly, the Company's operations could be adversely affected. 16The Company's business operations could be negatively impacted by the failure of its information technology systems.     The Company's global business operations are managed through a variety of information technology (IT) systems.  These systems govern all aspects of the company's operations around the world.  The Company is dependent on these systems for all commercial transactions, customer interactions, and image projection.  Some of the systems are based on legacy technology and operate with a minimal level of available support.  If one of these legacy systems or another of the Company's key IT systems were to suffer a failure, or if the Company's IT systems were unable to communicate effectively, this could result in missed or delayed sales, or lost opportunities for cost reduction or efficient cash management.  The Company exchanges information with hundreds of trading partners across all aspects of it's commercial operations.  Any breach in security or disruption of the communications could result in erroneous transactions or loss of reputation and confidence.  The company has numerous portals to engage in e-commerce and e-marketing; therefore, the company must remain diligent in protecting itself from malicious cyber attacks.  A successful cyber attack could result in a disruption of services, fraudulent transactions, or disclosure of confidential information.  This could negatively affect the Company's relationships with its trading partners and damage its image and reputation"
6,BC,BRUNSWICK CORP,2012-02-23,"Risk Factors
The Company’s operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of the Company’s common stock. Worldwide economic conditions, particularly in the United States and Europe, have adversely affected the Company’s industries, businesses and results of operations and may continue to do so. In 2008, general worldwide economic conditions, particularly in the United States and Europe, experienced a downturn due to the effects of the subprime lending crisis, general credit market crisis, collateral effects on the finance and banking industries, increased energy costs, concerns about inflation, slower economic activity, decreased consumer confidence, reduced corporate profits and capital spending, adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns.  In times of economic uncertainty and contraction, consumers tend to have less discretionary income and to defer expenditures for discretionary items, which adversely affects the Company’s financial performance, especially in its marine businesses.  A majority of the Company’s businesses are cyclical in nature and are highly sensitive to personal discretionary spending levels, and their success is dependent upon favorable economic conditions, the overall level of consumer confidence and personal income levels. Other factors negatively affecting the Company’s financial results, which may continue to do so, include: the impact of weak consumer and corporate credit markets; depressed marine industry demand; corporate restructurings; declines in the value of investments and residential real estate, especially in large boating markets such as Florida and California; and higher fuel prices. Demand for the Company’s marine products has been significantly influenced by weak economic conditions, low consumer confidence, high unemployment and increased market volatility worldwide, especially in the United States and Europe.  The Company estimates that retail unit sales of powerboats in the United States were relatively flat during 2011 and down significantly from historical highs. Any deterioration in general economic conditions that further diminishes consumer confidence or discretionary income may further reduce the Company’s sales and adversely affect its financial results, including increasing the potential for future impairment charges.  The Company cannot predict the timing or strength of economic recovery, either worldwide or in the specific markets where it competes. Fiscal concerns in the United States and Europe, including the downgrade of the U.S. government’s credit rating, may negatively impact the worldwide economy, and could have an adverse effect on the Company’s industries, businesses and financial condition. Concerns regarding the U.S. debt ceiling and budget deficit, as well as the European debt crisis, could have an adverse effect on worldwide economic conditions. These concerns also include the potential impact of credit agency downgrades, including Standard & Poor’s decision to downgrade the U.S. government’s credit rating from AAA to AA+ in August 2011, and the possibility that other credit-rating agencies could similarly elect to downgrade the U.S. government’s credit rating.  Such fiscal concerns and the resulting downgrade of the U.S. government’s credit rating could have a material adverse impact on worldwide economic conditions, the financial markets and the availability of credit and, consequently, may negatively affect the Company’s industries, businesses and overall financial condition.  12  Although consumer credit markets have improved, tight consumer credit markets continue to influence demand, especially for marine products, and may continue to do so. Customers often finance purchases of the Company’s marine products, particularly boats. Credit market conditions improved during 2011, but remained less favorable overall than those experienced prior to the decline in marine retail demand. While interest rates are generally lower, there continues to be fewer lenders, tighter underwriting and loan approval criteria and greater down payment requirements.  If credit conditions worsen, and adversely affect the ability of customers to finance potential purchases at acceptable terms and interest rates, it could result in a decrease in sales of the Company’s products or delay any improvement in its sales. The inability of the Company’s dealers and distributors to secure adequate access to capital could adversely affect the Company’s sales. The Company’s dealers require adequate liquidity to finance their operations, including purchases of the Company’s products.  Dealers are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could unfavorably affect their liquidity positions, including, among other things, continued access to adequate financing sources on a timely basis on reasonable terms.  These sources of financing are vital to the Company’s ability to sell products through the Company’s distribution network, particularly to its boat and engine dealers.  During the recent credit crisis, several third-party floorplan lenders ceased their lending operations or materially reduced their exposure.  A significant portion of the Company’s domestic and international boat and engine sales to dealers are financed through entities affiliated with GE  Capital Corporation (GECC), including BAC (the Company’s 49 percent owned joint venture, with the other 51 percent being owned by CDFV, a subsidiary of GECC),  which provides floorplan financing to domestic marine dealers. The availability and terms of financing offered by the Company’s dealer floorplan financing providers will continue to be influenced by: their ability to access certain capital markets, including the securitization and the commercial paper markets, and to fund their operations in a cost effective manner; the performance of their overall credit portfolios; their willingness to accept the risks associated with lending to marine dealers; and the overall creditworthiness of those dealers.  The Company’s sales could be adversely affected if BAC were to be terminated, if further declines in floorplan financing availability occur, or if financing terms become more adverse.  This could require the Company to find alternative sources of financing, including the Company providing this financing directly to dealers, which could require additional capital to fund the associated receivables. The Company’s financial results may be adversely affected if it is unable to maintain effective distribution. The Company relies on third-party dealers and distributors to sell the majority of its products, particularly in the marine business.  The ability to maintain a reliable network of dealers is essential to the Company’s success.  The Company faces competition from other boat manufacturers in attracting and retaining distributors and independent boat dealers. A significant deterioration in the number or effectiveness of the Company’s dealers and distributors could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial results.  Weak demand for marine products has adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect the financial performance of the Company’s dealers.  In particular, reduced cash flow from additional decreases in sales and tighter credit markets may impair a dealer’s ability to fund operations.  Inability to fund operations can force dealers to cease business, and the Company may not be able to obtain alternate distribution in the vacated market. An inability to obtain alternate distribution could unfavorably affect the Company’s net sales through lower market exposure. If conditions worsen, the Company anticipates that dealer failures or voluntary market exits could increase in future periods, especially if overall retail demand for boats declines.     13   The Company’s financial results may be adversely affected due to the dissolution of the CMD joint venture.During the fourth quarter of 2011, the Company announced that Mercury Marine and Cummins would dissolve the CMD joint venture and enter into a strategic supply agreement between the two companies.  As part of the transition, CMD’s high speed diesel line will be integrated into Mercury Marine’s product portfolio and it will sell, service and support these products through its global sales and distribution network.  Although the Company is prepared for the transition and will continue to work with Cummins to develop, manufacture, sell, distribute and service diesel engines, drives, pods and related parts, accessories and services, the inability to successfully implement the transition could adversely affect the Company’s ability to meet customer demand for products, which could have an adverse impact on operating and financial results.Adverse economic, credit and capital market conditions could have a negative impact on the Company’s financial results. The Company does not frequently rely on short-term capital markets to meet its working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, pay dividends, or fund employee benefit programs; however, the Company does maintain short-term borrowing facilities which can be used to meet these capital requirements.  In addition, over the long term, the Company may determine that it is necessary to access the capital markets to refinance existing long-term indebtedness or for other initiatives. Adverse global economic conditions, market volatility and heightened governmental regulation could lead to volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets.  This could adversely affect the Company’s ability to access capital and credit markets or increase the cost to do so, which could have a negative impact on its business, financial results and competitive position. Inventory reductions by major dealers, retailers and independent boat builders could adversely affect the Company’s financial results. In response to higher than desired dealer inventory levels or dealer inventory being aged beyond preferred levels, the Company could decide to implement a pipeline reduction strategy to reduce the number of units held by its dealers. Such efforts, combined with retail discounting, would likely result in lower production levels of the Company’s products, thus resulting in lower rates of absorption of fixed costs in the Company’s manufacturing facilities and lower margins. While actions taken have returned dealer inventories to more appropriate levels, the potential need for future inventory reductions by dealers and independent boatbuilder customers could impair the Company’s future sales and results of operations. The Company may be required to repurchase inventory or accounts of certain dealers. The Company has agreements with certain third-party finance companies to provide financing to the Company’s customers to enable the purchase of its products.  In connection with these agreements, the Company either may have obligations to repurchase the Company’s products from the finance company, or may have recourse obligations to the finance company on the dealer’s receivables.  These obligations are triggered if the Company’s dealers default on their debt obligations to the finance companies.    14    The Company’s maximum contingent obligation to repurchase inventory and its maximum contingent recourse obligations on customer receivables are less than the total balances of dealer financings outstanding under these programs, as the Company’s obligations under certain of these arrangements are subject to caps, or are limited based on the age of product.  The Company’s risk related to these arrangements is mitigated by the proceeds it receives on the resale of repurchased product to other dealers, or by recoveries on receivables purchased under the recourse obligations. The Company’s inventory repurchase obligations relate primarily to the inventory floorplan credit facilities of the Company’s boat and engine dealers. The Company’s actual historical repurchase experience related to these arrangements has been substantially less than the Company’s maximum contractual obligations. If dealers file for bankruptcy or cease operations, losses associated with the repurchase of the Company’s products could be incurred.  The Company’s net sales and earnings may be unfavorably affected as a result of reduced market coverage and the associated decline in sales. Declines in marine industry demand could cause an increase in future repurchase activity, or could require the Company to incur losses in excess of established reserves.  In addition, the Company’s cash flow and loss experience could be adversely affected if inventory is not successfully distributed to other dealers in a timely manner, or if the recovery rate on the resale of the product declines.  In addition, the finance companies could require changes in repurchase or recourse terms that would result in an increase in the Company’s contractual contingent obligations.  The loss of key accounts or critical suppliers could harm the Company’s business. If the Company were to experience the loss of a key account, its business could be negatively affected in a significant way.  Similarly, if one of the Company’s most critical suppliers were to close its operations, cease manufacturing or otherwise fail to deliver an essential component necessary to the Company’s manufacturing operations, it could have a detrimental effect on the Company’s ability to manufacture and sell its products, resulting in an interruption in business operations and/or a loss of sales.  In an effort to mitigate the risk associated with the Company’s reliance on such accounts and suppliers, it continually works to monitor such relationships, maintain a complete and competitive product lineup and identify alternative suppliers for key components. The Company’s success depends upon the continued strength of its brands. The Company believes that its brands, including Brunswick, Mercury, Sea Ray, Boston Whaler, Hatteras and Life Fitness, are significant contributors to the success of the Company’s business and that maintaining and enhancing the brands are important to expanding the Company’s customer base.  Failure to continue to promote and protect the Company’s brands may adversely affect the Company’s business and results of operations. The Company’s businesses have a large fixed cost base that can affect its profitability in a declining sales environment. The high fixed cost levels of operating marine production plants can put pressure on profit margins when sales and production decline. The Company’s profitability is dependent, in part, on its ability to spread fixed costs over an increasing number of products sold and shipped, and if the Company makes a decision to reduce its rate of production, gross margins could be negatively affected. Consequently, decreased demand or the need to reduce inventories can lower the Company’s ability to absorb fixed costs and materially impact its results of operations.    15   Successfully establishing a smaller manufacturing footprint is critical to the Company’s operating and financial results. A significant component of the Company’s cost-reduction efforts has been a focus on reducing its manufacturing footprint by consolidating boat and engine production into fewer plants. The Company  completed the consolidation of engine production by transferring sterndrive engine manufacturing operations from its Stillwater, Oklahoma plant to its Fond du Lac, Wisconsin plant in the fourth quarter of 2011 and production commenced later in the fourth quarter of 2011. This plant transition is expected to conclude in 2012. Moving production to a different plant involves risks, including the inability to start up production within the cost and timeframe estimated, supply product to customers when expected and attract a sufficient number of skilled workers to handle the additional production demands.  The inability to successfully implement the Company’s manufacturing footprint initiatives could adversely affect its ability to meet customer demand for products and could increase the cost of production versus projections, both of which could result in a significant adverse impact on operating and financial results. Additionally, expenses associated with plant consolidation, including severance costs and loss of trained employees with knowledge of the Company’s business and operations, could exceed projections and negatively impact financial results. The Company relies on third-party suppliers for the supply of the raw materials, parts and components necessary to manufacture its products.  The Company’s financial results may be adversely affected by an increase in cost, disruption of supply or shortage of or defect in raw materials, parts or product components. Outside suppliers and contract manufacturers provide the Company with raw materials used in its manufacturing processes including oil, aluminum, copper, steel and resins, as well as product parts and components, such as engine blocks and boat windshields.  The prices for these raw materials, parts and components fluctuate depending on market conditions and in some instances, commodity prices.  Substantial increases in the prices of the Company’s raw materials, parts and components would increase the Company’s operating costs, and could reduce its profitability if the Company cannot recoup the increased costs through increased product prices.  In addition, some components used in the Company’s manufacturing processes, including engine blocks and boat windshields, are available from a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers.  Operational and financial difficulties that these or other suppliers currently face or may face in the future could adversely affect their ability to supply the Company with the parts and components it needs, which could significantly disrupt the Company’s operations.  It may be difficult to find a replacement supplier for a limited or sole source raw material, part or component without significant delay or on commercially reasonable terms.  In addition, an uncorrected defect or supplier’s variation in a raw material, part or component, either unknown to the Company or incompatible with the Company’s manufacturing process, could harm the Company’s ability to manufacture products.  Some of the risks that could disrupt the Company’s operations, impair the Company’s ability to deliver products to the Company’s customers and negatively affect the Company’s financial results include: an increase in the cost of, defects in or a sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of some of these raw materials, parts or products that may be caused by delayed start-up periods experienced by the Company’s suppliers as they increase production efforts; financial pressures on the Company’s suppliers due to the weakening economy; and a deterioration of the Company’s relationships with suppliers or by events such as natural disasters, power outages or labor strikes. In addition to the risks described above regarding interruption of supplies, which are exacerbated in the case of single-source suppliers, the exclusive supplier of a key component potentially could exert significant bargaining power over price, quality, warranty claims, or other terms relating to a component.    16   The Company’s manufacturing operations have increased production in 2011 and are expected continue to do so in 2012, and consequently, the Company’s need for raw materials and supplies will increase. The Company’s suppliers must be prepared to ramp up operations and, in many cases, must recall or hire additional workers in order to fulfill the orders placed by the Company and other customers. The Company experienced supply shortages in 2010 and 2011.  The Company continues to work to address this issue by identifying alternative suppliers, working to secure adequate inventories of critical supplies and continually monitoring its supplier base. In the future, however, the Company may continue to experience shortages of, delayed delivery of and/or increased prices for key materials, parts and supplies that are essential to its manufacturing operations. The Company’s pension funding requirements and expenses are affected by certain factors outside its control, including the performance of plan assets, the discount rate used to value liabilities, actuarial data and experience and legal and regulatory changes. The Company’s funding obligations and pension expense for its four qualified pension plans are driven by the performance of assets set aside in trusts for these plans, the discount rate used to value the plans’ liabilities, actuarial data and experience and legal and regulatory funding requirements.  Changes in these factors could have an adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations, liquidity or shareholders’ equity.  In addition, a portion of the Company’s pension plan assets are invested in equity securities which can experience significant declines if financial markets weaken.  The level of the Company’s funding of its qualified pension plan liabilities was approximately 62 percent as of December 31, 2011. The Company’s future pension expenses and funding requirements could increase significantly due to the effect of adverse changes in the discount rate and asset levels along with a decline in the estimated return on plan assets. In addition, the Company could be legally required to make increased contributions to the pension plans, and these contributions could be material and negatively affect the Company’s cash flow. Higher energy costs can adversely affect the Company’s results, especially in the marine and retail bowling center businesses. Higher energy and fuel costs result in increases in operating expenses at the Company’s manufacturing facilities and in the cost of shipping products to customers.  In addition, increases in energy costs can adversely affect the pricing and availability of petroleum-based raw materials such as resins and foam that are used in many of the Company’s marine products.  Also, higher fuel prices may have an adverse effect on demand for marine retail products as they increase the cost of boat ownership, and may have a negative impact on operating margins, particularly in the Fitness segment, as transportation costs increase.  Finally, because heating and air conditioning comprise a significant part of the cost of operating a bowling center, any increase in the price of energy could adversely affect the operating margins of the Company’s bowling centers. The Company’s profitability may suffer as a result of competitive pricing and other pressures. The introduction of lower-priced alternative products by other companies can hurt the Company’s competitive position in all of its businesses.  The Company is constantly subject to competitive pressures, particularly in the outboard engine market, in which predominantly Asian manufacturers often have pursued a strategy of aggressive pricing particularly during periods when the Japanese yen weakens versus the U.S. dollar.  Such pricing pressure may limit the Company’s ability to increase prices for its products in response to raw material and other cost increases and negatively affect the Company’s profit margins. In addition, the Company’s independent boat builder customers may react negatively to potential competition for their products from Brunswick’s own boat brands, which can lead them to purchase marine engines and marine engine supplies from competing marine engine manufacturers and may negatively affect demand for the Company’s products.    17   The Company’s ability to remain competitive depends on the successful introduction of new product offerings and the ability to meet our customers’ expectations. The Company believes that its customers rigorously evaluate their suppliers on the basis of product quality, new product innovation and development capability. The Company’s ability to remain competitive may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development, such as an inability to develop viable new products, gain market acceptance of new products, generate sufficient capital to fund new product development or obtain adequate intellectual property protection for new products. To meet ever-changing consumer demands, the timing of market entry and pricing of new products are critical.  As a result, the Company may not be able to introduce new products necessary to remain competitive in all markets that it serves.  Furthermore, the Company must deliver quality products that meet or exceed its customers’ expectations regarding product quality and after-sales service. The Company competes with a variety of other activities for consumers’ scarce discretionary income and leisure time. The vast majority of the Company’s products are used for recreational purposes, and demand for the Company’s products can be adversely affected by competition from other activities that occupy consumers’ time, including other forms of recreation as well as religious, cultural and community activities. Additionally, the decrease in consumers’ discretionary income as a result of the recent economic environment has influenced consumers’ willingness to purchase and enjoy the Company’s products. The Company manufactures and sells products that create exposure to potential product liability, warranty liability, personal injury and property damage claims and litigation. The Company’s products may expose it to potential product liability, warranty liability, personal injury or property damage claims relating to the use of those products. The Company’s manufacturing consolidation efforts could result in product quality issues, thereby increasing the risk of litigation and potential liability. To address this risk, the Company has established a global, enterprise-wide organization charged with the responsibility of reviewing and addressing product quality issues.  Historically, the resolution of such claims has not materially adversely affected the Company’s business, and the Company maintains insurance coverage to mitigate a portion of these risks, which it believes to be adequate.  However, the Company may experience material losses in the future, incur significant costs to defend claims or experience claims in excess of its insurance coverage or claims that will not be covered by insurance.  Furthermore, the Company’s reputation may be adversely affected by such claims, whether or not successful, including potential negative publicity about its products. The Company records reserves for known potential liabilities, but there is the possibility that actual losses may exceed these reserves and therefore negatively impact earnings.   18  Environmental laws and zoning and other requirements can inhibit the Company’s ability to grow its marine businesses. Environmental restrictions, boat plant emission restrictions and permitting and zoning requirements can limit access to water for boating, as well as marina and storage space.  In addition, certain jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States require or are considering requiring a license to operate a recreational boat.  While such licensing requirements are not expected to be unduly restrictive, they may deter potential customers, thereby reducing the Company’s sales.  Furthermore, regulations allowing the sale of fuel containing higher levels of ethanol for automobiles, which is not approved or intended for use in marine engines, may nonetheless result in increased warranty, service and other claims against the Company if boaters mistakenly use this fuel in marine engines, causing damage to and the degradation of components in their marine engines. Compliance with environmental regulations affecting marine engines will increase costs and may reduce demand for the Company’s products. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s emission regulations require certain gasoline sterndrive and inboard engines to be equipped with a catalyst exhaust monitoring and treatment system.  It is possible that environmental regulatory bodies may impose higher emissions standards in the future for marine engines.  Compliance with these standards would increase the cost to manufacture and the price to the customer for the Company’s engines, which could in turn reduce consumer demand for the Company’s marine products and potentially reduce operating margins. An increase in the cost of marine engines, an increase in the retail price to consumers or unforeseen delays in compliance with environmental regulations affecting these products could have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations.The Company’s businesses may be adversely affected by compliance obligations and liabilities under various laws and regulations. The Company is subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including product safety, environmental, health and safety laws and other regulations.  While the Company believes that it maintains all requisite licenses and permits and that it is in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, a failure to satisfy these and other regulatory requirements could cause the Company to incur fines or penalties, and compliance could increase its cost of operations.  The adoption of additional laws, rules and regulations could also increase the Company’s capital or operating costs. The Company’s manufacturing processes involve the use, handling, storage and contracting for recycling or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes.  Accordingly, the Company is subject to regulations regarding these substances, and the misuse or mishandling of such substances could expose it to liabilities, including claims for property or natural resources damages or personal injury, or fines.  The Company is also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property.  If a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from any of the Company’s current or former properties or another location where it has disposed of hazardous materials, the Company may be held liable for the contamination, regardless of knowledge or whether it was at fault in connection with the release, and the amount of such liability could be material. Additionally, the Company is subject to laws governing its relationship with its employees, including, but not limited to, employee wage, hour and benefit issues, such as pension funding and health care benefits.  Changes to such legislation could increase the cost of the Company’s operations. Specifically, the effects of The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, once ultimately determined, may have an adverse effect on the financial operations of the Company, primarily in the bowling retail business.    19   Increases in income tax rates or changes in income tax laws could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.Changes in domestic and international tax legislation could expose the Company to additional tax liability.  Although the Company carefully monitors changes in tax laws and works to mitigate the impact of proposed changes, such changes may negatively impact the Company’s financial results.  In addition, any increase in individual income tax rates would negatively affect our potential customers’ discretionary income and could decrease the demand for the Company’s products.If the Company’s intellectual property protection is inadequate, others may be able to use its technologies and thereby reduce the Company’s ability to compete, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company, its financial condition and results of operations. The Company regards much of the technology underlying its products as proprietary.  The steps the Company takes to protect its proprietary technology may be inadequate to prevent misappropriation of the Company’s technology, or third parties may independently develop similar technology.  The Company relies on a combination of patents, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws; employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements; and other contracts to establish and protect its technology and other intellectual property rights.  The agreements may be breached or terminated, the Company may not have adequate remedies for any such breach, and existing patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws afford it limited protection.  Policing unauthorized use of the Company’s intellectual property is difficult, particularly in many regions outside the United States.  A third party could copy or otherwise obtain and use the Company’s products or technology without authorization. Litigation may be necessary for the Company to defend against claims of infringement or to protect its intellectual property rights and could result in substantial cost.  Further, the Company might not prevail in such litigation, which could harm its business. Some of the Company’s operations are conducted by joint ventures that are not operated solely for its benefit. Some of the Company’s operations are carried on through jointly owned companies such as BAC, Tohatsu Marine Corporation or CMD.  With respect to these joint ventures, the Company shares ownership and management of these companies with one or more parties who may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities or resources as the Company.  These joint ventures are intended to be operated for the equal benefit of all co-owners, rather than for the Company’s exclusive benefit.  Changes in currency exchange rates can adversely affect the Company’s results. The Company derives a portion of its revenues from outside the United States (40 percent in 2011).  The Company manufactures its products primarily in the United States and the costs of the Company’s products are generally denominated in U.S. dollars, although the increase in manufacturing and sourcing of products and materials outside the United States continues to be a strategic focus.  The Company sells a portion of these products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Consequently, a strong U.S. dollar can make the Company’s products less price-competitive relative to local products outside the United States, and can adversely affect its financial performance. Although the Company enters into currency exchange contracts to reduce its risk related to currency exchange fluctuations, it is impossible to hedge against all currency risk, especially over the long term, and changes in the relative values of currencies may occur from time to time and, in some instances, affect the Company’s results of operations.  The Company is also exposed to the risk that its counterparties to hedging contracts could default on their obligations, which may have an adverse effect on the Company.    20   A growing portion of the Company’s revenue may be derived from international sources, which exposes it to additional uncertainty. Approximately 40 percent of the Company’s 2011 sales were derived from sources outside the United States and the Company intends to continue to expand its international operations and customer base.  Sales outside the United States, especially in emerging markets, are subject to various risks including government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions, tariffs, fuel duties, inflation, difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems, compliance with international laws, treaties and regulations and unexpected changes in regulatory environments, disruptions in distribution, dependence on foreign personnel and unions, as well as economic and social instability.  In addition, there may be tax inefficiencies in repatriating cash from non-U.S. subsidiaries.  If the Company continues to expand its business globally, its success will depend, in part, on the Company’s ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks.  These and other factors may have a material impact on the Company’s international operations or its business as a whole. An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill, trade names and other long-lived assets could negatively affect the Company’s consolidated results of operations and net worth. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as the Company’s trade names, are recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition and are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise.  In evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill and trade names, the Company makes assumptions regarding future operating performance, business trends and market and economic conditions.  Such analyses further require the Company to make certain assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates.  There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and in applying these factors to the assessment of goodwill and trade name recoverability.  Goodwill reviews are prepared using estimates of the fair value of reporting units based on the estimated present value of future discounted cash flows.  The Company could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill or trade names prior to the annual assessment if it experiences disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, a divestiture of a significant component of the Company’s business or market capitalization declines. The Company also continually evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of its definite-lived intangible assets, excluding goodwill, and other long-lived assets may warrant revision or whether the remaining balance of such assets may not be recoverable.  The Company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flow over the remaining life of the asset in measuring whether the asset is recoverable. If the future operating performance of the Company’s reporting units is not consistent with the Company’s assumptions, the Company could be required to record additional non-cash impairment charges.  Impairment charges could substantially affect the Company’s reported earnings in the periods such charges are recorded.  In addition, impairment charges could indicate a reduction in business value which could limit the Company’s ability to obtain adequate financing in the future.  As of December 31, 2011, goodwill was approximately 12 percent of total assets and included $269.9 million of goodwill related to the Life Fitness segment and $20.4 million of goodwill related to the Marine Engine segment.   21  Adverse weather conditions can have a negative effect on marine and retail bowling center revenues. Weather conditions can have a significant effect on the Company’s operating and financial results, especially in the marine and retail bowling center businesses.  Sales of the Company’s marine products are generally stronger just before and during spring and summer, and favorable weather during these months generally has a positive effect on consumer demand.  Conversely, unseasonably cool weather, excessive rainfall or drought conditions during these periods can reduce demand.  Hurricanes and other storms can result in the disruption of the Company’s distribution channel. In addition, severely inclement weather on weekends and holidays, particularly during the winter months, can adversely affect patronage of the Company’s bowling centers and, therefore, revenues in the retail bowling center business. Additionally, in the event that climate change occurs, which could result in environmental changes including, but not limited to, severe weather, rising sea levels or reduced access to water, the Company’s business could be disrupted and negatively affected. Instability in locations where the Company maintains a significant presence could adversely impact the Company’s business operations. The Company has established a global presence, with manufacturing, sales, distribution and retail locations around the world.  Changing conditions in those locations, including, but not limited to, political instability, civil unrest and an increase in criminal activity, could have a negative impact on the Company’s local manufacturing and other business operations.  Decreased stability in those regions where the Company conducts business poses a risk of business interruption and delays in shipments of materials, components and finished goods, as well as a risk of decreased local retail demand for the Company’s products in those regions. Catastrophic events, including natural and environmental disasters, could have a negative effect on the Company’s operations and financial results. The occurrence of natural and environmental disasters, including hurricanes, floods, earthquakes and environmental spills, could decrease consumer demand for and sales of the Company’s products.  In the event that such an occurrence takes place in one of Brunswick’s major sales markets, the Company could experience a decrease in sales.  Additionally, if such an event occurs near the Company’s business, manufacturing facilities or key suppliers’ facilities, the affected locations could experience an interruption in business operations and/or their operating systems. The Company’s operations are dependent upon the services of key individuals, the loss of whom may have an adverse effect. The Company’s operations depend, in part, on the efforts of the Company’s executive officers and other key employees.  In addition, the Company’s future success will depend on, among other factors, its ability to attract and retain other qualified personnel. The loss of the services of any of the Company’s key employees or the failure to attract or retain employees could have an adverse effect on the Company.  The Company’s restructuring activities, which have resulted in substantial employee terminations, may make it more difficult for the Company to attract or retain employees and it may be adversely affected for some time by the loss of trained employees with knowledge of the Company’s business and industries.  If the Company is unable to attract and retain qualified individuals, or the Company’s costs to do so increase significantly, the Company’s operations could be adversely affected.   22  The Company’s business operations could be negatively impacted by the failure of its information technology systems. The Company’s global business operations are managed through a variety of information technology (IT) systems, some of which are legacy systems with a minimal level of support, which the Company plans to replace over a period of years.  If one of these legacy systems, or another of the Company’s key IT systems were to suffer a failure, or if the Company’s IT systems were unable to communicate effectively, this could result in missed or delayed sales, or lost opportunities for cost reduction or efficient cash management. "
7,BC,BRUNSWICK CORP,2011-02-18,"Risk Factors
The Company’s operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of the Company’s common stock.Worldwide economic conditions, particularly in the United States and Europe, have adversely affected the Company’s industries, businesses and results of operations and may continue to do so.  Beginning in 2008, general worldwide economic conditions, particularly in the United States and Europe, experienced a downturn due to the effects of the subprime lending crisis, general credit market crisis, collateral effects on the finance and banking industries, increased energy costs, concerns about inflation, slower economic activity, decreased consumer confidence, reduced corporate profits and capital spending, adverse business conditions and liquidity concerns.  In times of economic uncertainty and contraction, consumers tend to have less discretionary income and to defer expenditures for discretionary items, which adversely affects the Company’s financial performance, especially in its marine businesses.  A majority of the Company’s businesses are cyclical in nature and are highly sensitive to personal discretionary spending levels, and their success is dependent upon favorable economic conditions, the overall level of consumer confidence and personal income levels. Other factors negatively affecting the Company’s financial results, which may continue to do so, include: the impact of weakening consumer and corporate credit markets; continued reduction in marine industry demand; corporate restructurings; declines in the value of investments and residential real estate, especially in large boating markets such as Florida and California; and higher fuel prices.Demand for the Company’s marine products has been significantly reduced by weak economic conditions, low consumer confidence, high unemployment and increased market volatility worldwide, especially in the United States and Europe.  The Company estimates that retail unit sales of powerboats in the United States were down significantly during 2010. Any deterioration in general economic conditions that further diminishes consumer confidence or discretionary income may further reduce the Company’s sales and adversely affect its financial results, including increasing the potential for future impairment charges.  The Company cannot predict the timing or strength of economic recovery, either worldwide or in the specific markets where it competes.The economic factors discussed above have also reduced the ability of fitness centers and bowling retail centers to invest in new equipment, which has adversely affected sales in the Company’s Fitness and Bowling & Billiards segments.Although consumer credit markets have improved, tight consumer credit markets have reduced demand, especially for marine products, and may continue to do so. Customers often finance purchases of the Company’s marine products, particularly boats. Credit market conditions improved during 2010, but remained less favorable than those experienced prior to the decline in marine retail demand. These overall declines in the lending environment include fewer lenders, tighter underwriting and loan approval criteria, greater down payment requirements and, in some cases, higher interest rates.  If credit conditions worsen, and adversely affect the ability of customers to finance potential purchases at acceptable terms and interest rates, it could result in a further decrease in sales of the Company’s products or delay any improvement in its sales. The inability of the Company’s dealers and distributors to secure adequate access to capital could adversely affect the Company’s sales. The Company’s dealers require adequate liquidity to finance their operations, including purchases of the Company’s products.  Dealers are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that could unfavorably affect their liquidity positions, including, among other things, continued access to adequate financing sources on a timely basis on reasonable terms.  These sources of financing are vital to the Company’s ability to sell products through the Company’s distribution network, particularly to its boat and engine dealers.  During the recent credit crisis, several third-party floorplan lenders ceased their lending operations, or materially reduced their exposure.  A significant portion of the Company’s domestic and international boat and engine sales to dealers are financed through entities affiliated with GE  Capital Corporation (GECC), including BAC (the Company’s 49 percent owned joint venture, with the other 51 percent being owned by CDFV, a subsidiary of GECC),  which provides floorplan financing to domestic marine dealers.BAC commenced operations in 2003, and in the second quarter of 2008, the term of the joint venture was extended through June 2014.  The joint venture is funded with the capital contributions from the joint venture partners, along with a $1.0 billion secured credit line provided by GE Commercial Distribution Finance Corporation (GECDF), which is in place through the term of the joint venture, and through receivable sales to a securitization facility arranged by GECDF.  The Company does not guarantee the debt of BAC.  GECDF may, however, terminate the joint venture if the Company is unable to maintain compliance with the minimum fixed-charge coverage ratio covenant included in the joint venture agreement, which is the same as the covenant in the Company’s revolving credit facility.The availability and terms of financing offered by the Company’s dealer floorplan financing providers (including BAC and others) will continue to be influenced by: their ability to access certain capital markets, including the securitization and the commercial paper markets, and to fund their operations in a cost effective manner; the performance of their overall credit portfolios; their willingness to accept the risks associated with lending to marine dealers; and the overall creditworthiness of those dealers.  The Company’s sales could be adversely affected if BAC were to be terminated, if further declines in floorplan financing availability occur, or if financing terms become more adverse.  This could require the Company to find alternative sources of financing, including the Company providing this financing directly to dealers, which could require additional capital to fund the associated receivables. The Company’s financial results may be adversely affected if it is unable to maintain effective distribution. The Company relies on third-party dealers and distributors to sell the majority of its products, particularly in the marine business.  The ability to maintain a reliable network of dealers is essential to the Company’s success.  The Company faces competition from other boat manufacturers in attracting and retaining distributors and independent boat dealers. A significant deterioration in the number or effectiveness of the Company’s dealers and distributors could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial results.  Weak demand for marine products has adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect the financial performance of the Company’s dealers.  In particular, reduced cash flow from decreased sales and tighter credit markets may impair a dealer’s ability to fund operations.  A continued inability to fund operations can force dealers to cease business, and the Company may not be able to obtain alternate distribution in the vacated market. An inability to obtain alternate distribution could unfavorably affect the Company’s net sales through lower market exposure. The Company anticipates that dealer failures or voluntary market exits could continue into future periods, especially if overall retail demand for boats continues to decline.    7    Adverse economic, credit and capital market conditions could have a negative impact on the Company’s financial results.The Company does not frequently utilize short-term capital markets to meet its working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, pay dividends, or fund employee benefit programs; however, the Company does maintain short-term borrowing facilities which can be used to meet these capital requirements.  In addition, over the long term, the Company may determine that it is necessary to access the capital markets to refinance existing long-term indebtedness or for other initiatives.Adverse global economic conditions, market volatility and heightened governmental regulation could lead to volatility and disruptions in the capital and credit markets.  This could adversely affect the Company’s ability to access capital and credit markets or increase the cost to do so, which could have a negative impact on its business, financial results and competitive position.Inventory reductions by major dealers, retailers and independent boat builders could adversely affect the Company’s financial results. Dealer inventory levels in 2008 and the first half of 2009 were higher than desired and dealer inventory was aged beyond preferred levels.  In response, in 2009, the Company implemented a focused pipeline strategy to reduce the number of units held by its dealers, which reduced field inventory by over 13,000 units versus 2008 levels.  Such efforts, combined with retail discounting, resulted in diminished pipeline levels of the Company’s products. To achieve these reductions, the Company reduced 2009 boat production by approximately 65 percent as compared to the prior year (resulting in lower rates of absorption of fixed costs in the Company’s manufacturing facilities and thus lower margins) and provided substantial support to dealers through retail discount programs designed to reduce aged inventory.60; While conditions have improved as a result of the Company’s efforts, the potential need for future inventory reductions by dealers and independent boatbuilder customers could impair the Company’s future sales and results of operations.Excess supply of repossessed and aged boats can adversely affect industry pricing.Boats entering the market through non-traditional avenues, such as dealer and independent boat builder failures and consumer-related repossessions, could result in an excess supply of repossessed boats, having an adverse effect on industry pricing. Failed or struggling dealers and boat builders may be required to sell their inventory at significantly reduced or liquidation prices in order to pay their financial obligations. These supply conditions could result in higher discounts and sales incentives used to facilitate retail boat sales, which could lead to lower sales or result in pressure on wholesale prices.  The Company may be required to repurchase inventory or accounts of certain dealers.The Company has agreements with certain third-party finance companies to provide financing to the Company’s customers to enable the purchase of its products.  In connection with these agreements, the Company may have obligations to either repurchase the Company’s products from the finance company, or may have recourse obligations to the finance company on the dealer’s receivables.  These obligations are triggered if the Company’s dealers default on their debt obligations to the finance companies.The Company’s maximum contingent obligation to repurchase inventory and its maximum contingent recourse obligations on customer receivables are less than the total balances of dealer financings outstanding under these programs, as the Company’s obligations under certain of these arrangements are subject to caps, or are limited based on the age of product.  The Company’s risk related to these arrangements is mitigated by the proceeds it receives on the resale of repurchased product to other dealers, or by recoveries on receivables purchased under the recourse obligations. The Company’s inventory repurchase obligations relate primarily to the inventory floorplan credit facilities of the Company’s boat and engine dealers. The Company’s actual historical repurchase experience related to these arrangements has been substantially less than the Company’s maximum contractual obligations. If additional dealers file for bankruptcy or cease operations, additional losses associated with the repurchase of the Company’s products will be incurred.  The Company’s net sales and earnings may be unfavorably affected as a result of reduced market coverage and the associated decline in sales. Continued weakness in the marine industry could cause an increase in future repurchase activity, or could require the Company to incur losses in excess of established reserves.  In addition, the Company’s cash flow and loss experience could be adversely affected if inventory is not successfully distributed to other dealers in a timely manner, or if the recovery rate on the resale of the product declines.  In addition, the finance companies could require changes in repurchase or recourse terms that would result in an increase in the Company’s contractual contingent obligations.    8    The loss of key accounts or critical suppliers could harm the Company’s business.  If the Company were to experience the loss of a key account, its business could be negatively affected in a significant way.  Similarly, if one of the Company’s most critical suppliers were to close its operations, cease manufacturing or otherwise fail to deliver an essential component necessary to the Company’s manufacturing operations, it could have a detrimental effect on the Company’s ability to manufacture and sell its products, resulting in an interruption in business operations and/or a loss of sales.  In an effort to mitigate the risk associated with the Company’s reliance on such accounts and suppliers, it continually works to monitor such relationships, maintain a complete and competitive product lineup and identify alternative suppliers for key components. The Company’s success depends upon the continued strength of its brands.  The Company believes that its brands, including Brunswick, Mercury, Sea Ray, Boston Whaler, Hatteras and Life Fitness, are significant contributors to the success of the Company’s business and that maintaining and enhancing the brands are important to expanding the Company’s customer base.  Failure to protect the Company’s brands from infringers may adversely affect the Company’s business and results of operations.The Company’s businesses have a large fixed cost base that can affect its profitability in a declining sales environment. The high levels of fixed costs of operating marine production plants can put pressure on profit margins. The Company’s profitability is dependent, in part, on its ability to spread fixed costs over an increasing number of products sold and shipped, and if the Company makes a decision to reduce its rate of production, as it did in 2008 and 2009, gross margins could be negatively affected. Decreased demand or the need to reduce inventories can lower the Company’s ability to absorb fixed costs and materially impact its results of operations.Successfully establishing a smaller manufacturing footprint is critical to the Company’s operating and financial results. A significant component of the Company’s cost-reduction efforts has been a focus on reducing its manufacturing footprint by consolidating boat and engine production into fewer plants.  Since January 1, 2007, the Company has closed 17 of its boat manufacturing facilities.  Additionally, during the third quarter of 2009, the Company announced plans to consolidate engine production by transferring sterndrive engine manufacturing operations from its Stillwater, Oklahoma plant to its Fond du Lac, Wisconsin plant. This plant consolidation effort is underway and is expected to be completed in 2011.Moving production to a different plant involves risks, including the inability to start up production within the cost and timeframe estimated, supply product to customers when expected and attract a sufficient number of skilled workers to handle the additional production demands.  The inability to successfully implement the Company’s manufacturing footprint initiatives could adversely affect its operating and financial results. Additionally, expenses associated with plant consolidation, including severance costs, pension funding requirements and loss of trained employees with knowledge of the Company’s business and operations, could exceed projections and negatively impact financial results.The Company’s inability to successfully implement its restructuring initiatives and other uncertainties could negatively affect the Company’s liquidity position, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business. The Company’s ability to successfully generate cash flow will depend on the continued successful execution of its restructuring initiatives and its plans to consolidate manufacturing operations, in order to return the Company’s marine operations to profitability.  The Company is subject to numerous other risks and uncertainties that could negatively affect its cash flow in the future, which may include the continued reduction in marine industry demand as a result of a weak global economy resulting in, among other things: (i) the failure of the Company’s customers to pay amounts owed on a timely basis; (ii) an increase in the Company’s obligations to repurchase its products or make recourse payments on customers’ debt obligations; and/or (iii) an increase in retail incentives in order to facilitate the sale of dealer inventories.  The continuation of, or adverse change with respect to, one or more of these trends would weaken the Company’s competitive position and materially adversely affect the Company’s ability to satisfy its anticipated cash requirements.    9    The Company relies on third-party suppliers for the supply of the raw materials, parts and components necessary to manufacture its products.  The Company’s financial results may be adversely affected by an increase in cost, disruption of supply or shortage of or defect in raw materials, parts or product components. Outside suppliers and contract manufacturers provide the Company with raw materials used in its manufacturing processes including oil, aluminum, copper, steel and resins, as well as product parts and components, such as engine blocks and boat windshields.  The prices for these raw materials, parts and components fluctuate depending on market conditions and in some instances, commodity prices.  Substantial increases in the prices of the Company’s raw materials, parts and components would increase the Company’s operating costs, and could reduce its profitability if the Company cannot recoup the increased costs through increased product prices.  In addition, some components used in the Company’s manufacturing processes, including engine blocks and boat windshields, are available from a sole supplier or a limited number of suppliers.  Operational and financial difficulties that these or other suppliers currently face or may face in the future could adversely affect their ability to supply the Company with the parts and components it needs, which could significantly disrupt the Company’s operations.  It may be difficult to find a replacement supplier for a limited or sole source raw material, part or component without significant delay or on commercially reasonable terms.  In addition, an uncorrected defect or supplier’s variation in a raw material, part or component, either unknown to the Company or incompatible with the Company’s manufacturing process, could harm the Company’s ability to manufacture products.  Some of the risks that could disrupt the Company’s operations, impair the Company’s ability to deliver products to the Company’s customers and negatively affect the Company’s financial results include: an increase in the cost of, defects in or a sustained interruption in the supply or shortage of some of these raw materials, parts or products that may be caused by delayed start-up periods experienced by the Company’s suppliers as they increase production efforts; financial pressures on the Company’s suppliers due to the weakening economy; and a deterioration of the Company’s relationships with suppliers or by events such as natural disasters, power outages or labor strikes. In addition to the risks described above regarding interruption of supplies, which are exacerbated in the case of single-source suppliers, the exclusive supplier of a key component potentially could exert significant bargaining power over price, quality, warranty claims, or other terms relating to a component.Additionally, as a result of recent worldwide economic conditions and the reduced demand for raw materials, parts, supplies and goods, many of the Company’s suppliers made the decision to slow or temporarily cease production in 2008, 2009 and 2010. Additionally, many of the Company’s suppliers have elected to reduce the size of their workforces. The Company’s manufacturing operations have increased production in 2010 and will continue to do so in 2011, and consequently, the Company’s need for raw materials and supplies will likewise increase. The Company’s suppliers must be prepared to ramp up operations and, in many cases, must recall or hire additional workers in order to fulfill the orders placed by the Company and other customers. In 2009, the Company began experiencing some supply shortages which continued into 2010.  The Company continues to work to address this issue by identifying alternative suppliers, working to secure adequate inventories of critical supplies and continually monitoring its supplier base. In the future, however, the Company may continue to experience shortages of, delayed delivery of and/or increased prices for key materials, parts and supplies that are essential to its manufacturing operations. The Company’s pension funding requirements and expenses are affected by certain factors outside its control, including the performance of plan assets, the discount rate used to value liabilities, actuarial data and experience and legal and regulatory changes. The Company’s funding obligations and pension expense for its four qualified pension plans are driven by the performance of assets set aside in trusts for these plans, the discount rate used to value the plans’ liabilities, actuarial data and experience and legal and regulatory funding requirements.  Changes in these factors could have an adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations, liquidity or shareholders’ equity.  In addition, a significant percentage of the Company’s pension plan assets are invested in equity securities.  The level of the Company’s funding of its qualified pension plan liabilities is approximately 63 percent as of December 31, 2010. The Company’s future pension expenses and funding requirements could increase significantly due to the effect of changes in the discount rate and asset levels along with a decline in the estimated return on plan assets. In addition, the Company could be legally required to make increased contributions to the pension plans, and these contributions could be material and negatively affect the Company’s cash flow.Higher energy costs can adversely affect the Company’s results, especially in the marine and retail bowling center businesses. Higher energy and fuel costs result in increases in operating expenses at the Company’s manufacturing facilities and in the cost of shipping products to customers.  In addition, increases in energy costs can adversely affect the pricing and availability of petroleum-based raw materials such as resins and foam that are used in many of the Company’s marine products.  Also, higher fuel prices may have an adverse effect on demand for marine retail products as they increase the cost of boat ownership, and may have a negative impact on operating margins, particularly in the Fitness segment, as transportation costs increase.  Finally, because heating and air conditioning comprise a significant part of the cost of operating a bowling center, any increase in the price of energy could adversely affect the operating margins of the Company’s bowling centers.The Company’s profitability may suffer as a result of competitive pricing and other pressures. The introduction of lower-priced alternative products by other companies can hurt the Company’s competitive position in all of its businesses.  The Company is constantly subject to competitive pressures, particularly in the outboard engine market, in which predominantly Asian manufacturers often have pursued a strategy of aggressive pricing particularly during periods when the Japanese yen weakens versus the U.S. dollar.  Such pricing pressure may limit the Company’s ability to increase prices for its products in response to raw material and other cost increases and negatively affect the Company’s profit margins.In addition, the Company’s independent boat builder customers may react negatively to potential competition for their products from Brunswick’s own boat brands, which can lead them to purchase marine engines and marine engine supplies from competing marine engine manufacturers and may negatively affect demand for the Company’s products.The Company’s ability to remain competitive depends on the successful introduction of new product offerings and the ability to meet our customers’ expectations. The Company believes that its customers rigorously evaluate their suppliers on the basis of product quality, new product innovation and development capability. The Company’s ability to remain competitive may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development, such as an inability to develop viable new products, gain market acceptance of new products, generate sufficient capital to fund new product development or obtain adequate intellectual property protection for new products. Additionally, in 2008 and 2009, the Company decreased the amount spent on research and development, and, although the Company increased the amount of spending in 2010, it was a lower percentage of revenues than in prior years.  As a result, this may affect the number of new products it may be able to develop. To meet ever-changing consumer demands, the timing of market entry and pricing of new products are critical.  As a result, the Company may not be able to introduce new products necessary to remain competitive in all markets that it serves.  Furthermore, the Company must deliver quality products that meet or exceed its customers’ expectations regarding product quality and after-sales service.   10    The Company competes with a variety of other activities for consumers’ scarce discretionary income and leisure time. The vast majority of the Company’s products are used for recreational purposes, and demand for the Company’s products can be adversely affected by competition from other activities that occupy consumers’ time, including other forms of recreation as well as religious, cultural and community activities. The decrease in discretionary income as a result of the recent economic environment has reduced consumers’ willingness to purchase and enjoy the Company’s products.  The Company manufactures and sells products that create exposure to potential product liability, warranty liability, personal injury and property damage claims and litigation. The Company’s products may expose it to potential product liability, warranty liability, personal injury or property damage claims relating to the use of those products. The Company’s manufacturing consolidation efforts could result in product quality issues, thereby increasing the risk of litigation and potential liability. To address this risk, the Company has established a global, enterprise-wide organization charged with the responsibility of reviewing and addressing product quality issues.  Historically, the resolution of such claims has not materially adversely affected the Company’s business, and the Company maintains certain insurance coverage to mitigate a portion of these risks, which it believes to be adequate.  However, the Company may experience material losses in the future, incur significant costs to defend claims or experience claims in excess of its insurance coverages or claims that will not be covered by insurance.  Furthermore, the Company’s reputation may be adversely affected by such claims, whether or not successful, including potential negative publicity about its products.Environmental laws and zoning and other requirements can inhibit the Company’s ability to grow its marine businesses. Environmental restrictions, boat plant emission restrictions and permitting and zoning requirements can limit access to water for boating, as well as marina and storage space.  In addition, certain jurisdictions both inside and outside the United States require or are considering requiring a license to operate a recreational boat.  While such licensing requirements are not expected to be unduly restrictive, they may deter potential customers, thereby reducing the Company’s sales.  Furthermore, regulations allowing the sale of fuel containing higher levels of ethanol for automobiles – which is not approved or intended for use in marine engines – may nonetheless result in increased warranty, service and other claims against the Company if boaters mistakenly use this fuel in marine engines, causing damage to and the degradation of components in their marine engines. The Company’s businesses may be adversely affected by compliance obligations and liabilities under various laws and regulations. The Company is subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations, including product safety, environmental, health and safety laws and other regulations.  While the Company believes that it maintains all requisite licenses and permits and that it is in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, a failure to satisfy these and other regulatory requirements could cause the Company to incur fines or penalties, and compliance could increase its cost of operations.  The adoption of additional laws, rules and regulations could also increase the Company’s capital or operating costs.The Company’s manufacturing processes involve the use, handling, storage and contracting for recycling or disposal of hazardous or toxic substances or wastes.  Accordingly, the Company is subject to regulations regarding these substances, and the misuse or mishandling of such substances could expose it to liabilities, including claims for property or natural resources damages or personal injury, or fines.  The Company is also subject to laws requiring the cleanup of contaminated property.  If a release of hazardous substances occurs at or from any of the Company’s current or former properties or another location where it has disposed of hazardous materials, the Company may be held liable for the contamination, regardless of knowledge or whether it was at fault in connection with the release, and the amount of such liability could be material.Changes in domestic and international tax legislation could expose the Company to additional tax liability.  Although the Company carefully monitors changes in tax laws and works to mitigate the impact of proposed changes, such changes may negatively impact the Company’s financial results.Additionally, the Company is subject to laws governing its relationship with its employees, including, but not limited to, employee wage and hour and benefit issues, such as pension funding and health care benefits.  Changes to such legislation could increase the cost of the Company’s operations.Compliance with environmental regulations affecting marine engines will increase costs and may reduce demand for the Company’s products. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency adopted emission regulations requiring certain gasoline sterndrive and inboard engines to be equipped with a catalyst exhaust monitoring and treatment system, with an effective date of January 1, 2010.  It is possible that environmental regulatory bodies may impose higher emissions standards in the future for marine engines.  Compliance with these standards would increase the cost to manufacture and the price to the customer for the Company’s engines, which could in turn reduce consumer demand for the Company’s marine products and potentially reduce operating margins. Any increase in the cost of marine engines, an increase in the retail price to consumers or unforeseen delays in compliance with environmental regulations affecting these products could have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations. The Company’s common stock price may fluctuate due to a variety of factors.            The violatility and price of the Company’s common stock may be affected by numerous factors, including changes to generally accepted accounting principles and financial reporting standards. Such developments could materially affect the Company’s financial results and the way that investors perceive the Company’s performance.    11    If the Company’s intellectual property protection is inadequate, others may be able to use its technologies and thereby reduce the Company’s ability to compete, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company, its financial condition and results of operations. The Company regards much of the technology underlying its products as proprietary.  The steps the Company takes to protect its proprietary technology may be inadequate to prevent misappropriation of the Company’s technology, or third parties may independently develop similar technology.  The Company relies on a combination of patents, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws; employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements; and other contracts to establish and protect its technology and other intellectual property rights.  The agreements may be breached or terminated, the Company may not have adequate remedies for any such breach, and existing patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws afford it limited protection.  Policing unauthorized use of the Company’s intellectual property is difficult, particularly in many regions outside the United States.  A third party could copy or otherwise obtain and use the Company’s products or technology without authorization. Litigation may be necessary for the Company to defend against claims of infringement or to protect its intellectual property rights and could result in substantial cost.  Further, the Company might not prevail in such litigation, which could harm its business.Some of the Company’s operations are conducted by joint ventures that it cannot operate solely for its benefit. Some of the Company’s operations are carried on through jointly owned companies such as BAC, Tohatsu Marine Corporation or Cummins MerCruiser Diesel Marine LLC (CMD), Mercury Marine’s joint venture with Cummins Marine, a division of Cummins Inc.  With respect to these joint ventures, the Company shares ownership and management of these companies with one or more parties who may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities or resources as the Company.  These joint ventures are intended to be operated for the equal benefit of all co-owners, rather than for the Company’s exclusive benefit.  Changes in currency exchange rates can adversely affect the Company’s results. Because the Company derives a portion of its revenues from outside the United States (41 percent in 2010), the Company’s financial performance can be adversely affected when the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies.  The Company manufactures its products primarily in the United States and the costs of the Company’s products are generally denominated in U.S. dollars, although the increase in manufacturing and sourcing of products and materials outside the United States continues to be a strategic focus.  The Company sells a portion of these products in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Consequently, a strong U.S. dollar can make the Company’s products less price-competitive relative to local products outside the United States.Although the Company enters into currency exchange contracts to reduce its risk related to currency exchange fluctuations, it is impossible to hedge against all currency risk, especially over the long term, and changes in the relative values of currencies may occur from time to time and, in some instances, affect the Company’s results of operations.  The Company is also exposed to the risk that its counterparties to hedging contracts could default on their obligations, which may have an adverse effect on the Company.A growing portion of the Company’s revenue may be derived from international sources, which exposes it to additional uncertainty. Approximately 41 percent of the Company’s 2010 sales were derived from sources outside the United States, and the Company intends to continue to expand its international operations and customer base.  Sales outside the United States, especially in emerging markets, are subject to various risks including government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions, tariffs, fuel duties, inflation, difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through foreign legal systems, compliance with international laws, treaties and regulations and unexpected changes in regulatory environments, disruptions in distribution, dependence on foreign personnel and unions, as well as economic and social instability.  In addition, there may be tax inefficiencies in repatriating cash from non-U.S. subsidiaries. &#160;If the Company continues to expand its business globally, its success will depend, in part, on the Company’s ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks.  These and other factors may have a material impact on the Company’s international operations or its business as a whole.  An impairment in the carrying value of goodwill, trade names and other long-lived assets could negatively affect the Company’s consolidated results of operations and net worth. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as the Company’s trade names, are recorded at fair value at the time of acquisition and are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise.  In evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill and trade names, the Company makes assumptions regarding future operating performance, business trends and market and economic conditions.  Such analyses further require the Company to make certain assumptions about sales, operating margins, growth rates and discount rates.  There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and in applying these factors to the assessment of goodwill and trade name recoverability.  Goodwill reviews are prepared using estimates of the fair value of reporting units based on market multiples of revenues and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) and on the estimated present value of future discounted cash flows.  The Company could be required to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill or trade names prior to the annual assessment if it experiences disruptions to the business, unexpected significant declines in operating results, divestiture of a significant component of the Company’s business or market capitalization declines. The Company also continually evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful lives of its definite-lived intangible assets, excluding goodwill, and other long-lived assets may warrant revision or whether the remaining balance of such assets may not be recoverable.  The Company uses an estimate of the related undiscounted cash flow over the remaining life of the asset in measuring whether the asset is recoverable.If the future operating performance of the Company’s reporting units is not consistent with the Company’s assumptions, the Company could be required to record additional non-cash impairment charges.  Impairment charges could substantially affect the Company’s reported earnings in the periods of such charges.  In addition, impairment charges could indicate a reduction in business value which could limit the Company’s ability to obtain adequate financing in the future.  As of December 31, 2010, the Company had $270.7 million of goodwill related to the Life Fitness segment and $20.2 million of goodwill related to the Marine Engine segment.  As of December 31, 2010, the Company’s total goodwill represented approximately 11 percent of total assets.    12    Adverse weather conditions can have a negative effect on marine and retail bowling center revenues. Weather conditions can have a significant effect on the Company’s operating and financial results, especially in the marine and retail bowling center businesses.  Sales of the Company’s marine products are generally stronger just before and during spring and summer, and favorable weather during these months generally has a positive effect on consumer demand.  Conversely, unseasonably cool weather, excessive rainfall or drought conditions during these periods can reduce demand.  Hurricanes and other storms can result in the disruption of the Company’s distribution channel. In addition, severely inclement weather on weekends and holidays, particularly during the winter months, can adversely affect patronage of the Company’s bowling centers and, therefore, revenues in the retail bowling center business. Additionally, in the event that climate change occurs, which could result in environmental changes including, but not limited to, severe weather, rising sea levels or reduced access to water, the Company’s business could be disrupted and negatively affected. Instability in locations where the Company maintains a significant presence could adversely impact the Company’s business operations. The Company has established a global presence, with manufacturing, sales, distribution and retail locations around the world.  Changing conditions in those locations, including, but not limited to, political instability, civil unrest and an increase in criminal activity, could have a negative impact on the Company’s local manufacturing and other business operations.  Decreased stability in those regions where the Company conducts business poses a risk of business interruption and delays in shipments of materials, components and finished goods, as well as a risk of decreased local retail demand for the Company’s products in those regions.Catastrophic events, including natural and environmental disasters, could have a negative effect on the Company’s operations and financial results. The occurrence of natural and environmental disasters, including hurricanes, floods, earthquakes and environmental spills, could decrease consumer demand for and sales of the Company’s products.  In the event that such an occurrence takes place in one of Brunswick’s major sales markets, the Company could experience a decrease in sales.  Additionally, if such an event occurs near the Company’s business or manufacturing facilities, the affected locations could experience an interruption in business operations and/or their operating systems.The Company’s operations are dependent upon the services of key individuals, the loss of whom could materially harm us. The Company’s operations depend, in part, on the efforts of the Company’s executive officers and other key employees.  In addition, the Company’s future success will depend on, among other factors, its ability to attract and retain other qualified personnel. The loss of the services of any of the Company’s key employees or the failure to attract or retain employees could have a material adverse effect on the Company.  The Company’s restructuring activities, which have resulted in substantial employee terminations, may make it more difficult for the Company to attract or retain employees and it may be adversely affected for some time by the loss of trained employees with knowledge of the Company’s business and industries.  If the Company is unable to attract and retain qualified individuals, or the Company’s costs to do so increase significantly, the Company’s operations could be materially adversely affected.The Company’s business operations could be negatively impacted by the failure of its information technology systems. The Company’s global business operations are managed through a variety of information technology (IT) systems, some of which are legacy systems with a minimal level of support, which the Company plans to replace over a period of years.  If one of these legacy systems, or another of the Company’s key IT systems were to suffer a failure, or if the Company’s differing IT systems were unable to communicate effectively, this could result in missed or delayed sales, or lost opportunities for cost reduction or efficient cash management"
