11,DOV,DOVER CORP,2024-02-09,"ITEM 1A.   RISK FACTORSThe risk factors discussed in this section should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this Form 10-K and should not be considered the only risks to which we are exposed. In general, we are subject to the same general risks and uncertainties that impact many other industrial companies such as general economic, industry and/or market conditions and growth rates; the impact of natural disasters and their effect on global markets; and changes in laws or accounting rules. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our businesses, including our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Business and Operational Risks•Our businesses or operations may be adversely affected by natural or human-induced disasters, acts of war, terrorism, international conflicts, and public health crises. Our businesses or operations may be adversely affected by natural or human-induced disasters including, but not limited to, earthquakes; tsunamis; floods; hurricanes, cyclones or typhoons; fires; other extreme weather conditions; power or water shortages; telecommunications failures; materials scarcity; terrorist acts, civil unrest, conflicts or wars; and health epidemics or pandemics. The occurrence of any such event, and the measures taken in response thereto, may disrupt the global economy and adversely impact our operations, including demand for our products across multiple end-markets as well as our supply chain and operations. Existing insurance coverage may not provide protection for all of the costs that may arise from such events. Additionally, concerns over the economic impact of such events could cause increased volatility in financial and other capital markets, adversely impacting our stock price, our ability to access the capital markets, and our ability to fund liquidity needs. The impacts of any such unexpected event are difficult to predict but could have a material adverse effect on ourbusinesses, financial condition, or operations.•Recessions, adverse market conditions or downturns in the markets we serve could adversely affect our operations.In the past, our operations have been exposed to volatility due to changes in general economic conditions or consumer preferences, recessions or adverse conditions in the markets we serve. In the future, similar changes could adversely impact overall sales, operating results (including potential impairment charges for goodwill or other long-lived assets) and cash flows. Moreover, during economic downturns we may undertake more extensive restructuring actions, including workforce reductions, global facility consolidations, centralization of certain business support activities, and other cost reduction initiatives, and incur higher costs. As these plans and actions can be complex, the anticipated operational improvements, efficiencies and other benefits might be delayed or not realized. We are unable to determine the impact that recessions, adverse market conditions or downturns will have on our financial position, operating results and cash flows in future periods.•Increases in labor costs, potential labor disputes and work stoppages or an inability to hire skilled personnel could adversely affect our business.We have a number of collective bargaining units in the U.S. and various collective labor arrangements outside the U.S. We are subject to potential work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes, any of which could adversely impact our productivity, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Furthermore, the competition for skilled personnel is often intense in the regions in which our manufacturing facilities are located. A sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our employee base, increases in the salaries and wages paid by competing employers, as a result of general macroeconomic factors or otherwise, could lead to increased costs, such as increased overtime to meet demand and potentially further increase salaries and wage rates to attract and retain employees, and could negatively affect our ability to efficiently operate our manufacturing facilities and overall business. If we are unable to hire and retain employees capable of performing at a high level, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.17Table of Contents•Our reputation, ability to do business and results of operations may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents, or business partners.While we strive to maintain high standards, we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by our employees, agents, or business partners that would violate the laws of the jurisdictions where we do business, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, anti-kickback and false claims, competition, export and import compliance, environmental compliance, money laundering and data privacy, as well as the improper use of proprietary information or social media. Any such violations of law or improper actions could: subject us to civil or criminal investigations; lead to substantial civil or criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and related shareholder lawsuits; lead to increased costs of compliance; and damage our reputation, our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. •We are subject to risks relating to our existing international operations and expansion into new geographical markets.Approximately 44% and 43% of our revenues for 2023 and 2022, respectively, were derived outside the United States and we expect international sales to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues given our global growth strategy. As a result of our international operations and our global expansion strategy, we are subject to various risks, including:opolitical, social and economic instability and disruptions;ogovernment import and export controls, economic sanctions, embargoes or trade restrictions;othe imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers and retaliatory countermeasures;olimitations on ownership and dividend of earnings;otransportation delays and interruptions;orisk to theft of proprietary information and/or intellectual property;olabor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments;o  widespread public health crises, such as a pandemic or epidemic;oincreased compliance costs, including costs associated with disclosure requirements and related due diligence;othe impact of loss of a single-source manufacturing facility;odifficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations;olimitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies; o  potentially adverse tax consequences; andoaccess to or control of networks and confidential information due to local government controls and vulnerability of local networks to cyber risks.If we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding our global business or adequately manage operational risks of our existing international operations, the risks could have a material adverse effect on our growth in geographic markets, our reputation, our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.•Our operations, businesses, products and business strategy are subject to cybersecurity risks.Although we have several processes and procedures in place designed to manage and mitigate cybersecurity risk, our business is still subject to certain risks. We depend on our own and third party information systems, including cloud-based systems and managed service providers, to store, process and protect our information and support our business activities. We also use third party systems to support employee data processing for our global workforce and to support customer business activities, such as transmitting payment information, providing mobile monitoring services, and capturing operational data. Additionally, some of our products contain integrated hardware and software and offer the ability to connect to networks. While we have measures in place that are designed to protect these systems, these systems have been and are expected to continue to be the target of cyber attacks. Although we conduct security assessments and 18Table of Contentsperiodic re-assessments of third party partners and other service providers, our systems may also experience vulnerabilities from third-party or open source software code that may be incorporated into our own or our vendors’ systems. Any prolonged system disruption in our systems or third-party services could negatively impact the coordination of our sales, planning, and manufacturing activities, which could harm our business.Our business has both an increasing reliance on systems and an increasing digital footprint as a result of changing technologies, connected devices and digital offerings, as well as expanded remote work policies. If these technologies, systems, products or services are damaged, cease to function properly, are compromised due to employee or third-party contractor error, user error, malfeasance, system errors, or other vulnerabilities, or are subject to cybersecurity attacks, such as those involving denial of service attacks, unauthorized access, malicious software, ransomware, or other intrusions, including by criminals, nation states or insiders, our business may be adversely impacted. The impacts could include production downtimes, operational delays, and other impacts on our operations and ability to provide products and services to our customers; compromise of confidential, proprietary or otherwise protected information, including personal information and customer confidential data; destruction, corruption, or theft of data or intellectual property; manipulation, disruption, or improper use of these technologies, systems, products or services; financial losses from fraudulent transactions, remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability; adverse media coverage; legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations, actions and fines; and damage to our reputation. We regularly assess our threat landscape and monitor our systems and other technical security controls, maintain information security policies and procedures, including a breach response plan, ensure maintenance of backup and protective systems, and have a team of security personnel managing our efforts and initiatives. However, there has been a rise in the number of cyberattacks targeting confidential business information generally and in the manufacturing industry specifically, as well as an increase in cyberattacks targeting managed service providers, by both state-sponsored and criminal organizations. Moreover, there has been a rise in the number of cyberattacks that depend on human error or manipulation, including phishing attacks or schemes that use social engineering to gain access to systems or perpetuate wire transfer or other frauds. These trends increase the likelihood of such events occurring as well as the costs associated with protecting against such events. It is possible for vulnerabilities in our systems to remain undetected for an extended period of time up to and including several years. We attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, systems monitoring and other technical security controls, vulnerability scanning, risk assessments, a breach response plan, maintenance of backup and protective systems, and security personnel. Notwithstanding those measures, our systems, networks, products and services remain potentially vulnerable to known or unknown cybersecurity attacks and other threats, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We continuously monitor and develop our systems to protect our technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption. However, a cybersecurity attack could persist for an extended period of time before being detected, and, following detection, it could take considerable time for us to obtain full and reliable information about the extent, amount and type of information compromised. During the course of an investigation, we may not know the full impact of the event and how to remediate it, and actions, decisions and mistakes that are taken or made may further increase the negative effects of the event on our business, results of operations and reputation. While we maintain insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of cybersecurity risks, such insurance coverage may not cover all losses or all types of claims that arise. As cyber threats continue to evolve, cybersecurity and data protection laws and regulations continue to develop in the U.S. and globally, and our business continues to move towards increased online connectivity within our information systems and through more Internet-enabled products and offerings, we expect to expend additional resources to continue to build out our compliance programs, strengthen our information security, data protection and business continuity measures, and investigate and remediate vulnerabilities. For additional information on our cybersecurity risk management, strategy and governance, see Item 1C. ""Cybersecurity.""•Unforeseen developments in contingencies such as litigation and product recalls could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We and certain of our subsidiaries are, and from time to time may become, parties to a number of legal proceedings incidental to our businesses, including alleged injuries arising out of the use of products or exposure to hazardous substances, or claims related to patent infringement, employment matters and commercial disputes. The defense of these lawsuits may require significant expenses and divert management's attention, and we may be required to pay damages that could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, any 19Table of Contentsinsurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures. We may be exposed to product recalls and adverse public relations if our products are alleged to have defects, to cause property damage, to cause injury or illness, or if we are alleged to have violated governmental regulations. A product recall could result in substantial and unexpected expenditures, which would reduce operating profit and cash flow. In addition, a product recall may require significant management attention. Product recalls may hurt the value of our brands and lead to decreased demand for our products. Product recalls also may lead to increased scrutiny by federal, state or international regulatory agencies of our operations and increased litigation and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.•Our revenue, operating profits and cash flows could be adversely affected if our businesses are unable to protect or obtain patent and other intellectual property rights.Our businesses own patents, trademarks, licenses and other forms of intellectual property related to their products and continuously invest in research and development that may result in innovations and general intellectual property rights. Our businesses employ various measures to develop, maintain and protect their intellectual property rights. These measures may not be effective in capturing intellectual property rights, and they may not prevent their intellectual property from being challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected. Unauthorized use of our businesses' intellectual property rights could adversely impact the competitive position of our businesses and could have a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.•We could be negatively impacted by environmental, social and governance (ESG) and sustainability matters.Governments, shareholders, customers, employees and other stakeholders are increasingly focusing on corporate ESG practices and disclosures, and expectations in this area are rapidly evolving and growing. We have announced certain initiatives, including goals, regarding our focus areas, which include greenhouse gas emissions reductions, health and safety, diversity and inclusion, talent attraction and development, and innovation for sustainable products. The criteria by which our ESG practices are assessed may change due to the evolution of the sustainability landscape, which could result in greater expectations of us and may cause us to undertake costly initiatives to satisfy new criteria. Moreover, the increasing attention to sustainability could also result in reduced demand for certain of our products or services and/or reduced profits. If we are unable to respond effectively, investors may conclude that our policies and/or actions with respect to ESG matters are inadequate. If we fail or are perceived to have failed to achieve previously announced initiatives or goals or to accurately disclose our progress on such initiatives or goals, our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.Industry Risks•Increasing product, service and price competition by international and domestic competitors, including new entrants, and our inability to introduce new and competitive products could cause our businesses to generate lower revenue, operating profits and cash flows.Our competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of the products that our businesses manufacture and the markets they serve. In general, most of our businesses compete with only a few companies. Our ability to compete effectively depends on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various competitive factors, including new products, digital solutions and support services that may be introduced by competitors, changes in customer preferences, evolving regulations, new business models and technologies and pricing pressures. If our businesses are unable to anticipate their competitors' developments or identify customer needs and preferences on a timely basis, successfully introduce new products, digital solutions and support services in response to such competitive factors, or adopt to market changes relating to climate change related policies, they could lose customers to competitors. If our businesses do not compete effectively, we may experience lower revenue, operating profits and cash flows.20Table of Contents•Our operating results depend in part on the timely development and commercialization, and customer acceptance, of new and enhanced products, digital solutions and support services based on technological innovation.The success of new and improved products, digital solutions and support services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by our customers. Certain of our businesses sell in markets that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product introductions, changing industry standards and corresponding shifts in customer demand, which may result in unpredictable product transitions, shortened life cycles and increased importance of being first to market. Failure to correctly identify and predict customer needs and preferences, to deliver high quality, innovative and competitive products to the market, to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or to acquire rights to third-party technologies, to provide adequate data security and privacy protections and to stimulate customer demand for, and convince customers to adopt new products, digital solutions and support services could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, we may experience difficulties or delays in the research, development, production or marketing of new products, digital solutions and support services which may prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to continue to bring new products and services to market. •We could lose customers or generate lower revenue, operating profits and cash flows if there are significant increases in the cost of our raw materials or components, or if suppliers are not able to meet our quality and delivery requirements.We purchase raw materials, sub-assemblies and components for use in our manufacturing operations. Factors such as freight costs, transportation availability, inventory levels, the level of imports, the imposition of duties, tariffs and other trade barriers and general economic conditions may affect the price of these raw materials, sub-assemblies and components. Significant price increases for certain commodities, other raw materials or components could adversely affect operating profits of our businesses. While we generally attempt to mitigate the impact of increased raw material prices by hedging or passing along the increased costs to customers, there may be a time delay between the increased raw material prices and the ability to increase the prices of products, or we may be unable to increase the prices of products due to a competitor's pricing pressure or other factors. We use a wide range of raw materials and components in our manufacturing operations that come from numerous suppliers. While we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate, it is difficult to predict what effects of extended lead times or shortages may have in the future. In addition, some of the raw materials and components may be available only from limited or single source suppliers. If a single source or limited source supplier were to cease or interrupt production for any reason or otherwise fail to supply those raw materials or components to us on favorable purchase terms, including at favorable prices, in sufficient quantities and with adequate lead times needed for efficient manufacturing, our ability to meet customer commitments, and satisfy market demands for affected products could be negatively affected. The disruption of our global supply chain for any reason, including for issues such as COVID-19 or other health epidemics or pandemics, labor disputes, loss of single source or limited source supplier, inability to procure sufficient raw materials, quality control issues, ethical sourcing issues, a supplier's financial distress, natural disasters, looting, vandalism or acts of war or terrorism, trade sanctions or other external factors over which we have no control, could interrupt product supply and, if not effectively managed and remedied, have a material adverse impact on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.21Table of ContentsLegal and Regulatory Risks•Our businesses are subject to regulation and their profitability and reputation could be adversely affected by domestic and foreign governmental and public policy changes, risks associated with emerging markets, changes in statutory tax rates and unanticipated outcomes with respect to tax audits.Our businesses' domestic and international sales and operations must comply with a wide variety of laws, regulations and policies (including environmental, employment and health and safety regulations, data security laws, data privacy laws, export/import laws, tax policies such as export subsidy programs and research and experimentation credits, carbon emission regulations, energy efficiency and design regulations and other similar programs). These laws, regulations and policies are complex, change frequently, have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions. Failure to comply (or any alleged or perceived failure to comply) with any of the foregoing could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties as well as potential damage to our reputation and disruption to our business. We cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with new and evolving regulatory reporting requirements and current or future laws will not exceed our estimates. Any of these factors could adversely affect customer demand, our relationships with customers and suppliers, and our business and financial position. Certain of our businesses have sales or operations in countries, including Brazil, India and China, and may in the future invest in other countries, any of which may carry high levels of currency, political, compliance, or economic risk. While these risks or the impact of these risks are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could adversely affect our businesses and reputation. Our effective tax rate is impacted by the mix of earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets and changes in income tax laws. The amount of income taxes and other taxes paid can be adversely impacted by changes in statutory tax rates and laws and are subject to ongoing audits by governmental authorities. If these audits result in assessments different from amounts estimated, then our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows may be adversely affected by unfavorable tax adjustments.Financial and Strategic Risks •Our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on cross-border transactions and the translation of local currency results into U.S. dollars could negatively impact our results of operations.We conduct business through our subsidiaries in many different countries, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a significant impact on our reported consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, which are presented in U.S. dollars. Cross-border transactions, both with external parties and intercompany relationships, result in increased exposure to foreign exchange effects. Accordingly, significant changes in currency exchange rates, particularly the euro, Chinese renminbi (yuan), Swedish krona, pound sterling, Indian rupee, Singapore dollar, Danish krone, and Canadian dollar, could cause fluctuations in the reported results of our businesses' operations that could negatively affect our results of operations. Additionally, the strengthening of certain currencies such as the euro and U.S. dollar potentially exposes us to competitive threats from lower cost producers in other countries. Our sales are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign locations are translated into U.S. dollars.22Table of Contents•Our growth and results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in our capital allocation and acquisition program.   We expect to continue our strategy of seeking to acquire value creating add-on businesses that broaden our existing position and global reach as well as, in the right circumstances, strategically pursue larger acquisitions that could have the potential to either complement our existing businesses or allow us to pursue a new platform. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase, that we will be able to acquire such businesses on acceptable terms, or that all closing conditions will be satisfied with respect to any pending acquisition. In addition, we face the risk that a completed acquisition may underperform relative to expectations. We may not achieve the synergies originally anticipated, may become exposed to unexpected liabilities or may not be able to sufficiently integrate completed acquisitions into our current business and growth model. Further, if we fail to allocate our capital appropriately, in respect of either our acquisition program or organic growth in our operations, we could be overexposed in certain markets and geographies and unable to expand into adjacent products or markets. These factors could potentially have an adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.•The indemnification provisions of acquisition and disposition agreements by which we have acquired or sold or disposed of companies may not fully protect us and may result in unexpected liabilities.Certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of those companies before we acquired them. In most of these agreements, however, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. Similarly, the purchasers of our disposed operations may from time to time agree to indemnify us for operations of such businesses after the closing. We cannot be assured that any of these indemnification provisions will fully protect us, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, we have retained certain liabilities directly or through indemnifications made to the buyers of businesses we have sold or disposed against known and unknown contingent liabilities such as tax liabilities and environmental matters. There can be no assurance that the indemnity agreements will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of any liabilities that may arise, or that the indemnitors will be able to fully satisfy their indemnification obligations. The failure to receive amounts for which we are entitled to indemnification could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition"
0,DOV,DOVER CORP,2023-02-10,"ITEM 1A.   RISK FACTORSThe risk factors discussed in this section should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this Form 10-K and should not be considered the only risks to which we are exposed. In general, we are subject to the same general risks and uncertainties that impact many other industrial companies such as general economic, industry and/or market conditions and growth rates; the impact of natural disasters and their effect on global markets; and changes in laws or accounting rules. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our businesses, including our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Business and Operational Risks•The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and continues to pose risks to, our businesses, the nature and extent of which are highly uncertain and unpredictable.The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the global economy and adversely impacted our businesses, including demand for our products across multiple end-markets as well as our supply chain and operations. While we have experienced sequentially improving activity in most markets and geographies, the public health situation, global response measures and corresponding impacts on various markets remain fluid and uncertain and may lead to sudden changes in trajectory and outlook. Accordingly, we are currently unable to quantify the full and long-term impact of the pandemic on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.We have taken and will continue to take steps to mitigate the risks of COVID-19 by working with our customers, employees, suppliers and other stakeholders. The emergence of new variants of COVID-19, evolving government plans around the world to institute vaccination mandates, including in the U.S., and limited availability of vaccines in various jurisdictions, create uncertainty that may impact our employees and result in labor shortages and unforeseen costs. We cannot predict the potential for operating at reduced capacity or the size of the workforce that may be impacted by potential labor actions such as furloughs or layoffs. In addition, the uncertain recovery in demand has had business impacts, including increased material cost inflation (principally steel), labor availability issues and logistics costs increases. Some of our businesses have also been impacted from supplier component input availability issues.The extent to which our operations may be impacted by COVID-19 will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain, including the pandemic's duration, the emergence of different COVID-19 variants, the efficacy and adoption rates of vaccines, the availability of oral medicines and actions by governments and private enterprises to contain the outbreak or mitigate the impact of the pandemic. For example, applicable laws and government measures, such as U.S. federal vaccine mandates or Occupational Safety and Health Administration requirements for vaccination or regular testing, could also result in skilled labor impacts including voluntary attrition or difficulty finding labor or otherwise adversely affect our ability to operate our facilities, obtain materials and component inputs from suppliers or deliver our products in a timely manner.Furthermore, the pandemic has impacted and may further impact the broader economies of affected countries, including negatively impacting economic growth, the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Due to the continuing uncertainties surrounding the pandemic, we are unable to determine the impact that it will have on our financial position, operating results and cash flows in future periods.•Recessions, adverse market conditions or downturns in the markets we serve could adversely affect our operations.In the past, our operations have been exposed to volatility due to changes in general economic conditions or consumer preferences, recessions or adverse conditions in the markets we serve. In the future, similar changes could adversely impact overall sales, operating results (including potential impairment charges for goodwill or other long-lived assets) and cash flows. Moreover, during economic downturns we may undertake more extensive restructuring actions, including workforce reductions, global facility consolidations, centralization of certain business support activities, and other cost reduction initiatives, and incur higher costs. As these plans and actions can be complex, the anticipated operational improvements, efficiencies and other benefits might be delayed or not realized. We are unable to determine 16Table of Contentsthe impact that recessions, adverse market conditions or downturns will have on our financial position, operating results and cash flows in future periods.•Increases in labor costs, potential labor disputes and work stoppages or an inability to hire skilled personnel could adversely affect our business.We have a number of collective bargaining units in the U.S. and various collective labor arrangements outside the U.S. We are subject to potential work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes, any of which could adversely impact our productivity, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Furthermore, the competition for skilled personnel is often intense in the regions in which our manufacturing facilities are located. A sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our employee base, increases in the salaries and wages paid by competing employers, as a result of general macroeconomic factors or otherwise, could lead to increased costs, such as increased overtime to meet demand and potentially further increase salaries and wage rates to attract and retain employees, and could negatively affect our ability to efficiently operate our manufacturing facilities and overall business. If we are unable to hire and retain employees capable of performing at a high level, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.•Our reputation, ability to do business and results of operations may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents, or business partners.While we strive to maintain high standards, we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by our employees, agents, or business partners that would violate the laws of the jurisdictions where we do business, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, anti-kickback and false claims, competition, export and import compliance, environmental compliance, money laundering and data privacy, as well as the improper use of proprietary information or social media. Any such violations of law or improper actions could: subject us to civil or criminal investigations; lead to substantial civil or criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and related shareholder lawsuits; lead to increased costs of compliance; and damage our reputation, our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 17Table of Contents•We are subject to risks relating to our existing international operations and expansion into new geographical markets.Approximately 43% and 46% of our revenues for 2022 and 2021, respectively, were derived outside the United States and we expect international sales to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues given our global growth strategy. As a result of our international operations and our global expansion strategy, we are subject to various risks, including:opolitical, social and economic instability and disruptions;ogovernment import and export controls, economic sanctions, embargoes or trade restrictions;othe imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers and retaliatory countermeasures;olimitations on ownership and dividend of earnings;otransportation delays and interruptions;orisk to theft of proprietary information and/or intellectual property;olabor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments;o  widespread public health crises, such as a pandemic or epidemic;oincreased compliance costs, including costs associated with disclosure requirements and related due diligence;othe impact of loss of a single-source manufacturing facility;odifficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations;olimitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies; o  potentially adverse tax consequences; andoaccess to or control of networks and confidential information due to local government controls and vulnerability of local networks to cyber risks.If we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding our global business or adequately manage operational risks of our existing international operations, the risks could have a material adverse effect on our growth in geographic markets, our reputation, our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.•Our operations, businesses and products are subject to cybersecurity risks.We depend on our own and third party IT systems, including cloud-based systems and managed service providers, to store, process and protect our information and support our business activities. We also use third party IT systems to support employee data processing for our global workforce and to support customer business activities, such as transmitting payment information, providing mobile monitoring services, and capturing operational data. Additionally, some of our products contain computer hardware and software and offer the ability to connect to computer networks. Increasingly, our customers, including government customers, are requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards for our products. Our business has both an increasing reliance on IT systems and an increasing digital footprint as a result of changing technologies, connected devices and digital offerings, as well as expanded remote work policies. If these technologies, systems, products or services are damaged, cease to function properly, are compromised due to employee or third-party contractor error, user error, malfeasance, system errors, or other vulnerabilities, or are subject to cybersecurity attacks, such as those involving denial of service attacks, unauthorized access, malicious software, or other intrusions, including by criminals, nation states or insiders, our business may be adversely impacted. The impacts could include production downtimes, operational delays, and other impacts on our operations and ability to provide products and services to our customers; compromise of confidential, proprietary or otherwise protected information, including personal information and customer confidential data; destruction, corruption, or theft of data or intellectual property; manipulation, disruption, or improper use of these technologies, systems, products or services; financial losses from fraudulent transactions, remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability; adverse media coverage; and legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations, actions and fines; and damage to our reputation. There has been a rise in the number of cyberattacks targeting confidential business information generally and in the manufacturing industry specifically, as well as an increase in cyberattacks targeting managed service providers, by both state-sponsored and criminal organizations. Moreover, there has been a rise in the number of 18Table of Contentscyberattacks that depend on human error or manipulation, including phishing attacks or schemes that use social engineering to gain access to systems or perpetuate wire transfer or other frauds. These trends increase the likelihood of such events occurring as well as the costs associated with protecting against such attacks. It is possible for vulnerabilities in our IT systems to remain undetected for an extended period of time up to and including several years. We attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, systems monitoring and other technical security controls, a breach response plan, maintenance of backup and protective systems, and security personnel. Notwithstanding those measures, our systems, networks, products and services remain potentially vulnerable to known or unknown cybersecurity attacks and other threats, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We, and the service providers that we depend on to support our systems and business operations, are regularly the target of, and periodically respond to, cyberattacks, including phishing and denial-of-service attacks, and must continuously monitor and develop our systems to protect our technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption. In addition, a cybersecurity attack could persist for an extended period of time before being detected, and, following detection, it could take considerable time for us to obtain full and reliable information about the extent, amount and type of information compromised. During the course of an investigation, we may not know the full impact of the event and how to remediate it, and actions, decisions and mistakes that are taken or made may further increase the negative effects of the event on our business, results of operations and reputation. While we maintain insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of cybersecurity risks, such insurance coverage may not cover all losses or all types of claims that arise. As cyber threats continue to evolve, cybersecurity and data protection laws and regulations continue to develop in the U.S. and globally, and our business continues to move towards increased online connectivity within our information systems and through more Internet-enabled products and offerings, we expect to expend additional resources to continue to build out our compliance programs, strengthen our information security, data protection and business continuity measures, and investigate and remediate vulnerabilities.•Unforeseen developments in contingencies such as litigation and product recalls could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We and certain of our subsidiaries are, and from time to time may become, parties to a number of legal proceedings incidental to our businesses, including alleged injuries arising out of the use of products or exposure to hazardous substances, or claims related to patent infringement, employment matters and commercial disputes. The defense of these lawsuits may require significant expenses and divert management's attention, and we may be required to pay damages that could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures. We may be exposed to product recalls and adverse public relations if our products are alleged to have defects, to cause property damage, to cause injury or illness, or if we are alleged to have violated governmental regulations. A product recall could result in substantial and unexpected expenditures, which would reduce operating profit and cash flow. In addition, a product recall may require significant management attention. Product recalls may hurt the value of our brands and lead to decreased demand for our products. Product recalls also may lead to increased scrutiny by federal, state or international regulatory agencies of our operations and increased litigation and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.•Our revenue, operating profits and cash flows could be adversely affected if our businesses are unable to protect or obtain patent and other intellectual property rights.Our businesses own patents, trademarks, licenses and other forms of intellectual property related to their products and continuously invest in research and development that may result in innovations and general intellectual property rights. Our businesses employ various measures to develop, maintain and protect their intellectual property rights. These measures may not be effective in capturing intellectual property rights, and they may not prevent their intellectual property from being challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected. Unauthorized use of our businesses' intellectual property rights could adversely impact the competitive position of our businesses and could have a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.19Table of Contents•We could be negatively impacted by environmental, social and governance (ESG) and sustainability matters.Governments, shareholders, customers, employees and other stakeholders are increasingly focusing on corporate ESG practices and disclosures, and expectations in this area are rapidly evolving and growing. We have announced certain initiatives, including goals, regarding our focus areas, which include greenhouse gas emissions reductions, health and safety, diversity and inclusion, talent attraction and development, and innovation for sustainable products. The criteria by which our ESG practices are assessed may change due to the evolution of the sustainability landscape, which could result in greater expectations of us and may cause us to undertake costly initiatives to satisfy new criteria. Moreover, the increasing attention to sustainability could also result in reduced demand for certain of our products or services and/or reduced profits. If we are unable to respond effectively, investors may conclude that our policies and/or actions with respect to ESG matters are inadequate. If we fail or are perceived to have failed to achieve previously announced initiatives or goals or to accurately disclose our progress on such initiatives or goals, our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.Industry Risks•Increasing product, service and price competition by international and domestic competitors, including new entrants, and our inability to introduce new and competitive products could cause our businesses to generate lower revenue, operating profits and cash flows.Our competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of the products that our businesses manufacture and the markets they serve. In general, most of our businesses compete with only a few companies. Our ability to compete effectively depends on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various competitive factors, including new products, digital solutions and support services that may be introduced by competitors, changes in customer preferences, evolving regulations, new business models and technologies and pricing pressures. If our businesses are unable to anticipate their competitors' developments or identify customer needs and preferences on a timely basis, successfully introduce new products, digital solutions and support services in response to such competitive factors, or adopt to market changes relating to climate change related policies, they could lose customers to competitors. If our businesses do not compete effectively, we may experience lower revenue, operating profits and cash flows.•Our operating results depend in part on the timely development and commercialization, and customer acceptance, of new and enhanced products, digital solutions and support services based on technological innovation.The success of new and improved products, digital solutions and support services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by our customers. Certain of our businesses sell in markets that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product introductions, changing industry standards and corresponding shifts in customer demand, which may result in unpredictable product transitions, shortened life cycles and increased importance of being first to market. Failure to correctly identify and predict customer needs and preferences, to deliver high quality, innovative and competitive products to the market, to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or to acquire rights to third-party technologies, to provide adequate data security and privacy protections and to stimulate customer demand for, and convince customers to adopt new products, digital solutions and support services could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, we may experience difficulties or delays in the research, development, production or marketing of new products, digital solutions and support services which may prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to continue to bring new products and services to market. •We could lose customers or generate lower revenue, operating profits and cash flows if there are significant increases in the cost of our raw materials or components, or if suppliers are not able to meet our quality and delivery requirements.We purchase raw materials, sub-assemblies and components for use in our manufacturing operations. Factors such as freight costs, transportation availability, inventory levels, the level of imports, the imposition of duties, tariffs and other trade barriers and general economic conditions may affect the price of these raw materials, sub-assemblies and components. Significant price increases for certain commodities, other raw materials or components could adversely affect operating profits of our businesses. While we generally attempt to mitigate the impact of increased raw material prices by hedging or passing along the increased costs to customers, there may be a time delay between the increased raw 20Table of Contentsmaterial prices and the ability to increase the prices of products, or we may be unable to increase the prices of products due to a competitor's pricing pressure or other factors. We use a wide range of raw materials and components in our manufacturing operations that come from numerous suppliers. While we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate, it is difficult to predict what effects of extended lead times or shortages may have in the future. In addition, some of the raw materials and components may be available only from limited or single source suppliers. If a single source or limited source supplier were to cease or interrupt production for any reason or otherwise fail to supply those raw materials or components to us on favorable purchase terms, including at favorable prices, in sufficient quantities and with adequate lead times needed for efficient manufacturing, our ability to meet customer commitments, and satisfy market demands for affected products could be negatively affected. The disruption of our global supply chain for any reason, including for issues such as COVID-19 or other health epidemics or pandemics, labor disputes, loss of single source or limited source supplier, inability to procure sufficient raw materials, quality control issues, ethical sourcing issues, a supplier's financial distress, natural disasters, looting, vandalism or acts of war or terrorism, trade sanctions or other external factors over which we have no control, could interrupt product supply and, if not effectively managed and remedied, have a material adverse impact on our business operations, financial condition and results of operations.Legal and Regulatory Risks•Our businesses are subject to regulation and their profitability and reputation could be adversely affected by domestic and foreign governmental and public policy changes, risks associated with emerging markets, changes in statutory tax rates and unanticipated outcomes with respect to tax audits.Our businesses' domestic and international sales and operations must comply with a wide variety of laws, regulations and policies (including environmental, employment and health and safety regulations, data security laws, data privacy laws, export/import laws, tax policies such as export subsidy programs and research and experimentation credits, carbon emission regulations, energy efficiency and design regulations and other similar programs). These laws, regulations and policies are complex, change frequently, have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions. Failure to comply (or any alleged or perceived failure to comply) with any of the foregoing could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties as well as potential damage to our reputation and disruption to our business. We cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with new and evolving regulatory reporting requirements and current or future laws will not exceed our estimates. Any of these factors could adversely affect customer demand, our relationships with customers and suppliers, and our business and financial position. Certain of our businesses have sales or operations in countries, including Brazil, India and China, and may in the future invest in other countries, any of which may carry high levels of currency, political, compliance, or economic risk. While these risks or the impact of these risks are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could adversely affect our businesses and reputation. Our effective tax rate is impacted by the mix of earnings among countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets and changes in income tax laws. The amount of income taxes and other taxes paid can be adversely impacted by changes in statutory tax rates and laws and are subject to ongoing audits by governmental authorities. If these audits result in assessments different from amounts estimated, then our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows may be adversely affected by unfavorable tax adjustments.Financial and Strategic Risks •Our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on cross-border transactions and the translation of local currency results into U.S. dollars could negatively impact our results of operations.We conduct business through our subsidiaries in many different countries, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a significant impact on our reported consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, which are presented in U.S. dollars. Cross-border transactions, both with external parties and intercompany relationships, result in increased exposure to foreign exchange effects. Accordingly, significant changes in currency exchange rates, particularly the euro, Chinese renminbi (yuan), Swedish krona, pound sterling, Indian rupee, Singapore dollar, Danish krone, and Canadian dollar, could cause fluctuations in the reported results of our businesses' operations that could 21Table of Contentsnegatively affect our results of operations. Additionally, the strengthening of certain currencies such as the euro and U.S. dollar potentially exposes us to competitive threats from lower cost producers in other countries. Our sales are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign locations are translated into U.S. dollars.•Our growth and results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in our capital allocation and acquisition program.   We expect to continue our strategy of seeking to acquire value creating add-on businesses that broaden our existing position and global reach as well as, in the right circumstances, strategically pursue larger acquisitions that could have the potential to either complement our existing businesses or allow us to pursue a new platform. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase, that we will be able to acquire such businesses on acceptable terms, or that all closing conditions will be satisfied with respect to any pending acquisition. In addition, we face the risk that a completed acquisition may underperform relative to expectations. We may not achieve the synergies originally anticipated, may become exposed to unexpected liabilities or may not be able to sufficiently integrate completed acquisitions into our current business and growth model. Further, if we fail to allocate our capital appropriately, in respect of either our acquisition program or organic growth in our operations, we could be overexposed in certain markets and geographies and unable to expand into adjacent products or markets. These factors could potentially have an adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.•The indemnification provisions of acquisition and disposition agreements by which we have acquired or sold or disposed of companies may not fully protect us and may result in unexpected liabilities.Certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of those companies before we acquired them. In most of these agreements, however, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. Similarly, the purchasers of our disposed operations may from time to time agree to indemnify us for operations of such businesses after the closing. We cannot be assured that any of these indemnification provisions will fully protect us, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, we have retained certain liabilities directly or through indemnifications made to the buyers of businesses we have sold or disposed against known and unknown contingent liabilities such as tax liabilities and environmental matters. There can be no assurance that the indemnity agreements will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of any liabilities that may arise, or that the indemnitors will be able to fully satisfy their indemnification obligations. The failure to receive amounts for which we are entitled to indemnification could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition"
10,DOV,DOVER CORP,2022-02-11,"ITEM 1A.   RISK FACTORSThe risk factors discussed in this section should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this Form 10-K and should not be considered the only risks to which we are exposed. In general, we are subject to the same general risks and uncertainties that impact many other industrial companies such as general economic, industry and/or market conditions and growth rates; the impact of natural disasters and their effect on global markets; and changes in laws or accounting rules. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our businesses, including our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Business and Operational Risks•The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and continues to pose risks to, our businesses, the nature and extent of which are highly uncertain and unpredictable.The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the global economy and adversely impacted our businesses, including demand for our products across multiple end-markets as well as our supply chain and operations. While we have experienced sequentially improving activity in most markets and geographies, the public health situation, global response measures and corresponding impacts on various markets remain fluid and uncertain and may lead to sudden changes in trajectory and outlook. Accordingly, we are currently unable to quantify the full and long-term impact of the pandemic on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.We have taken and will continue to take steps to mitigate the risks of COVID-19 by working with our customers, employees, suppliers and other stakeholders. Significant portions of our workforce and operations have been impacted by quarantines, government orders and guidance, facility closures, illness, travel restrictions, implementation of precautionary measures and other restrictions. Over the course of the pandemic, we have continued to operate in accordance with established health and safety protocols across our facilities while maintaining an enhanced health and safety compliance program. More specifically, we have modified practices at our manufacturing locations and offices to adhere to guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local health and governmental authorities in our global network with respect to social distancing, physical separation, personal protective equipment and sanitization, and have restricted the number of employees permitted in common areas at any given time. The emergence of new variants of COVID-19, evolving government plans around the world to institute vaccination mandates, including in the U.S., and limited availability of vaccines in various jurisdictions, create uncertainty that may impact our employees and result in labor shortages and unforeseen costs. In addition, because the pandemic has decreased customer demand in many of our end-markets, some of our businesses have continued to operate at reduced capacity. We cannot predict the number or timing of any future facility closures, the potential for operating at reduced capacity or the size of the workforce that may be impacted by potential labor actions such as furloughs or layoffs. The extent to which our operations may be impacted by COVID-19 will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain, including the pandemic's duration, the emergence of different COVID-19 variants, the efficacy and adoption rates of vaccines, the availability of recently approved oral medicines and actions by governments and private enterprises to contain the outbreak or mitigate the impact of the pandemic. For example, applicable laws and government measures, such as U.S. federal vaccine mandates or Occupational Safety and Health Administration requirements for vaccination or regular testing, could also result in skilled labor impacts including voluntary attrition or difficulty finding labor or otherwise adversely affect our ability to operate our facilities, obtain materials and component inputs from suppliers or deliver our products in a timely manner.  Furthermore, the pandemic has impacted and may further impact the broader economies of affected countries, including negatively impacting economic growth, the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates.  Due to the continuing uncertainties surrounding the pandemic, we are unable to predict the ultimate impact that it will have on our financial position, operating results and cash flows in future periods.16Table of Contents•Increases in labor costs, potential labor disputes and work stoppages or an inability to hire skilled personnel could adversely affect our business.We have a number of collective bargaining units in the U.S. and various collective labor arrangements outside the U.S. We are subject to potential work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes, any of which could adversely impact our productivity, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Furthermore, the competition for skilled personnel is often intense in the regions in which our manufacturing facilities are located. A sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our employee base, increases in the salaries and wages paid by competing employers, as a result of general macroeconomic factors or otherwise, could lead to increased costs, such as increased overtime to meet demand and potentially further increase salaries and wage rates to attract and retain employees, and could negatively affect our ability to efficiently operate our manufacturing facilities and overall business. If we are unable to hire and retain employees capable of performing at a high level, our business, financial condition and results of of operations could be adversely affected.•Our reputation, ability to do business and results of operations may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents, or business partners.While we strive to maintain high standards, we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by our employees, agents, or business partners that would violate the laws of the jurisdictions where we do business, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, anti-kickback and false claims, competition, export and import compliance, environmental compliance, money laundering and data privacy, as well as the improper use of proprietary information or social media. Any such violations of law or improper actions could: subject us to civil or criminal investigations; lead to substantial civil or criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and related shareholder lawsuits; lead to increased costs of compliance; and damage our reputation, our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. 17Table of Contents•We are subject to risks relating to our existing international operations and expansion into new geographical markets.Approximately 46% and 45% of our revenues for 2021 and 2020, respectively, were derived outside the United States and we expect international sales to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues given our global growth strategy. As a result of our international operations and our global expansion strategy, we are subject to various risks, including:opolitical, social and economic instability and disruptions;ogovernment import and export controls, economic sanctions, embargoes or trade restrictions;othe imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers and retaliatory countermeasures;olimitations on ownership and dividend of earnings;otransportation delays and interruptions;olabor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments;o  widespread public health crises, such as a pandemic or epidemic;oincreased compliance costs, including costs associated with disclosure requirements and related due diligence;othe impact of loss of a single-source manufacturing facility;odifficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations;olimitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies; o  potentially adverse tax consequences; andoaccess to or control of networks and confidential information due to local government controls and vulnerability of local networks to cyber risks.If we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding our global business or adequately manage operational risks of our existing international operations, the risks could have a material adverse effect on our growth in geographic markets, our reputation, our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.•Our operations, businesses and products are subject to cybersecurity risks.  We depend on our own and third party IT systems, including cloud-based systems and managed service providers, to store, process and protect our information and support our business activities. We also use third party IT systems to support employee data processing for our global workforce and to support customer business activities, such as transmitting payment information, providing mobile monitoring services, and capturing operational data. Additionally, some of our products contain computer hardware and software and offer the ability to connect to computer networks. Increasingly, our customers, including government customers, are requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards for our products. Our business has both an increasing reliance on IT systems and an increasing digital footprint as a result of changing technologies, connected devices and digital offerings, as well as expanded remote work policies. If these technologies, systems, products or services are damaged, cease to function properly, are compromised due to employee or third-party contractor error, user error, malfeasance, system errors, or other vulnerabilities, or are subject to cybersecurity attacks, such as those involving denial of service attacks, unauthorized access, malicious software, or other intrusions, including by criminals, nation states or insiders, our business may be adversely impacted. The impacts could include production downtimes, operational delays, and other impacts on our operations and ability to provide products and services to our customers; compromise of confidential, proprietary or otherwise protected information, including personal information and customer confidential data; destruction, corruption, or theft of data or intellectual property; manipulation, disruption, or improper use of these technologies, systems, products or services; financial losses from fraudulent transactions, remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability; adverse media coverage; and legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations, actions and fines; and damage to our reputation. There has been a rise in the number of cyberattacks targeting confidential business information generally and in the manufacturing industry specifically, as well as an increase in cyberattacks targeting managed service providers, by both state-sponsored and criminal organizations. Moreover, there has been a rise in the number of 18Table of Contentscyberattacks that depend on human error or manipulation, including phishing attacks or schemes that use social engineering to gain access to systems or perpetuate wire transfer or other frauds. These trends increase the likelihood of such events occurring as well as the costs associated with protecting against such attacks. It is possible for vulnerabilities in our IT systems to remain undetected for an extended period of time up to and including several years. We attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, systems monitoring and other technical security controls, a breach response plan, maintenance of backup and protective systems, and security personnel. Notwithstanding those measures, our systems, networks, products and services remain potentially vulnerable to known or unknown cybersecurity attacks and other threats, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We, and the service providers that we depend on to support our systems and business operations, are regularly the target of, and periodically respond to, cyberattacks, including phishing and denial-of-service attacks, and must continuously monitor and develop our systems to protect our technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption. In addition, a cybersecurity attack could persist for an extended period of time before being detected, and, following detection, it could take considerable time for us to obtain full and reliable information about the extent, amount and type of information compromised. During the course of an investigation, we may not know the full impact of the event and how to remediate it, and actions, decisions and mistakes that are taken or made may further increase the negative effects of the event on our business, results of operations and reputation. While we maintain insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of cybersecurity risks, such insurance coverage may not cover all losses or all types of claims that arise. As cyber threats continue to evolve, cybersecurity and data protection laws and regulations continue to develop in the U.S. and globally, and our business continues to move towards increased online connectivity within our information systems and through more Internet-enabled products and offerings, we expect to expend additional resources to continue to build out our compliance programs, strengthen our information security, data protection and business continuity measures, and investigate and remediate vulnerabilities.•Unforeseen developments in contingencies such as litigation and product recalls could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We and certain of our subsidiaries are, and from time to time may become, parties to a number of legal proceedings incidental to our businesses, including alleged injuries arising out of the use of products or exposure to hazardous substances, or claims related to patent infringement, employment matters and commercial disputes. The defense of these lawsuits may require significant expenses and divert management’s attention, and we may be required to pay damages that could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures. We may be exposed to product recalls and adverse public relations if our products are alleged to have defects, to cause property damage, to cause injury or illness, or if we are alleged to have violated governmental regulations. A product recall could result in substantial and unexpected expenditures, which would reduce operating profit and cash flow. In addition, a product recall may require significant management attention. Product recalls may hurt the value of our brands and lead to decreased demand for our products. Product recalls also may lead to increased scrutiny by federal, state or international regulatory agencies of our operations and increased litigation and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.•Our revenue, operating profits and cash flows could be adversely affected if our businesses are unable to protect or obtain patent and other intellectual property rights.Our businesses own patents, trademarks, licenses and other forms of intellectual property related to their products and continuously invest in research and development that may result in innovations and general intellectual property rights.

13,DOV,DOVER CORP,2021-02-12,"ITEM 1A.   RISK FACTORSThe risk factors discussed in this section should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this Form 10-K and should not be considered the only risks to which we are exposed. In general, we are subject to the same general risks and uncertainties that impact many other industrial companies such as general economic, industry and/or market conditions and growth rates; the impact of natural disasters and their effect on global markets; and changes in laws or accounting rules. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business, including our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Business and Operational Risks•The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and poses risks to, our business, the nature and extent of which are highly uncertain and unpredictable.The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the global economy and adversely impacted our business, including demand for our products across multiple end-markets as well as our supply chain and operations. While we have experienced sequentially improving activity in most markets and geographies, the public health situation, global response measures and corresponding impacts on various markets remain fluid and uncertain and may lead to sudden changes in trajectory and outlook. Accordingly, we are currently unable to quantify the full and long-term impact of the pandemic on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.We are monitoring the global outbreak of COVID-19 and taking steps to mitigate its risks by working with our customers, employees, suppliers and other stakeholders. Significant portions of our workforce and operations have been impacted by quarantines, government orders and guidance, facility closures, illness, travel restrictions, implementation of precautionary measures and other restrictions. Over the course of the pandemic, we have continued to operate in accordance with established health and safety protocols across our facilities while maintaining an enhanced health and safety compliance program. More specifically, we have modified practices at our manufacturing locations and offices to adhere to guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and local health and governmental authorities in our global network with respect to social distancing, physical separation, personal protective equipment and sanitization, and have restricted the number of employees permitted in common areas at any given time. Further actions may be required as conditions evolve, including if new waves of infection emerge in various parts of the globe or until a vaccine is widely available. In addition, because the pandemic has decreased customer demand in many of our end-markets, some of our businesses have continued to operate at reduced capacity. We cannot predict the number or timing of any future facility closures, the potential for operating at reduced capacity or the size of the workforce that may be impacted by potential labor actions such as furloughs or layoffs. The COVID-19 pandemic has the potential to disrupt our supply chain as a result of shifts in demand, illness, quarantine, travel restrictions or financial hardship. We have been able to procure the critical raw materials and components necessary to continue production of our products, but there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so in the future. In addition, we may experience additional adverse impacts on our operational and commercial activities, costs, customer orders and purchases and our collections of accounts receivable, which may be material, and the extent of these adverse impacts on future operational and commercial activities, costs, customer orders and purchases and our collections remains uncertain even if conditions begin to improve. Furthermore, the pandemic has impacted and may further impact the broader economies of affected countries, including negatively impacting economic growth, the proper functioning of financial and capital markets, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. Due to the unprecedented and sustained social and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy generally, there is uncertainty around its duration and the timing of recovery. The ultimate significance of the COVID-19 pandemic, including any measures to reduce its spread, on our business will depend on events that are beyond our control and that we cannot predict and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.15Table of Contents•We are subject to risks relating to our existing international operations and expansion into new geographical markets.In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic had a greater impact on revenue from international markets compared to the United States, resulting in a greater rate of decline. As a result, approximately 45% of our revenues for 2020 as compared to approximately 47% in 2019 were derived outside the United States. This was mostly in Europe and China.  We will continue to focus on global markets as part of our overall growth strategy and expect sales from outside the United States to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues. Our international operations and our global expansion strategy are subject to general risks related to such operations, including:opolitical, social and economic instability and disruptions;ogovernment import and export controls, economic sanctions, embargoes or trade restrictions;othe imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers and retaliatory countermeasures;olimitations on ownership and dividend of earnings;otransportation delays and interruptions;olabor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments;o  widespread public health crises, such as a pandemic or epidemic;oincreased compliance costs, including costs associated with disclosure requirements and related due diligence;othe impact of loss of a single-source manufacturing facility;odifficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations;olimitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies; o  potentially adverse tax consequences; andoaccess to or control of networks and confidential information due to local government controls and vulnerability of local networks to cyber risks.If we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding our global business or adequately manage operational risks of our existing international operations, the risks could have a material adverse effect on our growth in geographic markets, our reputation, our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.•Our operations, businesses and products are subject to cybersecurity risks.  We depend on our own and third party IT systems, including cloud-based systems and managed service providers, to store, process and protect our information and support our business activities. We also use our third party IT systems to support employee data processing for our global work force and to support customer business activities, such as transmitting payment information, providing mobile monitoring services, and capturing operational data. Additionally, some of our products contain computer hardware and software and offer the ability to connect to computer networks. Increasingly, our customers, including government customers, are requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards for our products. Our business has both an increasing reliance on IT systems and an increasing digital footprint as a result of changing technologies, connected devices and digital offerings, as well as expanded remote work policies. If these technologies, systems, products or services are damaged, cease to function properly, are compromised due to employee or third-party contractor error, user error, malfeasance, system errors, or other vulnerabilities, or are subject to cybersecurity attacks, such as those involving denial of service attacks, unauthorized access, malicious software, or other intrusions, including by criminals, nation states or insiders, our business may be adversely impacted. The impacts could include production downtimes, operational delays, and other impacts on our operations and ability to provide products and services to our customers; compromise of confidential, proprietary or otherwise protected information, including personal information and customer confidential data; destruction, corruption, or theft of data or intellectual property; manipulation, disruption, or improper use of these technologies, systems, products or services; financial losses from fraudulent transactions, remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability; adverse media coverage; and legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations, actions and fines; and damage to our reputation. There has been a rise in the number of cyberattacks targeting confidential business information 16Table of Contentsgenerally and in the manufacturing industry specifically, as well as an increase in cyberattacks targeting managed service providers, by both state-sponsored and criminal organizations. Moreover, there has been a rise in the number of cyberattacks that depend on human error or manipulation, including phishing attacks or schemes that use social engineering to gain access to systems or perpetuate wire transfer or other frauds. These trends increase the likelihood of such events occurring as well as the costs associated with protecting against such attacks. It is possible for vulnerabilities in our IT systems to remain undetected for an extended period of time up to and including several years. We attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, systems monitoring and other technical security controls, a breach response plan, maintenance of backup and protective systems, and security personnel. Not withstanding those measures, our systems, networks, products and services remain potentially vulnerable to known or unknown cybersecurity attacks and other threats, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We, and the service providers that we depend on to support our systems and business operations, are regularly the target of, and periodically respond to,  cyberattacks, including phishing and denial-of-service attacks, and must continuously monitor and develop our systems to protect our technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption.  In addition, a cybersecurity attack could persist for an extended period of time before being detected, and, following detection, it could take considerable time for us to obtain full and reliable information about the extent, amount and type of information compromised. During the course of an investigation, we may not know the full impact of the event and how to remediate it, and actions, decisions and mistakes that are taken or made may further increase the negative effects of the event on our business, results of operations and reputation. While we maintain insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of cybersecurity risks, such insurance coverage may not cover all losses or all types of claims that arise. As cyber threats continue to evolve, cybersecurity and data protection laws and regulations continue to develop in the U.S. and globally, and our business continues to move towards increased online connectivity within our information systems and through more Internet-enabled products and offerings, we expect to expend additional resources to continue to build out our compliance programs, strengthen our information security, data protection and business continuity measures, and investigate and remediate vulnerabilities.•Unforeseen developments in contingencies such as litigation and product recalls could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We and certain of our subsidiaries are, and from time to time may become, parties to a number of legal proceedings incidental to our businesses, including alleged injuries arising out of the use of products or exposure to hazardous substances, or claims related to patent infringement, employment matters and commercial disputes. The defense of these lawsuits may require significant expenses and divert management’s attention, and we may be required to pay damages that could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures. We may be exposed to product recalls and adverse public relations if our products are alleged to have defects, to cause property damage, to cause injury or illness, or if we are alleged to have violated governmental regulations. A product recall could result in substantial and unexpected expenditures, which would reduce operating profit and cash flow. In addition, a product recall may require significant management attention. Product recalls may hurt the value of our brands and lead to decreased demand for our products. Product recalls also may lead to increased scrutiny by federal, state or international regulatory agencies of our operations and increased litigation and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.17Table of Contents•Our revenue, operating profits and cash flows could be adversely affected if our businesses are unable to protect or obtain patent and other intellectual property rights.Our businesses own patents, trademarks, licenses and other forms of intellectual property related to their products and continuously invest in research and development that may result in innovations and general intellectual property rights. Our businesses employ various measures to develop, maintain and protect their intellectual property rights. These measures may not be effective in capturing intellectual property rights, and they may not prevent their intellectual property from being challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected. Unauthorized use of our businesses' intellectual property rights could adversely impact the competitive position of our businesses and could have a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Industry Risks•Increasing product/service and price competition by international and domestic competitors, including new entrants, and our inability to introduce new and competitive products could cause our businesses to generate lower revenue, operating profits and cash flows.Our competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of the products that our businesses manufacture and the markets they serve. In general, most of our businesses compete with only a few companies. Our ability to compete effectively depends on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various competitive factors, including new products, digital solutions and support services that may be introduced by competitors, changes in customer preferences, evolving regulations, new business models and technologies and pricing pressures. If our businesses are unable to anticipate their competitors’ developments or identify customer needs and preferences on a timely basis, or successfully introduce new products, digital solutions and support services in response to such competitive factors, they could lose customers to competitors. If our businesses do not compete effectively, we may experience lower revenue, operating profits and cash flows.•Our operating results depend in part on the timely development and commercialization, and customer acceptance, of new and enhanced products, digital solutions and support services based on technological innovation.The success of new and improved products, digital solutions and support services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by our customers. Certain of our businesses sell in markets that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product introductions, changing industry standards and corresponding shifts in customer demand, which may result in unpredictable product transitions, shortened life cycles and increased importance of being first to market. Failure to correctly identify and predict customer needs and preferences, to deliver high quality, innovative and competitive products to the market, to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or to acquire rights to third-party technologies, to provide adequate data security and privacy protections and to stimulate customer demand for, and convince customers to adopt new products, digital solutions and support services could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, we may experience difficulties or delays in the research, development, production or marketing of new products, digital solutions and support services which may prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to continue to bring new products and services to market. •We could lose customers or generate lower revenue, operating profits and cash flows if there are significant increases in the cost of our raw materials or components or if suppliers are not able to meet our quality and delivery requirements.We purchase raw materials, sub-assemblies and components for use in our manufacturing operations. Factors such as freight costs, transportation availability, inventory levels, the level of imports, the imposition of duties, tariffs and other trade barriers and general economic conditions may affect the price of these raw materials, sub-assemblies and components. Significant price increases for certain commodities, other raw materials or components could adversely affect operating profits of our businesses. While we generally attempt to mitigate the impact of increased raw material prices by hedging or passing along the increased costs to customers, there may be a time delay between the increased raw material prices and the ability to increase the prices of products, or we may be unable to increase the prices of products due to a competitor’s pricing pressure or other factors. 18Table of ContentsWe use a wide range of raw materials and components in our manufacturing operations that come from numerous suppliers. While we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate, it is difficult to predict what effects of extended lead times or shortages may have in the future.  In addition, some of the raw materials and components may be available only from limited or single source suppliers. If a single source or limited source supplier were to cease or interrupt production for any reason or otherwise fail to supply those raw materials or components to us on favorable purchase terms, including at favorable prices, in sufficient quantities and with adequate lead times needed for efficient manufacturing, our ability to meet customer commitments, and satisfy market demands for affected products could be negatively affected. Consequently, a significant price increase in raw materials or a shortage in or the unavailability of raw materials or components may result in a loss of customers and adversely impact our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Legal and Regulatory Risks•Our businesses are subject to regulation and their profitability and reputation could be adversely affected by domestic and foreign governmental and public policy changes, risks associated with emerging markets, changes in statutory tax rates and unanticipated outcomes with respect to tax audits.Our businesses’ domestic and international sales and operations must comply with a wide variety of laws, regulations and policies (including environmental, employment and health and safety regulations, data security laws, data privacy laws, export/import laws, tax policies such as export subsidy programs and research and experimentation credits, carbon emission regulations, energy efficiency and design regulations and other similar programs). These laws, regulations and policies are complex, change frequently, have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions. Failure to comply (or any alleged or perceived failure to comply) with any of the foregoing could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties as well as potential damage to our reputation and disruption to our business. We cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with new and evolving regulatory reporting requirements and current or future laws will not exceed our estimates. In addition, the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union common market and the terms of the UK EU Trade and Cooperation agreement may impact our market access and pricing, compliance with regulatory requirements and ability to hire and maintain personnel. Any of these factors could adversely affect customer demand, our relationships with customers and suppliers, and our business and financial position. Certain of our businesses have sales or operations in countries, including Brazil, Russia, India and China, and may in the future invest in other countries, any of which may carry high levels of currency, political, compliance, or economic risk. While these risks or the impact of these risks are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could adversely affect our businesses and reputation. Our effective tax rate is impacted by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets and changes in tax laws. The amount of income taxes and other taxes paid can be adversely impacted by changes in statutory tax rates and laws and are subject to ongoing audits by domestic and international authorities. If these audits result in assessments different from amounts estimated, then our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows may be adversely affected by unfavorable tax adjustments.Financial and Strategic Risks •Our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on cross-border transactions and the translation of local currency results into U.S. dollars could negatively impact our results of operations.We conduct business through our subsidiaries in many different countries, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a significant impact on our reported consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, which are presented in U.S. dollars. Cross-border transactions, both with external parties and intercompany relationships, result in increased exposure to foreign exchange effects. Accordingly, significant changes in currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro, Chinese Renminbi (Yuan), Swedish krona, Pound Sterling, Indian rupee, Singapore dollar, Danish krone, and Canadian dollar, could cause fluctuations in the reported results of our businesses’ operations that could negatively affect our results of operations. Additionally, the strengthening of certain currencies such as the Euro and 19Table of ContentsU.S. dollar potentially exposes us to competitive threats from lower cost producers in other countries. Our sales are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign locations are translated into U.S. dollars.•Our growth and results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in our capital allocation and acquisition program.                    We expect to continue our strategy of seeking to acquire value creating add-on businesses that broaden our existing position and global reach as well as, in the right circumstances, strategically pursue larger acquisitions that could have the potential to either complement our existing businesses or allow us to pursue a new platform. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase, that we will be able to acquire such businesses on acceptable terms, or that all closing conditions will be satisfied with respect to any pending acquisition. In addition, we face the risk that a completed acquisition may underperform relative to expectations. We may not achieve the synergies originally anticipated, may become exposed to unexpected liabilities or may not be able to sufficiently integrate completed acquisitions into our current business and growth model. Further, if we fail to allocate our capital appropriately, in respect of either our acquisition program or organic growth in our operations, we could be overexposed in certain markets and geographies and unable to expand into adjacent products or markets. These factors could potentially have an adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.•If the Apergy spin-off, together with certain related transactions, does not qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we and our shareholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities.In connection with the spin-off of Apergy, we received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the ""IRS Ruling"") together with an opinion of McDermott Will & Emery LLP, our tax counsel, substantially to the effect that, among other things, certain transactions to effect the spin-off will qualify as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), and the distribution will qualify as a tax-free distribution to our shareholders under Section 355 of the Code. The IRS Ruling and the opinion of tax counsel relied on certain facts and assumptions, and certain representations and undertakings from us and Apergy, including those regarding the past and future conduct of certain of our businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied, we and our shareholders may not be able to rely on the IRS Ruling or the opinion, and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the IRS Ruling and the opinion, the IRS could determine on audit that the distribution is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion. In addition, we and Apergy intend for certain related transactions to qualify for tax-free treatment under U.S. federal, state and local tax law and/or foreign tax law.If the distribution is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we and our shareholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. For example, if the distribution fails to qualify for tax-free treatment, we would, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, be treated as if we had sold the Apergy common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value, and our shareholders who are subject to U.S. federal income tax would be treated as receiving a taxable distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of the Apergy common stock received in the distribution. In addition, if certain related transactions fail to qualify for tax-free treatment under U.S. federal, state and local tax law and/or foreign tax law, we could incur significant tax liabilities under U.S. federal, state, local and/or foreign tax law, respectively.•The indemnification provisions of acquisition and disposition agreements by which we have acquired or sold or disposed of companies may not fully protect us and may result in unexpected liabilities.Certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of those companies before we acquired them. In most of these agreements, however, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. Similarly, the purchasers of our disposed operations may from time to time agree to indemnify us for operations of such businesses after the closing. We cannot be assured that any of these indemnification provisions will fully protect us, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, we have retained certain liabilities directly or 20Table of Contentsthrough indemnifications made to the buyers of businesses we have sold or disposed against known and unknown contingent liabilities such as tax liabilities and environmental matters. In connection with the spin-off, Apergy agreed to indemnify us for any losses relating to the conduct of the Apergy business. There can be no assurance that the indemnity agreements will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of any liabilities that may arise, or that the indemnitors will be able to fully satisfy their indemnification obligations. The failure to receive amounts for which we are entitled to indemnification could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.Labor and Employment Risks•Our reputation, ability to do business and results of operations may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents, or business partners.While we strive to maintain high standards, we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by our employees, agents, or business partners that would violate United States and/or non-United States laws or fail to protect our confidential information, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, anti-kickback and false claims, competition, export and import compliance, environmental compliance, money laundering and data privacy, as well as the improper use of proprietary information or social media. Any such violations of law or improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the United States and in other jurisdictions, could lead to substantial civil or criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to increased costs of compliance and could damage our reputation, our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. •If we experience work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes, our productivity and results of operations could be adversely impacted.We have a number of collective bargaining units in the United States and various foreign collective labor arrangements. We are subject to potential work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes, any of which could adversely impact our productivity, reputation, consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  "
16,DOV,DOVER CORP,2020-02-14,"ITEM 1A.   RISK FACTORSThe risk factors discussed in this section should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this Form 10-K and should not be considered the only risks to which we are exposed. In general, we are subject to the same general risks and uncertainties that impact many other industrial companies such as general economic, industry and/or market conditions and growth rates; the impact of natural disasters and their effect on global markets; and changes in laws or accounting rules. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business, including our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. •Our results may be impacted by current domestic and international economic conditions and uncertainties.Our businesses may be adversely affected by disruptions in the financial markets or declines in economic activity both domestically and internationally in those countries in which we operate. These circumstances will also impact our suppliers and customers in various ways which could have an impact on our business operations, particularly if global credit markets are not operating efficiently and effectively to support industrial commerce.  Negative changes in worldwide economic and capital market conditions are beyond our control, are highly unpredictable and can have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and cost of capital.•We are subject to risks relating to our existing international operations and expansion into new geographical markets.Approximately 47% and 48% of our revenues for 2019 and 2018, respectively, were derived outside the United States. We continue to focus on global markets as part of our overall growth strategy and expect sales from outside the United States to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues. Our international operations and our global expansion strategy are subject to general risks related to such operations, including:o  political, social and economic instability and disruptions;o  government export controls, economic sanctions, embargoes or trade restrictions;o  the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers;o  limitations on ownership and dividend of earnings;o  transportation delays and interruptions;o  labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments;o  health or similar issues, such as a pandemic or epidemic;o  increased compliance costs, including costs associated with disclosure requirements and related due diligence;o  the impact of loss of a single-source manufacturing facility;o  difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations;o  limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies; ando  access to or control of networks and confidential information due to local government controls and vulnerability of local networks to cyber risks.If we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding our global business or adequately manage operational risks of our existing international operations, the risks could have a material adverse effect on our growth in geographic markets, our reputation, our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.16Table of Contents•Our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on cross-border transactions and the translation of local currency results into U.S. dollars could negatively impact our results of operations.We conduct business through our subsidiaries in many different countries, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a significant impact on our reported consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, which are presented in U.S. dollars. Cross-border transactions, both with external parties and intercompany relationships, result in increased exposure to foreign exchange effects. Accordingly, significant changes in currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro, Chinese Renminbi (Yuan), Swedish krona, Pound Sterling, Indian rupee, Singapore dollar, Danish krone, and Canadian dollar, could cause fluctuations in the reported results of our businesses’ operations that could negatively affect our results of operations. Additionally, the strengthening of certain currencies such as the Euro and U.S. dollar potentially exposes us to competitive threats from lower cost producers in other countries. Our sales are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign locations are translated into U.S. dollars.•Increasing product/service and price competition by international and domestic competitors, including new entrants, and our inability to introduce new and competitive products could cause our businesses to generate lower revenue, operating profits and cash flows.Our competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of the products that our businesses manufacture and the markets they serve.

If our businesses are unable to anticipate their competitors’ developments or identify customer needs and preferences on a timely basis, or successfully introduce new products, digital solutions and support services in response to such competitive factors, they could lose customers to competitors. If our businesses do not compete effectively, we may experience lower revenue, operating profits and cash flows.•Our operating results depend in part on the timely development and commercialization, and customer acceptance, of new and enhanced products, digital solutions and support services based on technological innovation.The success of new and improved products, digital solutions and support services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by our customers. Certain of our businesses sell in markets that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product introductions, changing industry standards and corresponding shifts in customer demand, which may result in unpredictable product transitions, shortened life cycles and increased importance of being first to market. Failure to correctly identify and predict customer needs and preferences, to deliver high quality, innovative and competitive products to the market, to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or to acquire rights to third-party technologies and to stimulate customer demand for, and convince customers to adopt new products, digital solutions and support services could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, we may experience difficulties or delays in the research, development, production or marketing of new products, digital solutions and support services which may prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to continue to bring new products and services to market. •Tariffs have resulted in increased prices and could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Over the last several years, tariffs under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 have been imposed on certain steel and aluminum products imported into the U.S. which have increased the prices of these inputs. Increased prices for imported steel and aluminum products have led domestic sellers to respond with market-based increases to prices for such inputs as well. Tariffs under Section 301 of the Trade Expansion Act were also imposed on goods imported from China in connection with China's intellectual property practices which may increase the cost to our customers of our products manufactured in China as well as the cost of Chinese sourced parts and components for our products manufactured in the U.S. China also has imposed tariffs on some U.S. goods that we manufacture and sell into China. 17Table of ContentsAn additional round of tariffs may be imposed on goods imported from China if ongoing trade negotiations between the U.S. and China are not successful. The existing tariffs, along with any additional tariffs or trade restrictions that may be implemented by the U.S. or other countries, could result in further increased prices and a decreased available supply of steel and aluminum as well as additional costs on imported components and inputs. We may not be able to pass price increases on to our customers and may not be able to secure adequate alternative sources on a timely basis. While retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. goods have not yet had a significant impact, we cannot predict further developments. The tariffs could adversely affect the operating profits for certain of our businesses and customer demand for certain of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.•Our businesses are subject to regulation and their profitability and reputation could be adversely affected by domestic and foreign governmental and public policy changes, risks associated with emerging markets, changes in statutory tax rates and unanticipated outcomes with respect to tax audits.Our businesses’ domestic and international sales and operations must comply with a wide variety of laws, regulations and policies (including environmental, employment and health and safety regulations, data security laws, data privacy laws, export/import laws, tax policies such as export subsidy programs and research and experimentation credits, carbon emission regulations and energy efficiency and design regulations and other similar programs). These laws, regulations and policies are complex, change frequently, have tended to become more stringent over time and may be inconsistent across jurisdictions. Failure to comply (or any alleged or perceived failure to comply) with any of the foregoing could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties as well as potential damage to our reputation and disruption to our business. We cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with new and evolving regulatory reporting requirements and current or future laws will not exceed our estimates. In addition, the Brexit withdrawal agreement and subsequent negotiations as to go-forward terms and conditions between the United Kingdom and the European Union may continue to cause political and economic uncertainty, including significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations. Although it is unknown what the full terms of the United Kingdom’s future relationship with the European Union will be following the transition period in 2020, it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the United Kingdom and other countries and increased regulatory complexities. Any of these factors could adversely affect customer demand, our relationships with customers and suppliers, and our business and financial position. Certain of our businesses have sales or operations in countries, including Brazil, Russia, India and China, and may in the future invest in other countries, any of which may carry high levels of currency, political, compliance, or economic risk. While these risks or the impact of these risks are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could adversely affect our businesses and reputation. Our effective tax rate is impacted by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets and changes in tax laws. The amount of income taxes and other taxes paid can be adversely impacted by changes in statutory tax rates and laws and are subject to ongoing audits by domestic and international authorities. If these audits result in assessments different from amounts estimated, then our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows may be adversely affected by unfavorable tax adjustments. •We could lose customers or generate lower revenue, operating profits and cash flows if there are significant increases in the cost of our raw materials or components or if suppliers are not able to meet our quality and delivery requirements.We purchase raw materials, sub-assemblies and components for use in our manufacturing operations, which exposes us to pricing and supply risks. Significant price increases for certain commodities, other raw materials or components could adversely affect operating profits of our businesses. While we generally attempt to mitigate the impact of increased raw material prices by hedging or passing along the increased costs to customers, there may be a time delay between the increased raw material prices and the ability to increase the prices of products, or we may be unable to increase the prices of products due to a competitor’s pricing pressure or other factors. We use a wide range of raw materials and components in our manufacturing operations that come from numerous suppliers around the world.  While we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally 18Table of Contentsadequate, it is difficult to predict what effects shortages may have in the future.  In addition, some of the raw materials and components may be available only from limited or single source suppliers. If a single source or limited source supplier were to cease or interrupt production for any reason or otherwise fail to supply those raw materials or components to us on favorable purchase terms, including at favorable prices, in sufficient quantities and with adequate lead times needed for efficient manufacturing, our ability to meet customer commitments, and satisfy market demands for affected products could be negatively affected. Consequently, a significant price increase in raw materials or a shortage in or the unavailability of raw materials or components may result in a loss of customers and adversely impact our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.•Our growth and results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in our capital allocation and acquisition program.We expect to continue our strategy of seeking to acquire value creating add-on businesses that broaden our existing position and global reach as well as, in the right circumstances, strategically pursue larger acquisitions that could have the potential to either complement our existing businesses or allow us to pursue a new platform. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase, that we will be able to acquire such businesses on acceptable terms, or that all closing conditions will be satisfied with respect to any pending acquisition. In addition, we face the risk that a completed acquisition may underperform relative to expectations. We may not achieve the synergies originally anticipated, may become exposed to unexpected liabilities or may not be able to sufficiently integrate completed acquisitions into our current business and growth model. Further, if we fail to allocate our capital appropriately, in respect of either our acquisition program or organic growth in our operations, we could be overexposed in certain markets and geographies and unable to expand into adjacent products or markets. These factors could potentially have an adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.•Our operating profits and cash flows could be adversely affected if we cannot achieve projected savings and synergies.We are continually evaluating our cost structure and seeking ways to capture synergies across our operations. For example, we recorded rightsizing costs in 2018, comprised of restructuring expense of $58.5 million and other costs of $14.3 million, and rightsizing costs in 2019, comprised of restructuring expense of $26.8 million and other costs of $5.3 million, primarily related to actions taken on employee reductions, facility consolidations and site closures, product line exits and other associated asset charges. These rightsizing activities and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities (including in connection with the integration of acquired businesses) may reduce our available talent, assets and other resources and could slow improvements in our products and services, adversely affect our ability to respond to customers and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases. In addition, delays in implementing planned restructuring activities or other productivity improvements, and unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational or financial benefits we expect to realize through our various programs. Any of the circumstances described above could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.•Our operations, businesses and products are subject to cybersecurity risks.  We depend on our own and third party IT systems, including cloud-based systems and managed service providers, to store, process and protect our information and support our business activities. We also use our third party IT systems to support employee data processing for our global work force and to support customer business activities, such as transmitting payment information, providing mobile monitoring services, and capturing operational data. Additionally, some of our products contain computer hardware and software and offer the ability to connect to computer networks. If these technologies, systems, products or services are damaged, cease to function properly, are compromised due to employee error, user error, malfeasance, system errors, or other vulnerabilities, or are subject to cybersecurity attacks, such as those involving denial of service attacks, unauthorized access, malicious software, or other intrusions, including by criminals, nation states or insiders, our business may be adversely impacted. The impacts could include production downtimes, operational delays, and other impacts on our operations and ability to provide products and services to our customers; compromise of confidential, proprietary or otherwise protected information, including personal information and customer confidential data; destruction, corruption, or theft of data; manipulation, disruption, or improper use of these technologies, systems, products or services; financial losses from fraudulent transactions, remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability; adverse media coverage; and legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations and actions; and damage to our reputation. There has been a rise in the number of cyberattacks targeting 19Table of Contentsconfidential business information generally and in the manufacturing industry specifically, as well as an increase in cyberattacks targeting managed service providers, by both state-sponsored and criminal organizations. Moreover, there has been a rise in the number of cyberattacks that depend on human error or manipulation, including phishing attacks or schemes that use social engineering to gain access to systems or perpetuate wire transfer or other frauds. These trends increase the likelihood of such events occurring as well as the costs associated with protecting against such attacks. It is possible for vulnerabilities in our IT systems to remain undetected for an extended period of time up to and including several years. While we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, systems monitoring and other technical security controls, a breach response plan, maintenance of backup and protective systems, and security personnel, our systems, networks, products and services remain potentially vulnerable to known or unknown cybersecurity attacks and other threats, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We, and the service providers that we depend on to support our systems and business operations, are regularly the target of attempted cyberattacks, including phishing and denial-of-service attacks, and must continuously monitor and develop our systems to protect our technology infrastructure and data from misappropriation or corruption.  In addition, a cybersecurity attack could persist for an extended period of time before being detected, and, following detection, it could take considerable time for us to obtain full and reliable information about the extent, amount and type of information compromised. During the course of an investigation, we may not know the full impact of the event and how to remediate it, and actions, decisions and mistakes that are taken or made may further increase the negative effects of the event on our business, results of operations and reputation. While we maintain insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of cybersecurity risks, such insurance coverage may not cover all losses or all types of claims that arise. As cyber threats continue to evolve, cybersecurity and data protection laws and regulations continue to develop in the U.S. and globally, and our business continues to move towards increased online connectivity within our information systems and through more Internet-enabled products and offerings, we expect to expend additional resources to continue to build out our compliance programs, strengthen our information security, data protection and business continuity measures, and investigate and remediate vulnerabilities.•Unforeseen developments in contingencies such as litigation and product recalls could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We and certain of our subsidiaries are, and from time to time may become, parties to a number of legal proceedings incidental to our businesses, including alleged injuries arising out of the use of products or exposure to hazardous substances, or claims related to patent infringement, employment matters and commercial disputes. The defense of these lawsuits may require significant expenses and divert management’s attention, and we may be required to pay damages that could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures. We may be exposed to product recalls and adverse public relations if our products are alleged to have defects, to cause property damage, to cause injury or illness, or if we are alleged to have violated governmental regulations. A product recall could result in substantial and unexpected expenditures, which would reduce operating profit and cash flow. In addition, a product recall may require significant management attention. Product recalls may hurt the value of our brands and lead to decreased demand for our products. Product recalls also may lead to increased scrutiny by federal, state or international regulatory agencies of our operations and increased litigation and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.•If the Apergy spin-off, together with certain related transactions, does not qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we and our shareholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities.In connection with the spin-off of Apergy, we received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the ""IRS Ruling"") together with an opinion of McDermott Will & Emery LLP, our tax counsel, substantially to the effect that, among other things, certain transactions to effect the spin-off will qualify as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), and the distribution will qualify as a tax-free distribution to our shareholders under Section 355 of the Code. The IRS Ruling and the opinion of tax counsel relied on certain facts and assumptions, and certain representations and undertakings from us and Apergy, 20Table of Contentsincluding those regarding the past and future conduct of certain of our businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied, we and our shareholders may not be able to rely on the IRS Ruling or the opinion, and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the IRS Ruling and the opinion, the IRS could determine on audit that the distribution is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion. In addition, we and Apergy intend for certain related transactions to qualify for tax-free treatment under U.S. federal, state and local tax law and/or foreign tax law.If the distribution is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we and our shareholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. For example, if the distribution fails to qualify for tax-free treatment, we would, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, be treated as if we had sold the Apergy common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value, and our shareholders who are subject to U.S. federal income tax would be treated as receiving a taxable distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of the Apergy common stock received in the distribution. In addition, if certain related transactions fail to qualify for tax-free treatment under U.S. federal, state and local tax law and/or foreign tax law, we could incur significant tax liabilities under U.S. federal, state, local and/or foreign tax law, respectively.•The indemnification provisions of acquisition and disposition agreements by which we have acquired or sold or disposed of companies may not fully protect us and may result in unexpected liabilities.Certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of those companies before we acquired them. In most of these agreements, however, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. Similarly, the purchasers of our disposed operations may from time to time agree to indemnify us for operations of such businesses after the closing. We cannot be assured that any of these indemnification provisions will fully protect us, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, we have retained certain liabilities directly or through indemnifications made to the buyers of businesses we have sold or disposed against known and unknown contingent liabilities such as tax liabilities and environmental matters. In connection with the spin-off, Apergy agreed to indemnify us for any losses relating to the conduct of the Apergy business. There can be no assurance that the indemnity agreements will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of any liabilities that may arise, or that the indemnitors will be able to fully satisfy their indemnification obligations. The failure to receive amounts for which we are entitled to indemnification could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.•Our reputation, ability to do business and results of operations may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents, or business partners.While we strive to maintain high standards, we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by our employees, agents, or business partners that would violate United States and/or non-United States laws or fail to protect our confidential information, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, anti-kickback and false claims, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy, as well as the improper use of proprietary information or social media. Any such violations of law or improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the United States and in other jurisdictions, could lead to substantial civil or criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to increased costs of compliance and could damage our reputation, our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  •Our revenue, operating profits and cash flows could be adversely affected if our businesses are unable to protect or obtain patent and other intellectual property rights.21Table of ContentsOur businesses own patents, trademarks, licenses and other forms of intellectual property related to their products and continuously invest in research and development that may result in innovations and general intellectual property rights. Our businesses employ various measures to develop, maintain and protect their intellectual property rights. These measures may not be effective in capturing intellectual property rights, and they may not prevent their intellectual property from being challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected. Unauthorized use of our businesses' intellectual property rights could adversely impact the competitive position of our businesses and could have a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.•If we experience work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes, our productivity and results of operations could be adversely impacted.We have a number of collective bargaining units in the United States and various foreign collective labor arrangements. We are subject to potential work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes, any of which could adversely impact our productivity, reputation, consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  "
4,DOV,DOVER CORP,2019-02-15,"ITEM 1A.   RISK FACTORSThe risk factors discussed in this section should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this Form 10-K and should not be considered the only risks to which we are exposed. In general, we are subject to the same general risks and uncertainties that impact many other industrial companies such as general economic, industry and/or market conditions and growth rates; the impact of natural disasters and their effect on global markets; and changes in laws or accounting rules. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business, including our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. •Our results may be impacted by current domestic and international economic conditions and uncertainties.Our businesses may be adversely affected by disruptions in the financial markets or declines in economic activity both domestically and internationally in those countries in which we operate. These circumstances will also impact our suppliers and customers in various ways which could have an impact on our business operations, particularly if global credit markets are not operating efficiently and effectively to support industrial commerce.  Negative changes in worldwide economic and capital market conditions are beyond our control, are highly unpredictable and can have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and cost of capital.•We are subject to risks relating to our existing international operations and expansion into new geographical markets.Approximately 48% and 46% of our revenues for 2018 and 2017, respectively, were derived outside the United States. We continue to focus on global markets as part of our overall growth strategy and expect sales from outside the United States to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues. Our international operations and our global expansion strategy are subject to general risks related to such operations, including:o  political, social and economic instability and disruptions;o  government export controls, economic sanctions, embargoes or trade restrictions;o  the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers;o  limitations on ownership and dividend of earnings;o  transportation delays and interruptions;o  labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments;o  increased compliance costs, including costs associated with disclosure requirements and related due diligence;o  the impact of loss of a single-source manufacturing facility;o  difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations;o  limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies; ando  access to or control of networks and confidential information due to local government controls and vulnerability of local networks to cyber risks.If we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding our global business or adequately manage operational risks of our existing international operations, the risks could have a material adverse effect on our growth in geographic markets, our reputation, our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.•Our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on cross-border transactions and the translation of local currency results into U.S. dollars could negatively impact our results of operations.We conduct business through our subsidiaries in many different countries, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a significant impact on our reported consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, which are presented in U.S. dollars. Cross-border transactions, both with external parties and intercompany relationships, result in increased exposure to foreign exchange effects. Accordingly, significant changes in currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro, Chinese Renminbi (Yuan), Swedish krona, Pound Sterling, Indian rupee, 15Table of Contents Singapore dollar, Danish krone, and Canadian dollar, could cause fluctuations in the reported results of our businesses’ operations that could negatively affect our results of operations. Additionally, the strengthening of certain currencies such as the Euro and U.S. dollar potentially exposes us to competitive threats from lower cost producers in other countries. Our sales are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign locations are translated into U.S. dollars.•Increasing product/service and price competition by international and domestic competitors, including new entrants, and our inability to introduce new and competitive products could cause our businesses to generate lower revenue, operating profits and cash flows.Our competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of the products that our businesses manufacture and the markets they serve. In general, most of our businesses compete with only a few companies. Our ability to compete effectively depends on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various competitive factors, including new products, digital solutions and support services that may be introduced by competitors, changes in customer preferences, new business models and technologies and pricing pressures. If our businesses are unable to anticipate their competitors’ developments or identify customer needs and preferences on a timely basis, or successfully introduce new products, digital solutions and support services in response to such competitive factors, they could lose customers to competitors. If our businesses do not compete effectively, we may experience lower revenue, operating profits and cash flows.•Our operating results depend in part on the timely development and commercialization, and customer acceptance, of new and enhanced products, digital solutions and support services based on technological innovation.The success of new and improved products, digital solutions and support services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by our customers. Certain of our businesses sell in markets that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product introductions, changing industry standards and corresponding shifts in customer demand, which may result in unpredictable product transitions, shortened life cycles and increased importance of being first to market.  Failure to correctly identify and predict customer needs and preferences, to deliver high quality, innovative and competitive products to the market, to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or to acquire rights to third-party technologies and to stimulate customer demand for, and convince customers to adopt, new products, digital solutions and support services could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, we may experience difficulties or delays in the research, development, production or marketing of new products, digital solutions and support services which may prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to continue to bring new products and services to market. •New tariffs have resulted in increased prices and could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Recently, tariffs under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 were imposed on certain steel and aluminum products imported into the U.S. which have increased the prices of these inputs. Increased prices for imported steel and aluminum products have led domestic sellers to respond with market-based increases to prices for such inputs as well. Tariffs under Section 301 of the Trade Expansion Act were also imposed on goods imported from China in connection with China's intellectual property practices which may increase the cost to our customers of our products manufactured in China as well as the cost of Chinese sourced parts and components for our products manufactured in the U.S. Additional tariffs have been announced that may be imposed on goods imported from China in the future. The new tariffs, along with any additional tariffs or trade restrictions that may be implemented by the U.S. or other countries, could result in further increased prices and a decreased available supply of steel and aluminum as well as additional imported components and inputs. We may not be able to pass price increases on to our customers and may not be able to secure adequate alternative sources of steel and aluminum on a timely basis. While retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries on U.S. goods have not yet had a significant impact, we cannot predict further developments. The tariffs could adversely affect the operating profits for certain of our businesses and customer demand for certain of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.16Table of Contents•Our businesses and their profitability and reputation could be adversely affected by domestic and foreign governmental and public policy changes, risks associated with emerging markets, changes in statutory tax rates and unanticipated outcomes with respect to tax audits.Our businesses’ domestic and international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in laws, regulations and policies (including environmental, employment and health and safety regulations, data security laws, data privacy laws, export/import laws, tax policies such as export subsidy programs and research and experimentation credits, carbon emission regulations and energy efficiency and design regulations and other similar programs). Failure to comply with any of the foregoing could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties as well as potential damage to our reputation. We cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with new and evolving regulatory reporting requirements and current or future laws will not exceed our estimates. In addition, the Brexit referendum in the United Kingdom in 2016 has caused and may continue to cause political and economic uncertainty, including significant volatility in global stock markets and currency exchange rate fluctuations. Although it is unknown what the full terms of the United Kingdom’s future relationship with the European Union will be, it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the United Kingdom and other countries and increased regulatory complexities. Any of these factors could adversely affect customer demand, our relationships with customers and suppliers, and our business and financial position. We have invested in certain countries, including Brazil, Russia, India and China, and may in the future invest in other countries, any of which may carry high levels of currency, political, compliance, or economic risk. While these risks or the impact of these risks are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could adversely affect our businesses and reputation. Our effective tax rate is impacted by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets and changes in tax laws. The amount of income taxes and other taxes paid can be adversely impacted by changes in statutory tax rates and laws and are subject to ongoing audits by domestic and international authorities. If these audits result in assessments different from amounts estimated, then our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows may be adversely affected by unfavorable tax adjustments. •We could lose customers or generate lower revenue, operating profits and cash flows if there are significant increases in the cost of raw materials (including energy) or if we are unable to obtain raw materials.We purchase raw materials, sub-assemblies and components for use in our manufacturing operations, which expose us to volatility in prices for certain commodities. Significant price increases for these commodities could adversely affect operating profits for certain of our businesses. While we generally attempt to mitigate the impact of increased raw material prices by hedging or passing along the increased costs to customers, there may be a time delay between the increased raw material prices and the ability to increase the prices of products, or we may be unable to increase the prices of products due to a competitor’s pricing pressure or other factors. In addition, while raw materials are generally available now, the inability to obtain necessary raw materials could affect our ability to meet customer commitments and satisfy market demand for certain products. Consequently, a significant price increase in raw materials, or their unavailability, may result in a loss of customers and adversely impact our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.•Our growth and results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in our capital allocation and acquisition program.We expect to continue our strategy of seeking to acquire value creating add-on businesses that broaden our existing position and global reach as well as, in the right circumstances, strategically pursue larger acquisitions that could have the potential to either complement our existing businesses or allow us to pursue a new platform. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase, that we will be able to acquire such businesses on acceptable terms, or that all closing conditions will be satisfied with respect to any pending acquisition. In addition, we face the risk that a completed acquisition may underperform relative to expectations. We may not achieve the synergies originally anticipated, may become exposed to unexpected liabilities or may not be able to sufficiently integrate completed acquisitions into our current business and growth model. Further, if we fail to allocate our capital appropriately, in respect of either our acquisition program or organic growth in our operations, we could be overexposed in certain markets and geographies and unable to expand into adjacent products or markets. These factors could potentially have an adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.17Table of Contents•Our operating profits and cash flows could be adversely affected if we cannot achieve projected savings and synergies.We are continually evaluating our cost structure and seeking ways to capture synergies across our operations. For example, during 2018, we recorded rightsizing and other related costs of $72.8 million primarily related to actions taken on employee reductions, facility consolidations and site closures, product line exits and other associated asset charges. These rightsizing activities and our regular ongoing cost reduction activities (including in connection with the integration of acquired businesses) may reduce our available talent, assets and other resources and could slow improvements in our products and services, adversely affect our ability to respond to customers and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases. In addition, delays in implementing planned restructuring activities or other productivity improvements, and unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational or financial benefits we expect to realize through our various programs.

There has been a rise in the number of cyberattacks targeting confidential business information generally and in the manufacturing industry specifically, as well as an increase in cyberattacks targeting managed service providers, by both state-sponsored and criminal organizations. Moreover, there has been a rise in the number of cyberattacks that depend on human error or manipulation, including phishing attacks or schemes that use social engineering to gain access to systems or perpetuate wire transfer or other frauds.

While we maintain insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of cybersecurity risks, such insurance coverage may not cover all losses or all types of claims that arise. As cyber threats continue to evolve, cybersecurity and data protection laws and regulations continue to develop in the U.S. and globally, and our business continues to move towards increased online connectivity within our information systems and through more Internet-enabled products and offerings, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to strengthen our information security, data protection and business continuity measures, and investigate and remediate vulnerabilities.•Unforeseen developments in contingencies such as litigation and product recalls could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We and certain of our subsidiaries are, and from time to time may become, parties to a number of legal proceedings incidental to our businesses, including alleged injuries arising out of the use of products or exposure to hazardous substances, or claims related to patent infringement, employment matters and commercial disputes. The defense of these lawsuits may require significant expenses and divert management’s attention, and we may be required to pay18Table of Contents damages that could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures. We may be exposed to product recalls and adverse public relations if our products are alleged to have defects, to cause property damage, to cause injury or illness, or if we are alleged to have violated governmental regulations. For example, during the fourth quarter of 2016, we determined there was a quality issue with a product component part in the Fluids segment and voluntarily reported this issue to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (“CPSC”). During the first quarter of 2017, we announced a voluntary recall of the product in conjunction with the CPSC that has since been satisfactorily closed out in 2018. See Note 15 — Commitments and Contingent Liabilities in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. A product recall could result in substantial and unexpected expenditures, which would reduce operating profit and cash flow. In addition, a product recall may require significant management attention. Product recalls may hurt the value of our brands and lead to decreased demand for our products. Product recalls also may lead to increased scrutiny by federal, state or international regulatory agencies of our operations and increased litigation and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.•If the Apergy spin-off, together with certain related transactions, does not qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we and our shareholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities.In connection with the spin-off of Apergy, we received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the ""IRS Ruling"") together with an opinion of McDermott Will & Emery LLP, our tax counsel, substantially to the effect that, among other things, certain transactions to effect the spin-off will qualify as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), and the distribution will qualify as a tax-free distribution to our shareholders under Section 355 of the Code. The IRS Ruling and the opinion of tax counsel relied on certain facts and assumptions, and certain representations and undertakings from us and Apergy, including those regarding the past and future conduct of certain of our businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied, we and our shareholders may not be able to rely on the IRS Ruling or the opinion, and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the IRS Ruling and the opinion, the IRS could determine on audit that the distribution is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion. In addition, we and Apergy intend for certain related transactions to qualify for tax-free treatment under U.S. federal, state and local tax law and/or foreign tax law.If the distribution is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we and our shareholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. For example, if the distribution fails to qualify for tax-free treatment, we would, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, be treated as if we had sold the Apergy common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value, and our shareholders who are subject to U.S. federal income tax would be treated as receiving a taxable distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of the Apergy common stock received in the distribution. In addition, if certain related transactions fail to qualify for tax-free treatment under U.S. federal, state and local tax law and/or foreign tax law, we could incur significant tax liabilities under U.S. federal, state, local and/or foreign tax law, respectively.•The indemnification provisions of acquisition and disposition agreements by which we have acquired or sold or disposed of companies may not fully protect us and may result in unexpected liabilities.Certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of those companies before we acquired them. In most of these agreements, however, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. Similarly, the purchasers of our discontinued operations may from time to time agree to indemnify us for operations of such businesses after the closing. We cannot be assured that any of these indemnification provisions will fully protect us, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, we have retained certain liabilities directly or through indemnifications made to the buyers of businesses we have sold or disposed against known and unknown contingent liabilities such as tax liabilities and environmental matters. 19Table of ContentsIn connection with the spin-off, Apergy agreed to indemnify us for any losses relating to the conduct of the Apergy business. There can be no assurance that the indemnity agreements will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of any liabilities that may arise, or that the indemnitors will be able to fully satisfy their indemnification obligations. The failure to receive amounts for which we are entitled to indemnification could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.•Our reputation, ability to do business and results of operations may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents, or business partners.While we strive to maintain high standards, we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by our employees, agents, or business partners that would violate United States and/or non-United States laws or fail to protect our confidential information, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, anti-kickback and false claims, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy, as well as the improper use of proprietary information or social media. Any such violations of law or improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the United States and in other jurisdictions, could lead to substantial civil or criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to increased costs of compliance and could damage our reputation, our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  •Our revenue, operating profits and cash flows could be adversely affected if our businesses are unable to protect or obtain patent and other intellectual property rights.Our businesses own patents, trademarks, licenses and other forms of intellectual property related to their products and continuously invest in research and development that may result in innovations and general intellectual property rights. Our businesses employ various measures to develop, maintain and protect their intellectual property rights. These measures may not be effective in capturing intellectual property rights, and they may not prevent their intellectual property from being challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected. Unauthorized use of our businesses' intellectual property rights could adversely impact the competitive position of our businesses and could have a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.•If we experience work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes, our productivity and results of operations could be adversely impacted.We have a number of collective bargaining units in the United States and various foreign collective labor arrangements. We are subject to potential work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes, any of which could adversely impact our productivity, reputation, consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  "
1,DOV,DOVER CORP,2018-02-09,"ITEM 1A.   RISK FACTORSThe risk factors discussed in this section should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this Form 10-K and should not be considered the only risks to which we are exposed. In general, we are subject to the same general risks and uncertainties that impact many other industrial companies such as general economic, industry and/or market conditions and growth rates; the impact of natural disasters and their effect on global markets; possible future terrorist threats and their effect on the worldwide economy; and changes in laws or accounting rules. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business, including our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. •Our results may be impacted by current domestic and international economic conditions and uncertainties.Our businesses may be adversely affected by disruptions in the financial markets or declines in economic activity both domestically and internationally in those countries in which we operate. These circumstances will also impact our suppliers and customers in various ways which could have an impact on our business operations, particularly if global credit markets are not operating efficiently and effectively to support industrial commerce.  Our Energy segment is subject to risk due to the volatility of global energy prices and regulations that impact drilling and production, with overall demand for our products and services impacted by depletion rates, global economic conditions and related energy demands.Negative changes in worldwide economic and capital market conditions are beyond our control, are highly unpredictable and can have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and cost of capital.•We are subject to risks relating to our existing international operations and expansion into new geographical markets.Approximately 44% and 42% of our revenues for 2017 and 2016, respectively, were derived outside the United States. We continue to focus on penetrating global markets as part of our overall growth strategy and expect sales from outside the United States to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues. Our international operations and our global expansion strategy are subject to general risks related to such operations, including:o  political, social and economic instability and disruptions;  o  government export controls, economic sanctions, embargoes or trade restrictions, including compliance with U.S. government licenses such as the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control’s General License H, violation of which could result in penalties and denial of export privileges;  o  the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers;  o  limitations on ownership and dividend of earnings;  o  transportation delays and interruptions;  o  labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments;  o  increased compliance costs, including costs associated with disclosure requirements and related due diligence;  o  the impact of loss of a single-source manufacturing facility;  o  difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations;  o  limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies; and  o  access to or control of networks and confidential information due to local government controls and vulnerability of local networks to cyber risks.If we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding our global business or adequately manage operational risks of our existing international operations, the risks could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy involving expansion into new geographical markets, our reputation, our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.12Table of Contents•Trends in oil and natural gas prices may affect the drilling and production activity, profitability and financial stability of our customers and therefore the demand for, and profitability of, our energy products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The oil and gas industry is cyclical in nature and experiences periodic downturns of varying length and severity. Most recently, the oil and gas industry experienced a significant downturn in 2015 and 2016. Demand for our energy products and services is sensitive to the level of drilling and production activity of, and the corresponding capital spending by, oil and natural gas companies. The level of drilling and production activity is directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices. Oil and gas prices and the level of drilling and production activity have been characterized by significant volatility in recent years. In particular, the prices of oil and natural gas were highly volatile in 2014 and 2015 on significant over supply and declined dramatically.     Prices for oil and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty, geopolitical developments and a variety of other factors that are beyond our control. Prices of oil began to recover in late 2016 but there can be no assurance that increases will continue. We expect continued volatility in both crude oil and natural gas prices, as well as in the level of drilling and production related activities. Given the long-term nature of many large-scale development projects, another future significant downturn in the oil and gas industry could result in the reduction in demand for our energy and pumps products and services, and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. •The proposed spin-off of Wellsite may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline or terms, or at all, and may not achieve the intended benefits.We have previously announced in 2017 a plan to pursue a tax-free spin-off of our Wellsite business into a standalone, publicly-traded company. We expect to complete the spin-off in May of 2018, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain customary conditions. However, unanticipated developments, including delays in obtaining tax rulings, changes in the macroeconomic environment, uncertainty of the financial markets and challenges in establishing infrastructure or processes could delay or prevent the proposed spin-off or cause the proposed spin-off to occur on terms or conditions that are less favorable and/or different than expected. Even if the transaction is completed, we may not realize some or all of the anticipated benefits from the spin-off.  We also have incurred and will continue to incur significant expenses in connection with the proposed spin-off which may exceed our current expectations.  Executing the proposed spin-off requires significant time and attention from management, which could distract them from other tasks in operating our business. Additionally, our employees may be distracted due to uncertainty about their future roles pending the completion of the spin-off. Following the proposed spin-off, the combined value of the common stock of the two publicly-traded companies may not be equal to or greater than what the value of our common stock would have been had the proposed spin-off not occurred. In addition, investor sentiment could result in excess selling causing greater volatility in our share price following the consummation of the proposed spin-off. Finally, if we fail to complete the spin-off, we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets.  •If the Wellsite spin-off, together with certain related transactions, does not qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we and our shareholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities.A condition to the spin-off is the receipt by us of either (i) a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (the ""IRS Ruling"") together with an opinion of McDermott Will & Emery LLP, our tax counsel, substantially to the effect that, among other things, certain transactions to effect the spin-off will qualify as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”), and the distribution will qualify as a tax-free distribution to our shareholders under Section 355 of the Code, or (ii) an opinion of McDermott Will & Emery LLP, our tax counsel, substantially to the effect that, among other things, certain transactions to effect the spin-off will qualify as a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Section 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code and the distribution of shares of Wellsite will qualify as a tax-free distribution to our shareholders under Section 355 of the Code. The IRS Ruling (if obtained) and the opinion of tax counsel will rely on certain facts and assumptions, and certain representations and undertakings from us and Wellsite, including those regarding the past and future conduct of certain of our businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied, we and our shareholders may not be able to rely on the IRS Ruling (if obtained) or the opinion, and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the IRS Ruling (if obtained) and the opinion, the IRS could determine on audit that the distribution is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions 13Table of Contentsin the opinion. In addition, we and Wellsite intend for certain related transactions to qualify for tax-free treatment under U.S. federal, state and local tax law and/or foreign tax law.If the distribution is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we and our shareholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. For example, if the distribution fails to qualify for tax-free treatment, we would, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, be treated as if we had sold the Wellsite common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value, and our shareholders who are subject to U.S. federal income tax would be treated as receiving a taxable distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of the Wellsite common stock received in the distribution. In addition, if certain related transactions fail to qualify for tax-free treatment under U.S. federal, state and local tax law and/or foreign tax law, we could incur significant tax liabilities under U.S. federal, state, local and/or foreign tax law, respectively.•Our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on cross-border transactions and the translation of local currency results into U.S. dollars could negatively impact our results of operations.We conduct business through our subsidiaries in many different countries, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a significant impact on our reported consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, which are presented in U.S. dollars. Cross-border transactions, both with external parties and intercompany relationships, result in increased exposure to foreign exchange effects. Accordingly, significant changes in currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro, Pound Sterling, Swiss franc, Chinese Renminbi (Yuan), Brazilian real and the Canadian dollar, could cause fluctuations in the reported results of our businesses’ operations that could negatively affect our results of operations. Additionally, the strengthening of certain currencies such as the Euro and U.S. dollar potentially exposes us to competitive threats from lower cost producers in other countries. Our sales are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign locations are translated into U.S. dollars.•Increasing product/service and price competition by international and domestic competitors, including new entrants, and our inability to introduce new and competitive products could cause our businesses to generate lower revenue, operating profits and cash flows.Our competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of the products that our businesses manufacture and the markets they serve. In general, most of our businesses compete with only a few companies. Our ability to compete effectively depends on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various competitive factors, including new products and services that may be introduced by competitors, changes in customer preferences, new business models and technologies and pricing pressures. If our businesses are unable to anticipate their competitors’ development of new products and services and/or identify customer needs and preferences on a timely basis, or successfully introduce new products and services in response to such competitive factors, they could lose customers to competitors. If our businesses do not compete effectively, we may experience lower revenue, operating profits and cash flows.•Our operating results depend in part on the timely development and commercialization, and customer acceptance, of new and enhanced products and services based on technological innovation.The success of new and improved products and services depends on their initial and continued acceptance by our customers. Certain of our businesses sell their products and services in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes, frequent new product introductions, changing industry standards and corresponding shifts in customer demand, which may result in unpredictable product transitions, shortened life cycles and increased importance of being first to market with new products and services.  Failure to correctly identify and predict customer needs and preferences, to deliver high quality, innovative and competitive products to the market, to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or to acquire rights to third-party technologies and to stimulate customer demand for, and convince customers to adopt, new products and services could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, we may experience difficulties or delays in the research, development, production and/or marketing of new products and services which may prevent us from recouping or realizing a return on the investments required to continue to bring new products and services to market. 14Table of Contents•Our businesses and their profitability and reputation could be adversely affected by domestic and foreign governmental and public policy changes, risks associated with emerging markets, changes in statutory tax rates and unanticipated outcomes with respect to tax audits.Our businesses’ domestic and international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in laws, regulations and policies (including environmental and employment regulations, data security laws, data privacy laws, export/import laws, tax policies such as export subsidy programs and research and experimentation credits, carbon emission regulations and other similar programs). Failure to comply with any of the foregoing could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties as well as potential damage to our reputation. We cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with new and evolving regulatory reporting requirements and current or future laws, including environmental protection, employment, data security, data privacy and health and safety laws, will not exceed our estimates. In addition, we have invested in certain countries, including Brazil, Russia, India and China, and may in the future invest in other countries, any of which may carry high levels of currency, political, compliance, or economic risk. While these risks or the impact of these risks are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could adversely affect our businesses and reputation. Our effective tax rate is impacted by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets and changes in tax laws. The amount of income taxes and other taxes paid can be adversely impacted by changes in statutory tax rates and laws and are subject to ongoing audits by domestic and international authorities. If these audits result in assessments different from amounts estimated, then our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows may be adversely affected by unfavorable tax adjustments. •We could lose customers or generate lower revenue, operating profits and cash flows if there are significant increases in the cost of raw materials (including energy) or if we are unable to obtain raw materials.We purchase raw materials, sub-assemblies and components for use in our manufacturing operations, which expose us to volatility in prices for certain commodities. Significant price increases for these commodities could adversely affect operating profits for certain of our businesses. While we generally attempt to mitigate the impact of increased raw material prices by hedging or passing along the increased costs to customers, there may be a time delay between the increased raw material prices and the ability to increase the prices of products, or we may be unable to increase the prices of products due to a competitor’s pricing pressure or other factors. In addition, while raw materials are generally available now, the inability to obtain necessary raw materials could affect our ability to meet customer commitments and satisfy market demand for certain products. Consequently, a significant price increase in raw materials, or their unavailability, may result in a loss of customers and adversely impact our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.•Our growth and results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in our capital allocation and acquisition program.We expect to continue our strategy of seeking to acquire value creating add-on businesses that broaden our existing position and global reach as well as, in the right circumstances, strategically pursue larger acquisitions that could have the potential to either complement our existing businesses or allow us to pursue a new platform. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase, that we will be able to acquire such businesses on acceptable terms, or that all closing conditions will be satisfied with respect to any pending acquisition. If we are unsuccessful in our acquisition efforts, then our ability to continue to grow at rates similar to prior years could be adversely affected. In addition, we face the risk that a completed acquisition may underperform relative to expectations. We may not achieve the synergies originally anticipated, may become exposed to unexpected liabilities or may not be able to sufficiently integrate completed acquisitions into our current business and growth model. Further, if we fail to allocate our capital appropriately, in respect of either our acquisition program or organic growth in our operations, we could be overexposed in certain markets and geographies and unable to expand into adjacent products or markets. These factors could potentially have an adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.•Our operating profits and cash flows could be adversely affected if we cannot achieve projected savings and synergies.We are continually evaluating our cost structure and seeking ways to capture synergies across our operations. For example, during the fourth quarter of 2017, we recorded rightsizing and other related costs of $56.3 million to better align our cost structure in preparation for the Wellsite separation. These rightsizing activities and our regular ongoing cost reduction 15Table of Contentsactivities  (including in connection with the integration of acquired businesses) may reduce our available talent, assets and other resources and could slow improvements in our products and services, adversely affect our ability to respond to customers and limit our ability to increase production quickly if demand for our products increases. In addition, delays in implementing planned restructuring activities or other productivity improvements, unexpected costs or failure to meet targeted improvements may diminish the operational or financial benefits we expect to realize through our various programs. Any of the circumstances described above could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.•Our operations, businesses and products are subject to cybersecurity risks.  We depend on our own and third party information technology (“IT”) systems, including cloud-based systems, to store and process information and support our business activities. We also use our third party IT systems to support customer business activities, such as transmitting payment information, providing mobile monitoring services, and capturing operational data. Additionally, some of our products contain computer hardware and software and offer the ability to connect to computer networks. If these technologies, systems, products or services are damaged, cease to function properly, are compromised due to employee error, user error, malfeasance, system errors, or other vulnerabilities, or are subject to cybersecurity attacks, such as those involving unauthorized access, malicious software, or other intrusions, including by criminals, nation states or insiders, our business may be adversely impacted. The impacts could include production downtimes, operational delays, and other impacts on our operations and ability to provide products and services to our customers; compromise of confidential, proprietary or otherwise protected information, including personal and customer data; destruction, corruption, or theft of data; manipulation, disruption, or improper use of these technologies, systems, products or services; financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability; adverse media coverage;  and legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations and actions; and damage to our reputation. While we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, technical security controls, a breach response plan, maintenance of backup and protective systems, and security personnel, our systems, networks, products and services remain potentially vulnerable to known or unknown cybersecurity attacks and other threats, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. While we maintain insurance coverage that is intended to address certain aspects of cybersecurity risks, such insurance coverage may not cover all losses or all types of claims that arise.•Unforeseen developments in contingencies such as litigation and product recalls could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We and certain of our subsidiaries are, and from time to time may become, parties to a number of legal proceedings incidental to our businesses, including alleged injuries arising out of the use of products or exposure to hazardous substances, or claims related to patent infringement, employment matters and commercial disputes. The defense of these lawsuits may require significant expenses and divert management’s attention, and we may be required to pay damages that could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures. We may be exposed to product recalls and adverse public relations if our products are alleged to have defects, to cause property damage, to cause injury or illness, or if we are alleged to have violated governmental regulations. For example, during the fourth quarter of 2016, we determined there was a quality issue with a product component part in the Fluids segment and voluntarily reported this issue to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (“CPSC”). During the first quarter of 2017, we announced a voluntary recall of the product in conjunction with the CPSC. See Note 14 — Commitments and Contingent Liabilities in the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. A product recall could result in substantial and unexpected expenditures, which would reduce operating profit and cash flow. In addition, a product recall may require significant management attention. Product recalls may hurt the value of our brands and lead to decreased demand for our products. Product recalls also may lead to increased scrutiny by federal, state or international regulatory agencies of our operations and increased litigation and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.•The indemnification provisions of acquisition and disposition agreements by which we have acquired or sold companies may not fully protect us and may result in unexpected liabilities.Certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of those companies before we acquired them. In most of these agreements, however, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet 16Table of Contentstheir indemnification responsibilities. Similarly, the purchasers of our discontinued operations may from time to time agree to indemnify us for operations of such businesses after the closing. We cannot be assured that any of these indemnification provisions will fully protect us, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.   •Failure to attract, retain and develop personnel or to provide adequate succession plans for key management could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Our growth, profitability and effectiveness in conducting our operations and executing our strategic plans depend in part on our ability to attract, retain and develop qualified personnel, align them with appropriate opportunities and maintain adequate succession plans for key management positions and support for strategic initiatives. If we are unsuccessful in these efforts, our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected and we could miss opportunities for growth and efficiencies. •Our reputation, ability to do business and results of operations may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents, or business partners.While we strive to maintain high standards, we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by our employees, agents, or business partners that would violate United States and/or non-United States laws or fail to protect our confidential information, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, anti-kickback and false claims, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy, as well as the improper use of proprietary information or social media. Any such violations of law or improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the United States and in other jurisdictions, could lead to substantial civil or criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to increased costs of compliance and could damage our reputation, our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  •Our revenue, operating profits and cash flows could be adversely affected if our businesses are unable to protect or obtain patent and other intellectual property rights.Our businesses own patents, trademarks, licenses and other forms of intellectual property related to their products and continuously invest in research and development that may result in innovations and general intellectual property rights. Our businesses employ various measures to develop, maintain and protect their intellectual property rights. These measures may not be effective in capturing intellectual property rights, and they may not prevent their intellectual property from being challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected. Unauthorized use of our businesses' intellectual property rights could adversely impact the competitive position of our businesses and could have a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.•A significant decline in the future economic outlook of our businesses and expected future cash flows could result in goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges which would negatively impact our results of operations.  We have significant goodwill and intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet as a result of current and past acquisitions. The valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful lives involve significant judgments and the use of estimates. The testing of goodwill and intangibles for impairment requires significant use of judgment and assumptions, particularly as it relates to the determination of fair market value. A decrease in the long-term economic outlook and future cash flows of our businesses could significantly impact asset values and potentially result in the impairment of intangible assets, including goodwill. Charges relating to such impairments could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations in the periods recognized. •Our borrowing costs may be impacted by our credit ratings developed by various rating agencies.Three major ratings agencies (Moody’s, Standard and Poor’s and Fitch Ratings) evaluate our credit profile on an ongoing basis and have each assigned high ratings for our short-term and long-term debt as of December 31, 2017. Although we do not anticipate a material change in our credit ratings, if our current credit ratings deteriorate, then our borrowing costs could increase, including increased fees under our five-year credit facility, and our access to future sources of liquidity may be adversely affected.17Table of Contents•If we experience work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes, our productivity and results of operations could be adversely impacted.We have a number of collective bargaining units in the United States and various foreign collective labor arrangements. We are subject to potential work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes, any of which could adversely impact our productivity, reputation, consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  "
7,DOV,DOVER CORP,2017-02-10,"ITEM 1A.   RISK FACTORSThe risk factors discussed in this section should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this Form 10-K and should not be considered the only risks to which we are exposed. In general, we are subject to the same general risks and uncertainties that impact many other industrial companies such as general economic, industry and/or market conditions and growth rates; the impact of natural disasters and their effect on global markets; possible future terrorist threats and their effect on the worldwide economy; and changes in laws or accounting rules. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business, including our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. •Our results may be impacted by current domestic and international economic conditions and uncertainties.Our businesses may be adversely affected by disruptions in the financial markets or declines in economic activity both domestically and internationally in those countries in which we operate. These circumstances will also impact our suppliers and customers in various ways which could have an impact on our business operations, particularly if global credit markets are not operating efficiently and effectively to support industrial commerce.  Our Energy segment is subject to risk due to the volatility of global energy prices and regulations that impact drilling and production, with overall demand for our products and services impacted by depletion rates, global economic conditions and related energy demands.Negative changes in worldwide economic and capital market conditions are beyond our control, are highly unpredictable and can have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and cost of capital.•Trends in oil and natural gas prices may affect the drilling and production activity, profitability and financial stability of our customers and therefore the demand for, and profitability of, our energy products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. The oil and gas industry historically has experienced periodic downturns, including the significant downturn experienced in 2015 and 2016. Demand for our energy products and services is sensitive to the level of drilling and production activity of, and the corresponding capital spending by, oil and natural gas companies. The level of drilling and production activity is directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices, which have been recently volatile and may continue to be volatile. In particular, the prices of oil and natural gas were highly volatile in 2014 and 2015 and declined dramatically. Prices of oil began to recover in late 2016 but there can be no assurance that increases will continue.     Prices for oil and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty, geopolitical developments and a variety of other factors that are beyond our control. Even the perception of longer-term lower oil and natural gas prices can reduce or defer major capital expenditures by our customers in the oil and gas industry. Given the long-term nature of many large-scale development projects, a significant downturn in the oil and gas industry could result in the reduction in demand for our energy and pumps products and services, and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. 12Table of Contents•We are subject to risks relating to our existing international operations and expansion into new geographical markets.Approximately 42% of our revenues from continuing operations for 2016 and 39% of our revenues for 2015 were derived outside the United States. We continue to focus on penetrating global markets as part of our overall growth strategy and expect sales from outside the United States to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues. Our international operations and our global expansion strategy are subject to general risks related to such operations, including:o  political, social and economic instability and disruptions;  o  government export controls, economic sanctions, embargoes or trade restrictions, including compliance with U.S. government licenses such as the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control’s General License H, violation of which could result in penalties and denial of export privileges;  o  the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers;  o  limitations on ownership and on repatriation or dividend of earnings;  o  transportation delays and interruptions;  o  labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments;  o  increased compliance costs, including costs associated with disclosure requirements and related due diligence;  o  the impact of loss of a single-source manufacturing facility;  o  difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations;  o  limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies; and  o  access to or control of networks and confidential information due to local government controls and vulnerability of local networks to cyber risks.If we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding our global business or adequately manage operational risks of our existing international operations, the risks could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy involving expansion into new geographical markets, our reputation, our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.•Our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on cross-border transactions and the translation of local currency results into U.S. dollars could negatively impact our results of operations.We conduct business through our subsidiaries in many different countries, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a significant impact on our reported consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, which are presented in U.S. dollars. For example, foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. Cross-border transactions, both with external parties and intercompany relationships, result in increased exposure to foreign exchange effects. Accordingly, significant changes in currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro, Pound Sterling, Swiss franc, Chinese Renminbi (Yuan), Brazilian real and the Canadian dollar, could cause fluctuations in the reported results of our businesses’ operations that could negatively affect our results of operations. Additionally, the strengthening of certain currencies such as the Euro and U.S. dollar potentially exposes us to competitive threats from lower cost producers in other countries. Our sales are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign locations are translated into U.S. dollars.•Increasing product/service and price competition by international and domestic competitors, including new entrants, and our inability to introduce new and competitive products could cause our businesses to generate lower revenue, operating profits and cash flows.Our competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of the products that our businesses manufacture and the markets they serve. In general, most of our businesses compete with only a few companies. Our ability to compete effectively depends on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various competitive factors, including new products and services that may be introduced by competitors, changes in customer preferences, new business models and technologies and pricing pressures. If our businesses are unable to anticipate their competitors’ development of new products and services and/or identify customer needs and preferences on a timely basis, or successfully introduce new products and services in response to such competitive factors, they could lose customers to competitors. If our businesses do not compete effectively, we may experience lower revenue, operating profits and cash flows.13Table of Contents•Some of our businesses may not anticipate, adapt to, or capitalize on technological developments and this could cause these businesses to become less competitive and lead to reduced market share, revenue, operating profits and cash flows.Certain of our businesses sell their products in industries that are constantly experiencing change as new technologies are developed. In order to grow and remain competitive in these industries, they must adapt to future changes in technology to enhance their existing products and introduce new products to address their customers’ changing demands. If these businesses are unable to adapt to the rapid technological changes, it could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows.•Our businesses and their profitability and reputation could be adversely affected by domestic and foreign governmental and public policy changes, risks associated with emerging markets, changes in statutory tax rates and unanticipated outcomes with respect to tax audits.Our businesses’ domestic and international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in laws, regulations and policies (including environmental and employment regulations, export/import laws, tax policies such as export subsidy programs and research and experimentation credits, carbon emission regulations and other similar programs). Failure to comply with any of the foregoing could result in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties as well as potential damage to our reputation. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with new and evolving regulatory reporting requirements and current or future laws, including environmental protection, employment, data security, data privacy and health and safety laws, will not exceed our estimates. In addition, we have invested in certain countries, including Brazil, Russia, India and China, and may in the future invest in other countries, any of which may carry high levels of currency, political, compliance, or economic risk. While these risks or the impact of these risks are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could adversely affect our businesses and reputation. Our effective tax rate is impacted by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets and changes in tax laws. The amount of income taxes and other taxes paid can be adversely impacted by changes in statutory tax rates and laws and are subject to ongoing audits by domestic and international authorities. If these audits result in assessments different from amounts estimated, then our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows may be adversely affected by unfavorable tax adjustments. •We could lose customers or generate lower revenue, operating profits and cash flows if there are significant increases in the cost of raw materials (including energy) or if we are unable to obtain raw materials.We purchase raw materials, sub-assemblies and components for use in our manufacturing operations, which expose us to volatility in prices for certain commodities. Significant price increases for these commodities could adversely affect operating profits for certain of our businesses. While we generally attempt to mitigate the impact of increased raw material prices by hedging or passing along the increased costs to customers, there may be a time delay between the increased raw material prices and the ability to increase the prices of products, or we may be unable to increase the prices of products due to a competitor’s pricing pressure or other factors. In addition, while raw materials are generally available now, the inability to obtain necessary raw materials could affect our ability to meet customer commitments and satisfy market demand for certain products. Consequently, a significant price increase in raw materials, or their unavailability, may result in a loss of customers and adversely impact our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.•Our growth and results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in our capital allocation and acquisition program.We expect to continue our strategy of seeking to acquire value creating add-on businesses that broaden our existing position and global reach as well as, in the right circumstances, strategically pursue larger acquisitions that could have the potential to either complement our existing businesses or allow us to pursue a new platform. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase, that we will be able to acquire such businesses on acceptable terms, or that all closing conditions will be satisfied with respect to any pending acquisition. If we are unsuccessful in our acquisition efforts, then our ability to continue to grow at rates similar to prior years could be adversely affected.  In addition, we face the risk that a completed acquisition may underperform relative to expectations.  We may not achieve the synergies originally anticipated, may become exposed to unexpected liabilities or may not be able to sufficiently integrate completed acquisitions into our current business and growth model. Further, if we fail to allocate our capital appropriately, in respect of either our acquisition program or organic growth in our operations, we could be overexposed in certain markets and geographies and unable to expand into adjacent products or markets. These factors could potentially have an adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.14Table of Contents•Our operating profits and cash flows could be adversely affected if we cannot achieve projected savings and synergies.We are continually evaluating our cost structure and seeking ways to capture synergies across our operations. If we are unable to reduce costs and expenses through our various programs, it could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.•Unforeseen developments in contingencies such as litigation and product recalls could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.We and certain of our subsidiaries are, and from time to time may become, parties to a number of legal proceedings incidental to their businesses involving alleged injuries arising out of the use of their products, exposure to hazardous substances, or patent infringement, employment matters and commercial disputes. The defense of these lawsuits may require significant expenses and divert management’s attention, and we may be required to pay damages that could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures. We may be exposed to product recalls and adverse public relations if our products are alleged to have defects, to cause property damage, to cause injury or illness, or if we are alleged to have violated governmental regulations. For example, during the fourth quarter of 2016, we determined there was a quality issue with a product component part in the Fluids segment and voluntarily reported this issue to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (“CPSC”). We are finalizing a plan to announce a voluntary recall of the product in conjunction with the CPSC. A product recall could result in substantial and unexpected expenditures, which would reduce operating profit and cash flow. In addition, a product recall may require significant management attention. Product recalls may hurt the value of our brands and lead to decreased demand for our products. Product recalls also may lead to increased scrutiny by federal, state or international regulatory agencies of our operations and increased litigation and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.•The indemnification provisions of acquisition and disposition agreements by which we have acquired or sold companies may not fully protect us and may result in unexpected liabilities.Certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of those companies before we acquired them. In most of these agreements, however, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. Similarly, the purchasers of our discontinued operations may from time to time agree to indemnify us for operations of such businesses after the closing. In addition, in connection with the spin-off, Knowles agreed to indemnify us for any losses relating to the conduct of the Knowles business. We cannot be assured that any of these indemnification provisions will fully protect us, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.   •Failure to attract, retain and develop personnel or to provide adequate succession plans for key management could have an adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Our growth, profitability and effectiveness in conducting our operations and executing our strategic plans depend in part on our ability to attract, retain and develop qualified personnel, align them with appropriate opportunities and maintain adequate succession plans for key management positions and support for strategic initiatives. If we are unsuccessful in these efforts, our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected and we could miss opportunities for growth and efficiencies. •Our operations and businesses are subject to cybersecurity and privacy risks.  We depend on various information technologies throughout our company to store and process information and support our business activities. We also manufacture and sell hardware and software products, and in some cases, we also provide services that support customer business activities, such as transmitting payment information, providing mobile monitoring services and capturing operational data. If these technologies, systems, products or services are damaged, cease to function properly, are breached due to employee error, malfeasance, system errors, or other vulnerabilities, or are subject to cybersecurity attacks, such as those involving unauthorized access, malicious software and/or other intrusions, including by criminals, nation states or insiders, we could experience production downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the compromising of confidential, proprietary or otherwise protected information, including personal and customer data, destruction, corruption, or theft of data, security 15Table of Contentsbreaches, other manipulation, disruption, misappropriation or improper use of our systems or networks, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, adverse media coverage, legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations and actions, and/or damage to our reputation. While we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, technical security controls and maintenance of backup and protective systems, our systems, networks, products and services remain potentially vulnerable to known or unknown cybersecurity attacks and other threats, any of which could have a material adverse affect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  •Our reputation, ability to do business and results of operations may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents, or business partners.While we strive to maintain high standards, we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by our employees, agents, or business partners that would violate United States and/or non-United States laws or fail to protect our confidential information, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, anti-kickback and false claims, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy, as well as the improper use of proprietary information or social media. Any such violations of law or improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the United States and in other jurisdictions, could lead to substantial civil or criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to increased costs of compliance and could damage our reputation, our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.  •Our revenue, operating profits and cash flows could be adversely affected if our businesses are unable to protect or obtain patent and other intellectual property rights.Our businesses own patents, trademarks, licenses and other forms of intellectual property related to their products and continuously invest in research and development that may result in innovations and general intellectual property rights. Our businesses employ various measures to develop, maintain and protect their intellectual property rights. These measures may not be effective in capturing intellectual property rights, and they may not prevent their intellectual property from being challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected. Unauthorized use of our businesses' intellectual property rights could adversely impact the competitive position of our businesses and have a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.•A significant decline in the future economic outlook of our businesses and expected future cash flows could result in goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges which would negatively impact our results of operations.  We have significant goodwill and intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet as a result of current and past acquisitions. The valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful lives involve significant judgments and the use of estimates. The testing of goodwill and intangibles for impairment requires significant use of judgment and assumptions, particularly as it relates to the determination of fair market value. A decrease in the long-term economic outlook and future cash flows of our businesses could significantly impact asset values and potentially result in the impairment of intangible assets, including goodwill. Charges relating to such impairments could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations in the periods recognized. Although fair values currently exceed carrying values in all of our businesses, the value of our businesses within the Energy segment were unfavorably impacted by the steep declines in revenue and order rates during the year as drilling and production activity fell due to unfavorable oil prices and lower U.S. rig counts.•Our borrowing costs may be impacted by our credit ratings developed by various rating agencies.Three major ratings agencies (Moody’s, Standard and Poor’s and Fitch Ratings) evaluate our credit profile on an ongoing basis and have each assigned high ratings for our short-term and long-term debt as of December 31, 2016.  Although we do not anticipate a material change in our credit ratings, if our current credit ratings deteriorate, then our borrowing costs could increase, including increased fees under our five-year credit facility, and our access to future sources of liquidity may be adversely affected.•If we experience work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes, our productivity and results of operations could be adversely impacted.We have a number of collective bargaining units in the United States and various foreign collective labor arrangements. We are subject to potential work stoppages, union and works council campaigns and other labor disputes, any of which could adversely impact our productivity, reputation, consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.16Table of Contents•Customer requirements and new regulations may increase our expenses and impact the availability of certain raw materials, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating profits.Our businesses use parts or materials that are impacted by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the ""Dodd-Frank Act"") requirement for disclosure of the use of ""conflict minerals"" mined in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries. It is possible that some of our businesses' customers will require ""conflict free"" metals in products purchased from us. We are in the process of determining the country of origin of certain metals used by our businesses, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The supply chain due diligence and verification of sources may require several years to complete based on the current availability of smelter origin information and the number of vendors. We may not be able to complete the process in the time frame required because of the complexity of our supply chain.  Other governmental social responsibility regulations also may impact our suppliers, manufacturing operations and operating profits. The need to find alternative sources for certain raw materials or products because of customer requirements and regulations may impact our ability to secure adequate supplies of raw materials or parts, lead to supply shortages, or adversely impact the prices at which our businesses can procure compliant goods.    "
9,DOV,DOVER CORP,2016-02-12,"ITEM 1A.   RISK FACTORSThe risk factors discussed in this section should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this Form 10-K and should not be considered the only risks to which we are exposed. In general, we are subject to the same general risks and uncertainties that impact many other industrial companies such as general economic, industry and/or market conditions, and growth rates; the impact of natural disasters, and their effect on global markets; possible future terrorist threats and their effect on the worldwide economy; and changes in laws or accounting rules. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business, including our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition. •Our results may be impacted by current domestic and international economic conditions and uncertainties.Our businesses may be adversely affected by disruptions in the financial markets or declines in economic activity both domestically and internationally in those countries in which we operate. These circumstances will also impact our suppliers and customers in various ways which could have an impact on our business operations, particularly if global credit markets are not operating efficiently and effectively to support industrial commerce.  Our Energy segment is subject to risk due to the volatility of global energy prices and regulations that impact drilling and production, with overall demand for our products and services impacted by depletion rates, global economic conditions and related energy demands.Negative changes in worldwide economic and capital market conditions are beyond our control, are highly unpredictable, and can have an adverse effect on our revenue, earnings, cash flows, and cost of capital.•Trends in oil and natural gas prices may affect the drilling and production activity, profitability and financial stability of our customers and therefore the demand for, and profitability of, our energy products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated results of operations, and consolidated financial condition. The oil and gas industry historically has experienced periodic downturns, including the significant downturn experienced in 2015. Demand for our energy products and services is sensitive to the level of drilling and production activity of, and the corresponding capital spending by, oil and natural gas companies.  The level of drilling and production activity is directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices, which have been recently volatile and may continue to be volatile.  In particular, the prices of oil and natural gas were highly volatile in 2014 and 2015 and declined dramatically.  Prices for oil and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty, geopolitical developments and a variety of other factors that are beyond our control. Even the perception of longer-term lower oil and natural gas prices can reduce or defer major capital expenditures by our customers in the oil and gas industry. Given the long-term nature of many large-scale development projects, a significant downturn in the oil and gas industry could result in the reduction in demand for our energy and pumps products and services, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. •We are subject to risks relating to our existing international operations and expansion into new geographical markets.Approximately 39% of our revenues from continuing operations for 2015 and 40% of our revenues for 2014 were derived outside the United States. We continue to focus on penetrating global markets as part of our overall growth strategy and expect sales from outside the United States to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues. In addition, many of our manufacturing operations and suppliers are located outside the United States.  Our international operations and our global expansion strategy are subject to general risks related to such operations, including:12Table of Contentso  political, social, and economic instability and disruptions;  o  government embargoes or trade restrictions;  o  the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers;  o  import and export controls;  o  limitations on ownership and on repatriation or dividend of earnings;  o  transportation delays and interruptions;  o  labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments;  o  increased compliance costs, including costs associated with disclosure requirements and related due diligence;  o  the impact of loss of a single-source manufacturing facility;  o  difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations;  o  limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies; and  o  access to or control of networks and confidential information due to local government controls and vulnerability of local networks to cyber risks.If we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding our global business or adequately manage operational risks of our existing international operations, the risks could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy involving expansion into new geographical markets or our results of operations and financial position.•Our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on cross-border transactions and the translation of local currency results into U.S. dollars could negatively impact our results of operations.We conduct business through our subsidiaries in many different countries, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a significant impact on the reported results of operations, which are presented in U.S. dollars. For example, foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact on our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015. A significant and growing portion of our products are manufactured in lower-cost locations and sold in various countries. Cross-border transactions, both with external parties and intercompany relationships, result in increased exposure to foreign exchange effects. Accordingly, significant changes in currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro, Pound Sterling, Swiss franc, Chinese Renminbi (Yuan), and the Canadian dollar, could cause fluctuations in the reported results of our businesses’ operations that could negatively affect our results of operations.  Additionally, the strengthening of certain currencies such as the Euro and U.S. dollar potentially exposes us to competitive threats from lower cost producers in other countries. Our sales are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign locations are translated into U.S. dollars.•Increasing product/service and price competition by international and domestic competitors, including new entrants, and our inability to introduce new and competitive products could cause our businesses to generate lower revenue, operating profits, and cash flows.Our competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of the products that our businesses manufacture and the markets they serve. In general, most of our businesses compete with only a few companies. Our ability to compete effectively depends on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various competitive factors, including new products and services that may be introduced by competitors, changes in customer preferences, new business models and technologies, and pricing pressures. If our businesses are unable to anticipate their competitors’ development of new products and services, and/or identify customer needs and preferences on a timely basis, or successfully introduce new products and services in response to such competitive factors, they could lose customers to competitors. If our businesses do not compete effectively, we may experience lower revenue, operating profits, and cash flows.•Our businesses and their profitability and reputation could be adversely affected by domestic and foreign governmental and public policy changes (including environmental and employment regulations and tax policies such as export subsidy programs, research and experimentation credits, carbon emission regulations, and other similar programs), risks associated with emerging markets, changes in statutory tax rates, and unanticipated outcomes with respect to tax audits.Our businesses’ domestic and international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws (including environmental and export/import laws), regulations, and policies. Failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal, monetary, and non-monetary penalties as well as potential damage to our reputation. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with new and evolving regulatory reporting requirements and current or future laws, including environmental protection, employment, data security, data privacy, and 13Table of Contentshealth and safety laws, will not exceed our estimates. In addition, we have invested in certain countries, including Brazil, Russia, India, and China, and may in the future invest in other countries, any of which may carry high levels of currency, political, compliance, or economic risk. While these risks or the impact of these risks are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could adversely affect our businesses and reputation. Our effective tax rate is impacted by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets, and changes in tax laws. The amount of income taxes and other taxes paid can be adversely impacted by changes in statutory tax rates and laws and are subject to ongoing audits by domestic and international authorities. If these audits result in assessments different from amounts estimated, then our financial results may be adversely affected by unfavorable tax adjustments.•Some of our businesses may not anticipate, adapt to, or capitalize on technological developments and this could cause these businesses to become less competitive and lead to reduced market share, revenue, operating profits, and cash flows.Certain of our businesses sell their products in industries that are constantly experiencing change as new technologies are developed. In order to grow and remain competitive in these industries, they must adapt to future changes in technology to enhance their existing products and introduce new products to address their customers’ changing demands. If these businesses are unable to adapt to the rapid technological changes, it could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. •We could lose customers or generate lower revenue, operating profits, and cash flows if there are significant increases in the cost of raw materials (including energy) or if we are unable to obtain raw materials.We purchase raw materials, sub-assemblies, and components for use in our manufacturing operations, which expose us to volatility in prices for certain commodities. Significant price increases for these commodities could adversely affect operating profits for certain of our businesses.  While we generally attempt to mitigate the impact of increased raw material prices by hedging or passing along the increased costs to customers, there may be a time delay between the increased raw material prices and the ability to increase the prices of products, or we may be unable to increase the prices of products due to a competitor’s pricing pressure or other factors. In addition, while raw materials are generally available now, the inability to obtain necessary raw materials could affect our ability to meet customer commitments and satisfy market demand for certain products. Consequently, a significant price increase in raw materials, or their unavailability, may result in a loss of customers and adversely impact revenue, operating profits, and cash flows.•Our growth and results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in our capital allocation and acquisition program.We expect to continue our strategy of seeking to acquire value creating add-on businesses that broaden our existing position and global reach as well as, in the right circumstances, strategically pursue larger acquisitions that could have the potential to either complement our existing businesses or allow us to pursue a new platform.  However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase, that we will be able to acquire such businesses on acceptable terms, or that all closing conditions will be satisfied with respect to any pending acquisition. If we are unsuccessful in our acquisition efforts, then our ability to continue to grow at rates similar to prior years could be adversely affected.  In addition, we face the risk that a completed acquisition may underperform relative to expectations.  We may be unable to achieve synergies originally anticipated, exposed to unexpected liabilities or unable to sufficiently integrate completed acquisitions into our current business and growth model. Further, if we fail to allocate our capital appropriately, in respect of either our acquisition program or organic growth in our operations, we could be overexposed in certain markets and geographies and unable to expand into adjacent products or markets.  These factors could potentially have an adverse impact on our operating profits and cash flows.•Our operating profits and cash flows could be adversely affected if we cannot achieve projected savings and synergies.We are continually evaluating our cost structure and seeking ways to capture synergies across our operations.

If we are unsuccessful in these efforts, our operating results could be adversely affected and we could miss opportunities for growth and efficiencies. •Our business operations may be adversely affected by information systems interruptions or intrusion.  We depend on various information technologies throughout our company to administer, store and support multiple business activities.  If these systems are damaged, cease to function properly, or are subject to cyber-security attacks, such as those involving unauthorized access, malicious software and/or other intrusions, we could experience production downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems or networks, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, and/or damage to our reputation.

Given the long-term nature of many large-scale development projects, a significant downturn in the oil and gas industry could result in the reduction in demand for our energy products and services, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 11Table of Contents•We are subject to risks relating to our existing international operations and expansion into new geographical markets.Approximately 40% of our revenues from continuing operations for 2014 and 41% of our revenues for 2013 were derived outside the United States. We continue to focus on penetrating global markets as part of our overall growth strategy and expect sales from outside the United States to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues. In addition, many of our manufacturing operations and suppliers are located outside the United States.  Our international operations and our global expansion strategy are subject to general risks related to such operations, including:o  political, social, and economic instability and disruptions;  o  government embargoes or trade restrictions;  o  the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers;  o  import and export controls;  o  limitations on ownership and on repatriation or dividend of earnings;  o  transportation delays and interruptions;  o  labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments;  o  increased compliance costs, including costs associated with disclosure requirements and related due diligence;  o  the impact of loss of a single-source manufacturing facility;  o  difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations;  o  limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies; and  o  access to or control of networks and confidential information due to local government controls and vulnerability of local networks to cyber risks.If we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding our global business or adequately manage operational risks of our existing international operations, the risks could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy involving expansion into new geographical markets or our results of operations and financial position.•Increasing product/service and price competition by international and domestic competitors, including new entrants, and our inability to introduce new and competitive products could cause our businesses to generate lower revenue, operating profits, and cash flows.Our competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of the products that our businesses manufacture and the markets they serve. In general, most of our businesses compete with only a few companies. Our ability to compete effectively depends on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various competitive factors, including new products and services that may be introduced by competitors, changes in customer preferences, new business models and technologies, and pricing pressures. If our businesses are unable to anticipate their competitors’ development of new products and services, and/or identify customer needs and preferences on a timely basis, or successfully introduce new products and services in response to such competitive factors, they could lose customers to competitors. If our businesses do not compete effectively, we may experience lower revenue, operating profits, and cash flows.Customer requirements and new regulations may increase our expenses and impact the availability of certain raw materials, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating profits.Our businesses use parts or materials that are impacted by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the ""Dodd-Frank Act"") requirement for disclosure of the use of ""conflict minerals"" mined in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries.  It is possible that some of our businesses' customers will require ""conflict free"" metals in products purchased from us.  We are in the process of determining the country of origin of certain metals used by our businesses, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The supply chain due diligence and verification of sources may require several years to complete based on the current availability of smelter origin information and the number of vendors.  We may not be able to complete the process in the time frame required because of the complexity of our supply chain.  Other governmental social responsibility regulations also may impact our suppliers, manufacturing operations, and operating profits. The need to find alternative sources for certain raw materials or products because of customer requirements and regulations may impact our ability to secure adequate supplies of raw materials or parts, lead to supply shortages, or adversely impact the prices at which our businesses can procure compliant goods.     12Table of Contents•Our businesses and their profitability and reputation could be adversely affected by domestic and foreign governmental and public policy changes (including environmental and employment regulations and tax policies such as export subsidy programs, research and experimentation credits, carbon emission regulations, and other similar programs), risks associated with emerging markets, changes in statutory tax rates, and unanticipated outcomes with respect to tax audits.Our businesses’ domestic and international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws (including environmental and export/import laws), regulations, and policies. Failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal, monetary, and non-monetary penalties as well as potential damage to our reputation. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with new and evolving regulatory reporting requirements and current or future laws, including environmental protection, employment, data security, data privacy, and health and safety laws, will not exceed our estimates. In addition, we have invested in certain countries, including Brazil, Russia, India, and China, and may in the future invest in other countries, any of which may carry high levels of currency, political, compliance, and economic risk. While these risks or the impact of these risks are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could adversely affect our businesses and reputation. Our effective tax rate is impacted by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets, and changes in tax laws. The amount of income taxes and other taxes paid can be adversely impacted by changes in statutory tax rates and laws and are subject to ongoing audits by domestic and international authorities. If these audits result in assessments different from amounts estimated, then our financial results may be adversely affected by unfavorable tax adjustments. •Our revenue, operating profits, and cash flows could be adversely affected if our businesses are unable to protect or obtain patent and other intellectual property rights.Our businesses own patents, trademarks, licenses, and other forms of intellectual property related to their products. Our businesses employ various measures to maintain and protect their intellectual property. These measures may not prevent their intellectual property from being challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected. Unauthorized use of these intellectual property rights could adversely impact the competitive position of our businesses and have a negative impact on our revenue, operating profits, and cash flows.•Some of our businesses may not anticipate, adapt to, or capitalize on technological developments and this could cause these businesses to become less competitive and lead to reduced market share, revenue, operating profits, and cash flows.Certain of our businesses sell their products in industries that are constantly experiencing change as new technologies are developed. In order to grow and remain competitive in these industries, they must adapt to future changes in technology to enhance their existing products and introduce new products to address their customers’ changing demands. If these businesses are unable to adapt to the rapid technological changes, it could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. •We could lose customers or generate lower revenue, operating profits, and cash flows if there are significant increases in the cost of raw materials (including energy) or if we are unable to obtain raw materials.We purchase raw materials, sub-assemblies, and components for use in our manufacturing operations, which expose us to volatility in prices for certain commodities. Significant price increases for these commodities could adversely affect operating profits for certain of our businesses.  While we generally attempt to mitigate the impact of increased raw material prices by hedging or passing along the increased costs to customers, there may be a time delay between the increased raw material prices and the ability to increase the prices of products, or we may be unable to increase the prices of products due to a competitor’s pricing pressure or other factors. In addition, while raw materials are generally available now, the inability to obtain necessary raw materials could affect our ability to meet customer commitments and satisfy market demand for certain products. Consequently, a significant price increase in raw materials, or their unavailability, may result in a loss of customers and adversely impact revenue, operating profits, and cash flows.13Table of Contents•Our growth and results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in our capital allocation and acquisition program.We expect to continue our strategy of seeking to acquire value creating add-on businesses that broaden our existing position and global reach as well as, in the right circumstances, strategically pursue larger acquisitions that could have the potential to either complement our existing businesses or allow us to pursue a new platform.  However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase, that we will be able to acquire such businesses on acceptable terms, or that all closing conditions will be satisfied with respect to any pending acquisition. If we are unsuccessful in our acquisition efforts, then our ability to continue to grow at rates similar to prior years could be adversely affected.  In addition, we face the risk that a completed acquisition may underperform relative to expectations.  We may be unable to achieve synergies originally anticipated, exposed to unexpected liabilities and unable to to sufficiently integrate completed acquisitions into our current business and growth model. Further, if we fail to allocate our capital appropriately, in respect of either our acquisition program or organic growth in our operations, we could be overexposed in certain markets and geographies and unable to expand into adjacent products or markets.  These factors could potentially have an adverse impact on our operating profits and cash flows.•Our operating profits and cash flows could be adversely affected if we cannot achieve projected savings and synergies.We are continually evaluating our cost structure and seeking ways to capture synergies across our operations. If we are unable to reduce costs and expenses through our various programs, it could adversely affect our operating profits and cash flows.•Unforeseen developments in contingencies such as litigation could adversely affect our financial condition.We and certain of our subsidiaries are, and from time to time may become, parties to a number of legal proceedings incidental to their businesses involving alleged injuries arising out of the use of their products, exposure to hazardous substances, or patent infringement, employment matters, and commercial disputes. The defense of these lawsuits may require significant expenses and divert management’s attention, and we may be required to pay damages that could adversely affect our financial condition. In addition, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures. •The indemnification provisions of acquisition and disposition agreements by which we have acquired or sold companies may not fully protect us and may result in unexpected liabilities.Certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it. In most of these agreements, however, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. Similarly, the purchasers of our discontinued operations may from time to time agree to indemnify us for operations of such businesses after the closing. We cannot be assured that any of these indemnification provisions will fully protect us, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our profitability and financial position.  •The proposed disposition of certain of our businesses may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline or terms, or at all.There can be no assurance that the contemplated dispositions will be completed on the anticipated terms or timeframe, or at all. •Failure to attract, retain, and develop personnel or to provide adequate succession plans for key management could have an adverse effect on our operating results.Our growth, profitability, and effectiveness in conducting our operations and executing our strategic plans depend in part on our ability to attract, retain, and develop qualified personnel, align them with appropriate opportunities, and maintain adequate succession plans for key management positions and support for strategic initiatives. If we are unsuccessful in these efforts, our operating results could be adversely affected and we could miss opportunities for growth and efficiencies. •Our business operations may be adversely affected by information systems interruptions or intrusion.  We depend on various information technologies throughout our company to administer, store and support multiple business activities.  If these systems are damaged, cease to function properly, or are subject to cyber-security attacks, such as those involving unauthorized access, malicious software and/or other intrusions, we could experience production downtimes, 14Table of Contentsoperational delays, other detrimental impacts on our operations or ability to provide products and services to our customers, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems or networks, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, and/or damage to our reputation.  While we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, technical security controls, and maintenance of backup and protective systems, our systems, networks, products and services remain potentially vulnerable to known or unknown threats, any of which could have a material adverse affect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. •Our reputation, ability to do business, and results of operations may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents, or business partners.While we strive to maintain high standards, we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by our employees, agents, or business partners that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws or fail to protect our confidential information, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, anti-kickback and false claims rules, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering, and data privacy laws, as well as the improper use of proprietary information or social media.  Any such violations of law or improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions, could lead to substantial civil or criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to increased costs of compliance and could damage our reputation.  •Our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on cross-border transactions and the translation of local currency results into U.S. dollars could negatively impact our results of operations.We conduct business through our subsidiaries in many different countries, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a significant impact on the reported results of operations, which are presented in U.S. dollars. A significant and growing portion of our products are manufactured in lower-cost locations and sold in various countries. Cross-border transactions, both with external parties and intercompany relationships, result in increased exposure to foreign exchange effects. Accordingly, significant changes in currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro, Pound Sterling, Swiss franc, Chinese Renminbi (Yuan), and the Canadian dollar, could cause fluctuations in the reported results of our businesses’ operations that could negatively affect our results of operations.  Additionally, the strengthening of certain currencies such as the Euro and U.S. dollar potentially exposes us to competitive threats from lower cost producers in other countries. Our sales are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign locations are translated into U.S. dollars.•Our borrowing costs may be impacted by our credit ratings developed by various rating agencies.Three major ratings agencies (Moody’s, Standard and Poor’s, and Fitch Ratings) evaluate our credit profile on an ongoing basis and have each assigned high ratings for our long-term debt as of December 31, 2014.  Although we do not anticipate a material change in our credit ratings, if our current credit ratings deteriorate, then our borrowing costs could increase, including increased fees under our five-year credit facility, and our access to future sources of liquidity may be adversely affected.•In connection with the Knowles spin-off, the tax rules applicable to the distribution of shares to our shareholders may restrict us from engaging in certain corporate transactions or from raising equity capital beyond certain thresholds for a period of time after the spin-off, as applicable.We received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (""IRS"") substantively to the effect that, among other things, the distribution of shares to our shareholders, will qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code (the ""Code"").  To preserve the tax-free treatment of the distribution of shares to our shareholders, we will be subject to restrictions with respect to our activities, including restrictions relating to certain issuances or repurchases of our common stock, asset sales, mergers and liquidations.These restrictions may limit our ability to pursue strategic transactions of a certain magnitude that involve the issuance or acquisition of our stock or engage in new businesses or other transactions that might increase the value of our business.  These restrictions may also limit our ability to raise significant amounts of cash through the issuance of stock, especially if our stock price were to suffer substantial declines, or through the sale of certain of our assets.15Table of Contents•Indemnification agreements with Knowles may not fully protect us against certain liabilities.In connection with the spin-off, Knowles agreed to indemnify us for any losses relating to the conduct of the Knowles business.  There can be no assurance that the indemnity agreements will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of any liabilities that may arise, or that the indemnitors will be able to fully satisfy their indemnification obligations. The failure to receive amounts for which we are entitled to indemnification could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition"
6,DOV,DOVER CORP,2014-02-14,"ITEM 1A.   RISK FACTORSOur business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results. In general, we are subject to the same general risks and uncertainties that impact many other industrial companies such as general economic, industry and/or market conditions, and growth rates; the impact of natural disasters, and their effect on global markets; possible future terrorist threats and their effect on the worldwide economy; and changes in laws or accounting rules. The risk factors discussed in this section should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this Form 10-K and should not be considered the only risks to which we are exposed.•Our results may be impacted by current domestic and international economic conditions and uncertainties.Our businesses may be adversely affected by disruptions in the financial markets or declines in economic activity both domestically and internationally in those countries in which we operate. These circumstances will also impact our suppliers and customers in various ways which could have an impact on our business operations, particularly if global credit markets are not operating efficiently and effectively to support industrial commerce.  Our Energy segment is subject to risk due to the volatility of global energy prices and regulations that impact production, although overall demand is more directly related to depletion rates and global economic conditions and related energy demands.Negative changes in worldwide economic and capital market conditions are beyond our control, are highly unpredictable, and can have an adverse effect on our revenue, earnings, cash flows, and cost of capital.•We are subject to risks relating to our existing international operations and expansion into new geographical markets.Approximately 48% of our revenues for 2013 and 46% of our revenues for 2012 were derived outside the United States. We continue to focus on penetrating global markets as part of our overall growth strategy and expect sales from outside the United States to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues. In addition, many of our manufacturing operations and suppliers are located outside the United States.  Our international operations and our global expansion strategy are subject to general risks related to such operations, including:o  political, social, and economic instability and disruptions;  o  government embargoes or trade restrictions;  o  the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers;  o  import and export controls;  o  limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings;  o  transportation delays and interruptions;  o  labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments;  o  increased compliance costs, including costs associated with disclosure requirements and related due diligence;  o  the impact of loss of a single-source manufacturing facility;  o  difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations; and  o  limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies.  If we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding our global business or adequately manage operational risks of our existing international operations, the risks could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy involving expansion into new geographical markets or our results of operations and financial position.•Increasing product/service and price competition by international and domestic competitors, including new entrants, and our inability to introduce new and competitive products could cause our businesses to generate lower revenue, operating profits, and cash flows.Our competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of the products that our businesses manufacture and the markets they serve.

If our businesses are unable to anticipate their competitors’ development of new products and services, and/or identify customer needs and preferences on a timely basis, or successfully introduce new products and services in response to such competitive factors, they could lose customers to competitors. If our businesses do not compete effectively, we may experience lower revenue, operating profits, and cash flows.•Some of our businesses may not anticipate, adapt to, or capitalize on technological developments and this could cause these businesses to become less competitive and lead to reduced market share, revenue, operating profits, and cash flows.Certain of our Communication Technologies businesses sell their products in electronic and technology-based industries that are constantly experiencing change as new technologies are developed. In order to grow and remain competitive in these industries, they must adapt to future changes in technology to enhance their existing products and introduce new products to address their customers’ changing demands.

Failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal, monetary, and non-monetary penalties as well as potential damage to our reputation. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with new and evolving regulatory reporting requirements and current or future laws, including environmental protection, employment, and health and safety laws, will not exceed our estimates.

There can be no assurance that the spin-off of Knowles will be completed in the contemplated manner or timeframe, or at all.  If the spin-off transaction is not completed in the contemplated manner or timeframe or not completed at all, among other things, the price of Dover's stock may decline.  16Table of ContentsWe have and will continue to incur significant expenses in connection with the proposed transaction which may exceed our current expectations. We cannot predict with certainty when the benefits expected from the proposed transaction will occur or the extent to which they will be achieved, if at all. For example, there can be no assurance that analysts and investors will place values on each of the independent companies that will equal a total value that is greater than that which Dover has today.  In addition, if the proposed spin-off is consummated, our operational and financial profile will change and we will face new risks, including the possibility of reduced financial resources and less diversification of our revenue sources which could adversely impact our future results. In addition, the changes in our operational and financial profile may not meet some of our shareholders' investment strategies, which could cause investors to sell their shares and otherwise decrease demand for our common stock. Excess selling could cause the relative market price of our common stock to decrease and be subject to greater volatility following the consummation of the proposed spin-off.  •If the spin-off, together with certain related transactions, does not qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we and our shareholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities. A condition to the spin-off is the receipt by us of either (i) a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (""IRS"") together with an opinion of Baker & McKenzie LLP, our tax counsel, substantively to the effect that, among other things, the distribution of shares to our shareholders, will qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code (the ""Code""), or (ii) an opinion of Baker & McKenzie LLP, our tax counsel, substantively to the effect that, among other things, the spin-off will qualify as tax-free for U.S. Federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 36x(c)(i)(D) of the Code. We received an opinion from Baker & McKenzie LLP that the spin-off will so qualify, which opinion is expected to be confirmed on the distribution date of the Knowles spin-off. The opinion relies on certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings of us and Knowles, including those regarding the past and future conduct of certain of our businesses and other matters. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are incorrect or not satisfied, we may not be able to rely on the opinion, and we and our shareholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Notwithstanding the opinion of tax counsel, the IRS could determine on audit that the distribution is taxable if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion. In addition, we and Knowles intend for certain related transactions to qualify for tax-free treatment under federal, state and local tax law and/or foreign tax law. If the distribution is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we and our shareholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. For example, if the distribution fails to qualify for tax-free treatment, we would, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, be treated as if we had sold the Knowles common stock in a taxable sale for its fair market value, and our shareholders who are subject to U.S. federal income tax would be treated as receiving a taxable distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of the Knowles common stock received in the distribution. In addition, if certain related transactions fail to qualify for tax-free treatment under federal, state and local tax law and/or foreign tax law, we could incur significant tax liabilities under U.S. federal, state, local and/or foreign tax law.  "
12,DOV,DOVER CORP,2013-02-15,"ITEM 1A.   RISK FACTORSOur business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from anticipated future results. In general, we are subject to the same general risks and uncertainties that impact many other industrial companies such as general economic, industry and/or market conditions, and growth rates; the impact of natural disasters, and their effect on global markets; possible future terrorist threats and their effect on the worldwide economy; and changes in laws or accounting rules. The risk factors discussed in this section should be considered together with information included elsewhere in this Form 10-K and should not be considered the only risks to which we are exposed.•Our results may be impacted by current domestic and international economic conditions and uncertainties.Our businesses may be adversely affected by disruptions in the financial markets or declines in economic activity both domestically and internationally in those countries in which we operate. These circumstances will also impact our suppliers and customers in various ways which could have an impact on our business operations, particularly if global credit markets are not operating efficiently and effectively to support industrial commerce.  Our Energy segment is subject to risk due to the volatility of global energy prices and regulations that impact production, although overall demand is more directly related to depletion rates and global economic conditions and related energy demands.Negative changes in worldwide economic and capital market conditions are beyond our control, are highly unpredictable, and can have an adverse effect on our revenue, earnings, cash flows, and cost of capital.•We are subject to risks relating to our existing international operations and expansion into new geographical markets.Approximately 46% of our revenues for 2012 and 47% of our revenues for 2011 were derived outside the United States. We continue to focus on penetrating global markets as part of our overall growth strategy and expect sales from outside the United States to continue to represent a significant portion of our revenues. In addition, many of our manufacturing operations and suppliers are located outside the United States.  Our international operations and our global expansion strategy are subject to general risks related to such operations, including:o  political, social, and economic instability and disruptions;  o  government embargoes or trade restrictions;  o  the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers;  o  import and export controls;  o  limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings;  o  transportation delays and interruptions;  o  labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments;  o  increased compliance costs, including costs associated with disclosure requirements and related due diligence;  o  the impact of loss of a single-source manufacturing facility;  o  difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations; and  o  limitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies.  If we are unable to successfully manage the risks associated with expanding our global business or adequately manage operational risks of our existing international operations, the risks could have a material adverse effect on our growth strategy involving expansion into new geographical markets or our results of operations and financial position.•Increasing product/service and price competition by international and domestic competitors, including new entrants, and our inability to introduce new and competitive products could cause our businesses to generate lower revenue, operating profits, and cash flows.Our competitive environment is complex because of the wide diversity of the products that our businesses manufacture and the markets they serve. In general, most of our businesses compete with only a few companies. Our ability to compete effectively depends on how successfully we anticipate and respond to various competitive factors, including new products and services that may be introduced by competitors, changes in customer preferences, and pricing pressures. If our businesses 13Table of Contentsare unable to anticipate their competitors’ development of new products and services, and/or identify customer needs and preferences on a timely basis, or successfully introduce new products and services in response to such competitive factors, they could lose customers to competitors. If our businesses do not compete effectively, we may experience lower revenue, operating profits, and cash flows.•Some of our businesses may not anticipate, adapt to, or capitalize on technological developments and this could cause these businesses to become less competitive and lead to reduced market share, revenue, operating profits, and cash flows.Certain of our Communication Technologies businesses sell their products in electronic and technology-based industries that are constantly experiencing change as new technologies are developed. In order to grow and remain competitive in these industries, they must adapt to future changes in technology to enhance their existing products and introduce new products to address their customers’ changing demands. If these businesses are unable to adapt to the rapid technological changes, it could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position, and cash flows. •We could lose customers or generate lower revenue, operating profits, and cash flows if there are significant increases in the cost of raw materials (including energy) or if we are unable to obtain raw materials.We purchase raw materials, sub-assemblies, and components for use in our manufacturing operations, which expose us to volatility in prices for certain commodities. Significant price increases for these commodities could adversely affect operating profits for certain of our businesses.  While we generally attempt to mitigate the impact of increased raw material prices by hedging or passing along the increased costs to customers, there may be a time delay between the increased raw material prices and the ability to increase the prices of products, or we may be unable to increase the prices of products due to a competitor’s pricing pressure or other factors. In addition, while raw materials are generally available now, the inability to obtain necessary raw materials could affect our ability to meet customer commitments and satisfy market demand for certain products. Consequently, a significant price increase in raw materials, or their unavailability, may result in a loss of customers and adversely impact revenue, operating profits, and cash flows.•Customer requirements and new regulations may increase our expenses and impact the availability of certain raw materials, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating profits.Our businesses use parts or materials that are impacted by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) requirement for disclosure of the use of “conflict minerals” mined in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries.  It is possible that some of our businesses' customers will require “conflict free” metals in products purchased from us.  We have begun the process of determining the country of origin of certain metals used by our businesses, as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The supply chain due diligence and verification of sources may require several years to complete based on the current availability of smelter origin information and the number of vendors.  We may not be able to complete the process in the time frame required because of the complexity of our supply chain.  Other governmental social responsibility regulations also may impact our suppliers, manufacturing operations, and operating profits. The need to find alternative sources for certain raw materials or products because of customer requirements and regulations may impact our ability to secure adequate supplies of raw materials or parts, lead to supply shortages, or adversely impact the prices at which our businesses can procure compliant goods.     •Our businesses and their profitability and reputation could be adversely affected by domestic and foreign governmental and public policy changes (including environmental and employment regulations and tax policies such as export subsidy programs, research and experimentation credits, carbon emission regulations, and other similar programs), risks associated with emerging markets, changes in statutory tax rates, and unanticipated outcomes with respect to tax audits.Our businesses’ domestic and international sales and operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local government laws (including environmental and export/import laws), regulations, and policies. Failure to comply with any of these laws could result in civil and criminal, monetary, and non-monetary penalties as well as potential damage to our reputation. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that our costs of complying with new and evolving regulatory reporting requirements and current or future laws, including environmental protection, employment, and health and safety laws, will not exceed our estimates. In addition, we have invested in certain countries, including Brazil, Russia, India, and China, that carry high levels of currency, political, compliance, and economic risk. While these risks or the impact of these risks are difficult to predict, any one or more of them could adversely affect our businesses and reputation. Our effective tax rate is impacted by changes in the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets, and changes in tax laws. The amount of income taxes and other taxes paid 14Table of Contentscan be adversely impacted by changes in statutory tax rates and laws and are subject to ongoing audits by domestic and international authorities. If these audits result in assessments different from amounts estimated, then our financial results may be adversely affected by unfavorable tax adjustments. •Our revenue, operating profits, and cash flows could be adversely affected if our businesses are unable to protect or obtain patent and other intellectual property rights.Our businesses own patents, trademarks, licenses, and other forms of intellectual property related to their products. Our businesses employ various measures to maintain and protect their intellectual property. These measures may not prevent their intellectual property from being challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not highly developed or protected. Unauthorized use of these intellectual property rights could adversely impact the competitive position of our businesses and have a negative impact on our revenue, operating profits, and cash flows.•Our growth and results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in our capital allocation and acquisition program.We expect to continue our strategy of seeking to acquire value creating add-on businesses that broaden our existing position and global reach as well as, in the right circumstances, strategically pursue larger acquisitions that could have the potential to either complement our existing businesses or allow us to pursue a new platform.  However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to find suitable businesses to purchase, that we will be able to acquire such businesses on acceptable terms, or that all closing conditions will be satisfied with respect to any pending acquisition. If we are unsuccessful in our acquisition efforts, then our ability to continue to grow at rates similar to prior years could be adversely affected.  In addition a completed acquisition may underperform relative to expectations, may be unable to achieve synergies originally anticipated, or may expose us to unexpected liabilities. Further, if we fail to allocate our capital appropriately, in respect of either our acquisition program or organic growth in our operations, we could be overexposed in certain markets and geographies.  These factors could potentially have an adverse impact on our operating profits and cash flows.•Our operating profits and cash flows could be adversely affected if we cannot achieve projected savings and synergies.We are continually evaluating our cost structure and seeking ways to capture synergies across our operations. If we are unable to reduce costs and expenses through our various programs, it could adversely affect our operating profits and cash flows.•Unforeseen developments in contingencies such as litigation could adversely affect our financial condition.We and certain of our subsidiaries are, and from time to time may become, parties to a number of legal proceedings incidental to their businesses involving alleged injuries arising out of the use of their products, exposure to hazardous substances, or patent infringement, employment matters, and commercial disputes. The defense of these lawsuits may require significant expenses and divert management’s attention, and we may be required to pay damages that could adversely affect our financial condition. In addition, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against potential loss exposures. •The indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and may result in unexpected liabilities.Certain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it. In most of these agreements, however, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. We cannot be assured that these indemnification provisions will fully protect us, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our profitability and financial position.   •Failure to attract, retain, and develop personnel or to provide adequate succession plans for key management could have an adverse effect on our operating results.Our growth, profitability, and effectiveness in conducting our operations and executing our strategic plans depend in part on our ability to attract, retain, and develop qualified personnel, align them with appropriate opportunities, and maintain adequate succession plans for key management positions. If we are unsuccessful in these efforts, our operating results could be adversely affected. 15Table of Contents•Our business operations may be adversely affected by information systems interruptions or intrusion.  Our businesses rely on a number of information technologies to manage, store, and support business activities.  We have put in place a number of systems, processes, and practices designed to protect against intentional or unintentional misappropriation or corruption of our systems and information, disruption of our operations, or corruption of the software that supports our products.  Disruptions or cybersecurity attacks, such as unauthorized access, malicious software, or other violations may lead to exposure of proprietary or confidential information as well as potential data corruption.  Any intrusion may cause operational stoppages, violations of applicable law, diminished competitive advantages or reputational damages, and increased operational costs for remedial activities.   •Our reputation, ability to do business, and results of operations may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents, or business partners.While we strive to maintain high standards, we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by our employees, agents, or business partners that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws or fail to protect our confidential information, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, anti-kickback and false claims rules, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering, and data privacy laws, as well as the improper use of proprietary information or social media.  Any such violations of law or improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions, could lead to substantial civil or criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, and related shareholder lawsuits and could damage our reputation.  •Our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on cross-border transactions and the translation of local currency results into U.S. dollars could negatively impact our results of operations.We conduct business through our subsidiaries in many different countries, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates could have a significant impact on the reported results of operations, which are presented in U.S. dollars. A significant and growing portion of our products are manufactured in lower-cost locations and sold in various countries. Cross-border transactions, both with external parties and intercompany relationships, result in increased exposure to foreign exchange effects. Accordingly, significant changes in currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro, Pound Sterling, Swiss franc, Chinese RMB (Yuan), and the Canadian dollar, could cause fluctuations in the reported results of our businesses’ operations that could negatively affect our results of operations.  Additionally, the strengthening of certain currencies such as the Euro and U.S. dollar potentially exposes us to competitive threats from lower cost producers in other countries such as China. Our sales are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign locations are translated into U.S. dollars.•Our borrowing costs may be impacted by our credit ratings developed by various rating agencies.Three major ratings agencies (Moody’s, Standard and Poor’s, and Fitch Ratings) evaluate our credit profile on an ongoing basis and have each assigned high ratings for our long-term debt as of December 31, 2012.  Although we do not anticipate a material change in our credit ratings, if our current credit ratings deteriorate, then our borrowing costs could increase, including increased fees under our Five-Year Credit Facility, and our access to future sources of liquidity may be adversely affected. "

2,DOV,DOVER CORP,2011-02-11,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors     The Companys business, financial condition, operating    results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors    which could cause its actual results to vary materially from    recent results or from anticipated future results. In general,    the Company is subject to the same general risks and    uncertainties that impact many other industrial companies such    as general economic, industry    and/or    market conditions and growth rates; the impact of natural    disasters, and their effect on global energy markets; possible    future terrorist threats and their effect on the worldwide    economy; and changes in laws or accounting rules. The risk    factors discussed in this section should be considered together    with information included elsewhere in this    Form 10-K    and should not be considered the only risks facing the Company.     The Company has identified the following specific risks and    uncertainties that it considers material:  The    Companys results for 2011 may continue to be impacted    by current domestic and international economic conditions and    uncertainties.     In 2011, the Companys businesses may continue to be    adversely affected by disruptions in the financial markets or    declines in economic activity both domestically and    internationally in those countries in which the Company    operates. These circumstances will also impact the    Companys suppliers and customers in various ways which    could have an impact on the Companys business operations,    particularly if global credit markets are not operating    efficiently and effectively to support industrial commerce. Such    negative changes in worldwide economic and capital market    conditions are beyond the Companys control, are highly    unpredictable, and can have an adverse effect on the    Companys revenue, earnings, cash flows and cost of capital.  Increasing    product/service and price competition by international and    domestic competitors, including new entrants and the ability of    the Company to introduce new and competitive products could    cause the Companys businesses to generate lower revenue,    operating profits and cash flows.     The Companys competitive environment is complex because of    the wide diversity of the products that its companies    manufacture and the markets they serve. In general, most Dover    companies compete with only a few companies. The ability of    Dovers companies to compete effectively depends on how    successfully they anticipate and respond to various competitive    factors, including new products and services that may be    introduced by their competitors, changes in customer    preferences, and pricing pressures. If Dovers companies    are unable to anticipate their competitors development of    new products and services    and/or    identify customer needs and preferences on a timely basis or    successfully introduce new products and services in response to    such competitive factors, they could lose customers to    competitors. If Dovers companies do not compete    effectively, Dover companies may experience lower revenue,    operating profits and cash flows.    11Table of Contents Some    of Dovers companies may not anticipate, adapt to, or    capitalize on technological developments and are subject to the    cyclical nature of their industries. These factors could cause    these companies to become less competitive and lead to reduced    market share, revenue, operating profits and cash    flows.     Certain Dover companies, particularly in the Electronic    Technologies segment, sell their products in industries that are    constantly experiencing change as new technologies are    developed. In order to grow and remain competitive, the    companies in these industries must adapt to future changes in    technology to enhance their existing products and introduce new    products to address their customers changing demands.    Also, a portion of the Electronic Technologies segments    revenue is derived from companies that are subject to    unpredictable short-term business cycles.     The Energy platform in the Fluid Management segment is subject    to risk due to the volatility of energy prices, although overall    demand is more directly related to depletion rates and global    economic conditions and related energy demands. In addition,    certain Dover businesses manufacture products that are used in    or related to residential and commercial construction, which can    be adversely affected by a prolonged downturn in new housing    starts and other construction markets.     As a result of all the above factors, the revenue and operating    performance of these companies in any one period are not    necessarily predictive of their revenue and operating    performance in other periods, and these factors could have a    material impact on the Companys consolidated results of    operations, financial position and cash flows.  Our    companies could lose customers or generate lower revenue,    operating profits and cash flows if there are significant    increases in the cost of raw materials (including energy) or if    they are unable to obtain raw materials.     Dovers companies purchase raw materials, subassemblies and    components for use in their manufacturing operations, which    exposes them to volatility in prices for certain commodities.    Significant price increases for these commodities could    adversely affect operating profits for certain Dover companies.    While the Companys businesses generally attempt to    mitigate the impact of increased raw material prices by hedging    or passing along the increased costs to customers, there may be    a time delay between the increased raw material prices and the    ability to increase the prices of products, or they may be    unable to increase the prices of products due to a    competitors pricing pressure or other factors. In    addition, while raw materials are generally available now, the    inability to obtain necessary raw materials could affect the    ability to meet customer commitments and satisfy market demand    for certain products. Consequently, a significant price increase    in raw materials, or their unavailability, may result in a loss    of customers and adversely impact revenue, operating profits and    cash flows.  The    Company is subject to risks relating to its existing foreign    operations and expansion into new geographical    markets.     Approximately 46% of the Companys revenues for 2010 and    43% of the Companys revenues for 2009 were derived outside    the United States. The Company continues to focus on penetrating    global markets as part of its overall growth strategy and    expects sales from and into foreign markets to continue to    represent a significant portion of its revenues. In addition,    many of the Companys manufacturing operations and    suppliers are located outside the United States. The    Companys foreign operations and its global expansion    strategy are subject to general risks related to international    operations, including:           political, social and economic instability and disruptions;           government embargoes or trade restrictions;           the imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers;           import and export controls;           limitations on ownership and on repatriation of earnings;           transportation delays and interruptions;    12Table of Contents           labor unrest and current and changing regulatory environments;           increased compliance costs;           the impact of loss of a single-source manufacturing facility;           difficulties in staffing and managing multi-national    operations; and           limitations on its ability to enforce legal rights and remedies.     If the Company is unable to successfully manage the risks    associated with expanding its global business or adequately    manage operational risks of its existing international    operations, the risks could have a material adverse effect on    the Companys growth strategy involving expansion into new    geographical markets or the results of operations and financial    position.  The    Companys exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on    cross-border transactions and the translation of local currency    results into U.S. dollars could negatively impact the    Companys results of operations.     The Company conducts business through its subsidiaries in many    different countries, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates    could have a significant impact on the reported results of    operations, which are presented in U.S. dollars. A    significant and growing portion of the Companys products    are manufactured in lower-cost locations and sold in various    countries. Cross-border transactions, both with external parties    and intercompany relationships, result in increased exposure to    foreign exchange effects. Accordingly, significant changes in    currency exchange rates, particularly the Euro, Pound Sterling,    Chinese RMB (Yuan) and the Canadian dollar, could cause    fluctuations in the reported results of the Companys    operations that could negatively affect its results of    operations. Additionally, the strengthening of certain    currencies such as the Euro and U.S. dollar potentially    exposes the Company to competitive threats from lower cost    producers in other countries such as China. The Companys    sales are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting    purposes. The weakening of the U.S. dollar could result in    unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign    locations are translated into U.S. dollars.  The    Companys operating profits and cash flows could be    adversely affected if the Company cannot achieve projected    savings and synergies.     The Company is continually evaluating its cost structure and    seeking ways to capture synergies across its operations. If the    Company is unable to reduce costs and expenses through its    various programs, it could adversely affect the Companys    operating profits and cash flows.  Failure    to attract, retain and develop personnel or to provide adequate    succession plans for key management could have an adverse effect    on the Companys operating results.     The Companys growth, profitability and effectiveness in    conducting its operations and executing its strategic plans    depend in part on its ability to attract, retain and develop    qualified personnel, align them with appropriate opportunities    and maintain adequate succession plans for key management    positions. If the Company is unsuccessful in these efforts, its    operating results could be adversely affected.  The    Companys businesses and their profitability and reputation    could be adversely affected by domestic and foreign governmental    and public policy changes (including environmental and    employment regulations and tax policies such as export subsidy    programs, research and experimentation credits, carbon emission    regulations, and other similar programs), risks associated with    emerging markets, changes in statutory tax rates and    unanticipated outcomes with respect to tax audits.     The Companys domestic and international sales and    operations are subject to risks associated with changes in local    government laws (including environmental and export laws),    regulations and policies. Failure to comply with any of these    laws could result in civil and criminal, monetary and    non-monetary penalties as well as potential damage to the    Companys reputation. In addition, the Company cannot    provide assurance that its costs of complying with new and    evolving regulatory reporting requirements and current or future    laws, including environmental protection, employment, and health    and safety laws, will not exceed its estimates. In addition, the    Company has    13Table of Contents    invested in certain countries, including Brazil, Russia, India    and China that carry high levels of currency, political,    compliance and economic risk. While these risks or the impact of    these risks are difficult to predict, any one or more of them    could adversely affect the Companys businesses and    reputation.     The Companys effective tax rate is impacted by changes in    the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax    rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets    or changes in tax laws. The amount of income taxes and other    taxes paid can be adversely impacted by changes in statutory tax    rates and laws and are subject to ongoing audits by domestic and    international authorities. If these audits result in assessments    different from amounts estimated, then the Companys    financial results may be adversely affected by unfavorable tax    adjustments.  Unforeseen    developments in contingencies such as litigation could adversely    affect the Companys financial condition.     The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are, and from time    to time may become, parties to a number of legal proceedings    incidental to their businesses involving alleged injuries    arising out of the use of their products, exposure to hazardous    substances or patent infringement, employment matters and    commercial disputes. The defense of these lawsuits may require    significant expenses, divert managements attention, and    the Company may be required to pay damages that could adversely    affect its financial condition. In addition, any insurance or    indemnification rights that the Company may have may be    insufficient or unavailable to protect it against potential loss    exposures.  The    Companys revenue, operating profits and cash flows could    be adversely affected if Dovers companies are unable to    protect or obtain patent and other intellectual property    rights.     Dover companies own patents, trademarks, licenses and other    forms of intellectual property related to their products. Dover    companies employ various measures to maintain and protect their    intellectual property. These measures may not prevent their    intellectual property from being challenged, invalidated or    circumvented, particularly in countries where intellectual    property rights are not highly developed or protected.    Unauthorized use of these intellectual property rights could    adversely impact the competitive position of Dovers    companies and have a negative impact on their revenue, operating    profits and cash flows.  The    Companys growth and results of operations may be adversely    affected if the Company is unsuccessful in its capital    allocation and acquisition program or is unable to divest    non-core assets and businesses as planned.     The Company expects to continue its strategy of seeking to    acquire value creating add-on businesses that broaden its    existing companies and their global reach as well as, in the    right circumstances, strategically pursue large businesses that    have the potential to either complement its existing companies    or allow the Company to pursue a new platform. However, there    can be no assurance that the Company will able to continue to    find suitable businesses to purchase, that it will be able to    acquire such businesses on acceptable terms, or that all closing    conditions will be satisfied with respect to any pending    acquisition. If the Company is unsuccessful in its acquisition    efforts, then its ability to continue to grow at rates similar    to prior years could be adversely affected. In addition a    completed acquisition may underperform relative to expectations,    may be unable to achieve synergies originally anticipated, or    may expose the Company to unexpected liabilities. Further, if    the Company fails to allocate its capital appropriately, in    respect of either its acquisition program or organic growth in    its operations, the Company could be overexposed in certain    markets and geographies. These factors could potentially have an    adverse impact on the Companys operating profits and cash    flows.     The inability of the Company to dispose of non-core assets and    businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions and within    expected time frames could also have an adverse affect on the    Companys results of operations.  The    Companys borrowing costs may be impacted by its credit    ratings developed by various rating agencies.     Three major ratings agencies (Moodys, Standard and    Poors, and Fitch Ratings) evaluate the Companys    credit profile on an ongoing basis and have each assigned high    ratings for the Companys long-term debt as of    14Table of Contents    December 31, 2010. Although the Company does not anticipate    a material change in its credit ratings, if the Companys    current credit ratings deteriorate, then its borrowing costs    could increase, including increased fees under the Five-Year    Credit Facility and the Companys access to future sources    of liquidity may be adversely affected. "
5,DOV,DOVER CORP,2010-02-19,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors     The Companys business, financial condition, operating    results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors    which could cause its actual results to vary materially from    recent results or from anticipated future results. In general,    the Company is subject to the same general risks and    uncertainties that impact many other industrial companies such    as general economic, industry    and/or    market conditions and growth rates; the impact of natural    10Table of Contents    disasters, and their effect on global energy markets; continued    events in the Middle East and possible future terrorist threats    and their effect on the worldwide economy; and changes in laws    or accounting rules. The risk factors discussed in this section    should be considered together with information included    elsewhere in this Annual Report on    Form 10-K    and should not be considered the only risks facing the Company.     The Company has identified the following specific risks and    uncertainties that it considers material:  The    Companys results for 2010 may continue to be impacted    by current domestic and international economic conditions and    uncertainties.     In 2010, the Companys businesses may continue to be    adversely affected by disruptions in the financial markets or    declines in economic activity both domestically and    internationally in those countries in which the Company    operates. These circumstances will also impact the    Companys suppliers and customers in various ways which    could have an impact on the Companys business operations,    particularly if global credit markets are not operating    efficiently and effectively to support industrial commerce. Such    negative changes in worldwide economic and capital market    conditions are beyond the Companys control, are highly    unpredictable, and can have an adverse effect on the    Companys revenue, earnings, cash flows and cost of capital.  Increasing    price and product/service competition by international and    domestic competitors, including new entrants and the ability of    the Company to introduce new and competitive products could    cause the Companys businesses to generate lower revenue,    operating profits and cash flows.     The Companys competitive environment is complex because of    the wide diversity of the products that its companies    manufacture and the markets they serve. In general, most Dover    companies compete with only a few companies. The ability of    Dovers companies to compete effectively depends on how    successfully they anticipate and respond to various competitive    factors, including new products and services that may be    introduced by their competitors, changes in customer    preferences, and pricing pressures. If Dovers companies    are unable to anticipate their competitors development of    new products and services    and/or    identify customer needs and preferences on a timely basis or    successfully introduce new products and services in response to    such competitive factors, they could lose customers to    competitors. If Dovers companies do not compete    effectively, Dover companies may experience lower revenue,    operating profits and cash flows.  Some    of Dovers companies may not anticipate, adapt to, or    capitalize on technological developments and are subject to the    cyclical nature of their industries. These factors could cause    these companies to become less competitive and lead to reduced    market share, revenue, operating profits and cash    flows.     Certain Dover companies, particularly in the Electronic    Technologies segment, sell their products in industries that are    constantly experiencing change as new technologies are    developed. In order to grow and remain competitive, the    companies in these industries must adapt to future changes in    technology to enhance their existing products and introduce new    products to address their customers changing demands.    Also, a meaningful portion of the Electronic Technologies    segments revenue is derived from companies that are    subject to unpredictable short-term business cycles.     The Energy platform in the Fluid Management segment is subject    to risk due to the volatility of energy prices, although overall    demand is more directly related to depletion rates and global    economic conditions and related energy demands. In addition,    certain Dover businesses manufacture products that are used in    or related to residential and commercial construction, which can    be adversely affected by a prolonged downturn in new housing    starts and other construction markets.     As a result of all the above factors, the revenue and operating    performance of these companies in any one period are not    necessarily predictive of their revenue and operating    performance in other periods, and these factors could have a    material impact on the Companys consolidated results of    operations, financial position and cash flows.    Our companies could lose customers or generate lower    revenue, operating profits and cash flows if there are    significant increases in the cost of raw materials (including    energy) or if they are unable to obtain raw materials.     Dovers companies purchase raw materials, subassemblies and    components for use in their manufacturing operations, which    exposes them to volatility in prices for certain commodities.    Significant price increases for these    11Table of Contents    commodities could adversely affect operating profits for certain    Dover companies. While the Companys businesses generally    attempt to mitigate the impact of increased raw material prices    by hedging or passing along the increased costs to customers,    there may be a time delay between the increased raw material    prices and the ability to increase the prices of products, or    they may be unable to increase the prices of products due to a    competitors pricing pressure or other factors. In    addition, while raw materials are generally available now, the    inability to obtain necessary raw materials could affect the    ability to meet customer commitments and satisfy market demand    for certain products. Consequently, a significant price increase    in raw materials, or their unavailability, may result in a loss    of customers and adversely impact revenue, operating profits and    cash flows.    The Companys growth strategy with respect to    expansion into new geographic markets could be adversely    affected if Dovers companies are unable to manage the    associated risks, particularly in markets outside the    U.S.     Approximately 43% of the Companys revenue is derived    outside of the United States and the Company continues to focus    on penetrating new global markets as part of its overall growth    strategy. This global expansion strategy is subject to general    risks related to international operations, including, among    others: political, social and economic instability and    disruptions; government embargoes or trade restrictions; the    imposition of duties and tariffs and other trade barriers;    import and export controls; increased compliance costs;    transportation delays and disruptions; and difficulties in    staffing and managing multi-national organizations. If the    Company is unable to successfully mitigate these risks, they    could have an adverse effect on the Companys growth    strategy involving expansion into new geographic markets and on    its results of operations and financial position.    The Companys exposure to exchange rate fluctuations    on cross border transactions and the translation of local    currency results into U.S. dollars could negatively impact    the Companys results of operations.     The Company conducts business through its subsidiaries in many    different countries, and fluctuations in currency exchange rates    could have a significant impact on the reported results of    operations, which are presented in U.S. dollars.

The weakening of the U.S. dollar could result in    unfavorable translation effects as the results of foreign    locations are translated into U.S. dollars.    The Companys operating profits and cash flows could    be adversely affected if the Company cannot achieve projected    savings and synergies.     The Company is continually evaluating its cost structure and    seeking ways to capture synergies across its operations. If the    Company is unable to reduce costs and expenses through its    various programs, it could adversely affect the Companys    operating profits and cash flows.    Failure to attract, retain and develop personnel or to    provide adequate succession plans for key management could have    an adverse affect on the Companys operating    results.     The Companys growth, profitability and effectiveness in    conducting its operations and executing its strategic plans    depend in part on its ability to attract, retain and develop    qualified personnel, align them with appropriate opportunities    and maintain adequate succession plans for key management    positions.

Failure to comply with any of these    laws could result in civil and criminal, monetary and    non-monetary penalties as well as potential damage    12Table of Contents    to the Companys reputation. In addition, the Company    cannot provide assurance that its costs of complying with    current or future laws, including environmental protection,    employment, and health and safety laws, will not exceed its    estimates. In addition, the Company has invested in certain    countries, including Brazil, Russia, India and China that carry    high levels of currency, political, compliance and economic    risk. While these risks or the impact of these risks are    difficult to predict, any one or more of them could adversely    affect the Companys businesses and reputation.     The Companys effective tax rate is impacted by changes in    the mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax    rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets    or changes in tax laws.

In    addition, a completed acquisition may underperform relative to    expectations, be unable to achieve synergies originally    anticipated, or require the payment of additional expenses for    assumed liabilities. Further, failure to allocate capital    appropriately could also result in over exposure in certain    markets and geographies. These factors could potentially have an    adverse impact on the Companys operating profits and cash    flows. The inability to dispose of non-core assets and    businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions and within the    expected time frame could also have an adverse affect on our    results of operations.    The Companys borrowing costs are impacted by its    credit ratings developed by various rating agencies.     Three major ratings agencies (Moodys, Standard and    Poors, and Fitch Ratings) evaluate the Companys    credit profile on an ongoing basis and have each assigned high    ratings for the Companys long-term debt as of    December 31, 2009. In February 2010, the Company met    with Moodys, Standard Poors and Fitch Ratings. All    agencies reaffirmed their current credit ratings for the    Company. Although the Company does not anticipate a material    change in its credit ratings, if the Companys current    credit ratings deteriorate, then its borrowing costs could    increase, including increased fees under the Five-Year Credit    Facility and the Companys access to future sources of    liquidity may be adversely affected. "
15,DOV,DOVER CORP,2009-02-20,">Item 1A.  Risk    Factors     Dovers business, financial condition, operating results    and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors which    could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent    results or from anticipated future results. The risk factors    discussed in this section should be considered together with    information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on    Form 10-K    and should not be considered the only risks facing the Company.    The structure of Dover and the many different markets its    companies serve mitigate the possibility that any single risk    factor will materially impact Dovers consolidated    financial position.     In general, Dover is subject to the same general risks and    uncertainties that impact many other industrial companies such    as general economic, industry and/or market conditions and    growth rates; the impact of natural disasters, and their effect    on global energy markets; continued events in the Middle East    and possible future terrorist threats and their effect on the    worldwide economy; and changes in laws or accounting rules. The    Company has identified the following specific risks and    uncertainties that it considers material:  The    Companys results for 2009 will be impacted by current    domestic and international economic conditions and    uncertainties.     In 2009 Dovers businesses will be adversely affected by    disruptions in financial markets or declines in economic    activity both domestically and internationally in those    countries in which the Company operates. These circumstances    will also impact the Companys suppliers and customers in    various ways which could have an impact on the Companys    business operations, particularly if global credit markets are    not operating efficiently and effectively to support industrial    commerce. Such negative changes in worldwide economic and    capital market conditions are beyond the Companys control,    are highly unpredictable, and can have an adverse effect on the    Companys revenue, earnings, cash flows and cost of capital.    9Table of Contents Increasing    price and product/service competition by international and    domestic competitors including new entrants and the ability of    Dover to introduce new and competitive products could cause    Dovers businesses to generate lower revenue, operating    profits and cash flows.     Dovers competitive environment is complex because of the    wide diversity of the products that its companies manufacture    and the markets they serve. In general, most Dover companies are    market leaders that compete with only a few companies. The    ability of Dovers companies to compete effectively will    depend on how successfully they anticipate and respond to    various competitive factors, including new products and services    that may be introduced by their competitors, changes in customer    preferences, and pricing pressures. If Dovers companies    are unable to anticipate their competitors development of    new products and services    and/or    identify customer needs and preferences on a timely basis, they    could lose customers to competitors. If Dovers companies    do not compete effectively or if new products and services fail    to gain acceptance in the marketplace, Dover companies may    experience lower revenue, operating profits and cash flows.  Some    of Dovers companies, may not anticipate , adapt or    capitalize on technological developments and are subject to the    cyclical nature of their industries. These factors could cause    these companies to become less competitive and lead to reduced    market share, revenue, operating profits and cash    flows.     Certain Dover companies, particularly in the Electronic    Technologies segment, sell their products in industries that are    constantly experiencing change as new technologies are    developed.

In addition,    certain of Dovers businesses manufacture products that are    used in or related to residential and commercial construction,    which can be adversely affected by a prolonged downturn in new    housing starts and other construction markets.     As a result of all the above factors, the revenue and operating    performance of these companies in any one period are not    necessarily predictive of their revenue and operating    performance in other periods, and could have a material impact    on Dovers consolidated results of operations, financial    position and cash flows.  Our    companies could lose customers or generate lower revenue,    operating profits and cash flows if there are significant    increases in the cost of energy or raw materials or if they are    unable to obtain raw materials.     Dovers companies purchase raw materials, subassemblies and    components for use in their manufacturing operations, which    exposes them to volatility in prices for certain commodities.    Significant price increases for these commodities could    adversely affect operating profits for certain Dover companies.    While Dovers businesses generally attempt to mitigate the    impact of increased raw material prices by hedging or passing    along the increased costs to customers, there may be a time    delay between the increased raw material prices and the ability    to increase the prices of products, or they may be unable to    increase the prices of products due to a competitors    pricing pressure or other factors. In addition, while raw    materials are generally available now, the inability to obtain    necessary raw materials could affect the ability to meet    customer commitments and satisfy market demand for certain    products. Consequently, a significant price increase in raw    materials, or their unavailability, may result in a loss of    customers and adversely impact revenue, operating profits and    cash flows.  The    Companys growth strategy with respect to expansion into    new geographic markets could be adversely affected if    Dovers companies are unable to manage the associated    risks, particularly in markets outside the U.S.     Approximately 45% of Dovers revenue is derived outside of    the United States and the Company continues to focus on    penetrating new global markets as part of its overall growth    strategy. This global expansion strategy is subject to, but    10Table of Contents    not limited to, the following risks and uncertainties:    political, social and economic instability and disruptions;    government embargoes or trade restrictions; the imposition of    duties and tariffs and other trade barriers; import and export    controls; increased compliance costs; transportation delays and    disruptions; and difficulties in staffing and managing    multi-national organizations. In addition, foreign currency    fluctuations, particularly the appreciation of the U.S. Dollar    against European currencies, generally has an adverse affect on    exports and the related revenue and earnings. As a result, if    the Company is unable to successfully mitigate these risks, they    could have an adverse affect on the Companys growth    strategy as it relates to expanding into new geographic markets    and its results of operations and financial position.  The    Companys operating profits and cash flows could be    adversely affected if the Company cannot achieve projected    savings and synergies.     Dover is continually evaluating its cost structure and seeking    ways to capture synergies across its operations. If the Company    is unable to reduce costs and expenses through its various    programs, it could adversely affect the Companys operating    profits and cash flows.  The    Companys businesses and their profitability and reputation    could be adversely affected by domestic and foreign governmental    and public policy changes (including environmental regulations    and tax policies such as export subsidy programs, R&E    credits and other similar programs), risks associated with    emerging markets, changes in statutory tax rates and    unanticipated outcomes with respect to tax audits.     Dovers domestic and international sales and operations are    subject to risks associated with changes in local government    laws (including environmental and export laws), regulations and    policies. Failure to comply with any of these laws could result    in civil and criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties as    well as potential damage to the Companys reputation. In    addition, the Company cannot provide assurance that its costs of    complying with current or future laws, including environmental    protection and health and safety laws, will not exceed its    estimates. In addition, Dover has invested in certain countries,    including Brazil, Russia, India and China that carry high levels    of currency, political, compliance and economic risk. While    these risks or the impact of these risks are difficult to    predict, any one or more of them could adversely affect    Dovers businesses and reputation.     Dovers effective tax rate is impacted by changes in the    mix among earnings in countries with differing statutory tax    rates, changes in the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets    or tax laws. The amount of income taxes and other taxes paid can    be adversely impacted by changes in statutory tax rates and laws    and are subject to ongoing audits by domestic and international    authorities. If these audits result in assessments different    from amounts estimated, the Companys financial results may    be adversely affected by unfavorable tax adjustments.  Unforeseen    developments in contingencies such as litigation could adversely    affect the Companys financial condition.     The Company and certain of its subsidiaries are, and from time    to time may become, parties to a number of legal proceedings    incidental to their businesses involving alleged injuries    arising out of the use of their products, exposure to hazardous    substances or patent infringement, employment matters and    commercial disputes. The defense of these lawsuits may require    significant expenses, divert managements attention, and    the Company may be required to pay damages that could adversely    affect its financial condition. In addition, any insurance or    indemnification rights that the Company may have may be    insufficient or unavailable to protect it against potential loss    exposures.  The    Companys revenue, operating profits and cash flows could    be adversely affected if Dovers companies are unable to    protect or obtain patent and other intellectual property    rights.     Dover companies own patents, trademarks, licenses and other    forms of intellectual property related to their products. The    Company employs various measures to maintain and protect their    intellectual property. These measures may not prevent these    items from being challenged, invalidated or circumvented,    particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are    not highly developed or protected. Unauthorized use of these    intellectual    11Table of Contents    property rights could adversely impact the competitive position    of Dovers companies and have a negative impact on their    revenue, operating profits and cash flows.  The    Companys growth may be adversely affected if the Company    is unsuccessful in its acquisition program.     The Company expects to continue its strategy of seeking to    acquire value creating add-on businesses that broaden its    existing companies and their global reach as well as    strategically pursuing larger, stand-alone businesses that have    the potential to either complement our existing companies or    allow Dover to pursue a new platform. However, there can be no    assurance that the Company will find suitable businesses to    purchase, as a substantial number of the Companys current    businesses operate in relatively mature markets, or that the    associated price would be acceptable. If the Company is    unsuccessful in its acquisition efforts, its ability to continue    to grow at rates similar to prior years could be adversely    affected. In addition, a completed acquisition may underperform    relative to expectations, be unable to achieve synergies    originally anticipated, or require the payment of additional    expenses for assumed liabilities. These factors could    potentially have an adverse impact on Dovers operating    profits and cash flows.  The    Companys borrowing costs are impacted by its credit    ratings developed by various rating agencies.     Three major ratings agencies (Moodys, Standard and    Poors and Fitch) evaluate Dovers credit profile on    an ongoing basis and have each assigned high ratings for    Dovers long-term debt as of December 31, 2008 (A2, A,    and A, respectively). In January 2009, Fitch reaffirmed its    credit rating for Dover with a negative outlook, while the    ratings and outlooks from the other agencies remained unchanged.    Although the Company does not anticipate a material change in    its credit ratings, if the Companys current credit ratings    deteriorate, its borrowing costs and access to sources of    liquidity may be adversely affected.  2009    Outlook     Dover currently anticipates that 2009 revenue will decline    11%-13%, below 2008 levels and currently does not anticipate a    recovery in the latter half of 2009 from these demand levels.    Based on these assumptions, Dover has projected that its    continuing diluted earnings per share for 2009 will be in the    range of $2.75 to $3.05, and expects its earnings to follow a    traditional seasonal pattern of being lower in the first and    fourth quarters, and higher in the second and third quarters. If    global or domestic economic conditions deteriorate further,    Dovers operating results for 2009 could be materially    worse than projected. "
