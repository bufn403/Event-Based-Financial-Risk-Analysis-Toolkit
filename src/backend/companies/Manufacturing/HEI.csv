9,HEI,HEICO CORP,2023-12-20,"    RISK FACTORSOur business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows may be impacted by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including those set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, any one of which may cause our actual results to differ materially from anticipated results:Strategic, Business and Operational RisksWe may not be able to effectively execute our acquisition strategy, which could slow our growth.    A key element of our strategy is growth through the acquisition of additional companies.  Our acquisition strategy is affected by and poses a number of challenges and risks, including the following:•Availability of suitable acquisition candidates;•Availability of capital;•Diversion of management’s attention;•Effective integration of the operations and personnel of acquired companies;•Potential write-downs of acquired intangible assets;•Potential loss of key employees of acquired companies;•Use of a significant portion of our available cash;•Significant dilution to our shareholders for acquisitions made utilizing our securities; •Consummation of acquisitions on satisfactory terms; and•Obtaining applicable domestic and/or foreign governmental approvals such as antitrust and foreign investment related authorizations.    We may not be able to successfully execute our acquisition strategy, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our success is dependent on the development and manufacture of new products, equipment and services.  Our inability to develop, manufacture and introduce new products and services at profitable pricing levels could reduce our sales or sales growth.    The aviation, defense, space, medical, telecommunications and electronics industries are constantly undergoing development and change and, accordingly, new products, equipment and methods of repair and overhaul service are likely to be introduced in the future.  In addition to manufacturing electronic and electro-optical equipment and selected aerospace and defense components for OEMs and the U.S. government and repairing jet engine and aircraft components, we re-design sophisticated aircraft replacement parts originally developed by OEMs so that we can offer the replacement parts for sale at substantially lower prices than those manufactured by the OEMs.  Consequently, we devote substantial resources to research and 18Indexproduct development.  Technological development poses a number of challenges and risks, including the following:•We may not be able to successfully protect the proprietary interests we have in various aircraft parts, electronic and electro-optical equipment and our repair processes;•As OEMs continue to develop and improve jet engines and aircraft components, we may not be able to re-design and manufacture replacement parts that perform as well as those offered by OEMs or we may not be able to profitably sell our replacement parts at lower prices than the OEMs;•We may need to expend significant capital to:-    purchase new equipment and machines,-    train employees in new methods of production and service, and-    fund the research and development of new products; and •Development by our competitors of patents or methodologies that preclude us from the design and manufacture of aircraft replacement parts or electrical and electro-optical equipment could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.    In addition, we may not be able to successfully develop new products, equipment or methods of repair and overhaul service, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Intense competition from existing and new competitors may harm our business.     We face significant competition in each of our businesses. Flight Support Group •For jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts, we compete with the industry’s leading jet engine and aircraft component OEMs. •For the distribution, overhaul and repair of jet engine and aircraft components and avionics and navigation systems as well as the manufacture of specialty aircraft and defense related parts, we compete with:-    major commercial airlines, many of which operate their own maintenance and overhaul units;-     OEMs, which manufacture, distribute, repair and overhaul their own and other OEM parts; and -     other independent service companies.19IndexElectronic Technologies Group•For the design and manufacture of various types of electronic, data and microwave, and electro-optical equipment products, we compete in a fragmented marketplace with a number of companies, some of which are well capitalized.    Many of the industries serviced by our operating segments are highly fragmented, have several highly visible leading companies, and are characterized by intense competition.  Some of our OEM competitors have greater name recognition than HEICO, as well as complementary lines of business and financial, marketing and other resources that HEICO does not have.  In addition, OEMs, aircraft maintenance providers, leasing companies and FAA-certificated repair facilities may attempt to bundle their services and product offerings in the supply industry, thereby significantly increasing industry competition.  Moreover, our smaller competitors may be able to offer more attractive pricing of parts as a result of lower labor costs or other factors.  A variety of potential actions by any of our competitors, including a reduction of product prices or the establishment by competitors of long-term relationships with new or existing customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Competition typically intensifies during cyclical downturns in the aviation industry, when supply may exceed demand.  We may not be able to continue to compete effectively against present or future competitors, and competitive pressures may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The inability to obtain certain components and raw materials from suppliers could harm our business.    Our business is affected by the availability and price of the raw materials and component parts that we use to manufacture our products.  Our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers’ ability to adjust delivery of long-lead time products during times of volatile demand.  The supply chains for our business could also be disrupted by external events such as natural disasters, extreme weather events, pandemics, labor disputes, governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes.  As a result, our suppliers may fail to perform according to specifications when required and we may be unable to identify alternate suppliers or to otherwise mitigate the consequences of their non-performance.  Transitions to new suppliers may result in significant costs and delays, including those related to the required recertification of parts obtained from new suppliers with our customers and/or regulatory agencies.  Our inability to fill our supply needs could jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under customer contracts, which could result in reduced revenues and profits, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships.  Further, increased costs of such raw materials or components could reduce our profits if we were unable to pass along such price increases to our customers.20IndexProduct specification costs and requirements could cause an increase to our costs to complete contracts.    The costs to meet customer specifications and requirements could result in us having to spend more to design or manufacture products and this could reduce our profit margins on current contracts or those we obtain in the future.We may incur damages or disruption to our business caused by natural disasters and other factors that may not be covered by insurance.    Several of our facilities, as a result of their locations, could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, floods, fire, power loss, telecommunication and information systems failure, political unrest or similar events.  Our corporate headquarters and facilities located in Florida are particularly susceptible to hurricanes, storms, tornadoes or other natural disasters that could disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility or facilities.  Should insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms, such as our existing disaster recovery and business continuity plans, be insufficient to recover all costs, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to the risks associated with sales to foreign customers, which could harm our business.    We market our products and services to approximately 125 countries, with approximately 34% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2023 derived from sales to foreign customers.  We expect that sales to foreign customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future.  As a result, we are subject to risks of doing business internationally, including the following: •Fluctuations in currency exchange rates;•Geopolitical unrest, war, terrorism and other acts of violence; •Volatility in foreign political, regulatory, and economic environments;•Ability to obtain required export licenses or approvals;•Uncertainty of the ability of foreign customers to finance purchases;•Uncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of funding credit or guarantees;•Imposition of taxes, export controls, tariffs, embargoes and other trade restrictions; and•Compliance with a variety of international laws, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.    While the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.21IndexCyber security events or other disruptions of our information technology systems could adversely affect our business.    We rely on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities.  We also collect and store sensitive data, including confidential business information and personal data.  These systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events.  In addition, security breaches of our systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers.  Any such events could disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in defective products or services, damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal claims or proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may not have the administrative, operational or financial resources to continue to grow the company.    We have experienced rapid growth in recent periods and intend to continue to pursue an aggressive growth strategy, both through acquisitions and internal expansion of products and services.  Our growth to date has placed, and could continue to place, significant demands on our administrative, operational and financial resources.  We may not be able to grow effectively or manage our growth successfully, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Goodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant portion of our total assets, and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets.As a result of our acquisitions, goodwill and intangible assets represent a significant portion of our total assets.  As of October 31, 2023 and 2022, goodwill and intangible assets, net of amortization, accounted for 64% and 59% of our total assets, respectively.  We test our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable.  We may not realize the full value of our goodwill and intangible assets, and to the extent that impairment has occurred, we would be required to recognize the impaired portion of such assets in our earnings.  An impairment of a significant portion of such assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.22IndexWe are dependent on key personnel and the loss of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our success.    Our success substantially depends on the performance, contributions and expertise of our senior management team led by Laurans A. Mendelson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Eric A. Mendelson and Victor H. Mendelson, our Co-Presidents.  Technical employees are also critical to our research and product development, as well as our ability to continue to re-design sophisticated products of OEMs in order to sell competing replacement parts at substantially lower prices than those manufactured by the OEMs.  The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees or our inability to continue to attract or retain the necessary personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our executive officers and directors have significant influence over our management and direction.    As of December 18, 2023, collectively our executive officers and entities controlled by them, the HEICO Savings and Investment Plan (our 401(k) Plan) and members of the Board of Directors beneficially owned approximately 19% of our outstanding Common Stock and approximately 3% of our outstanding Class A Common Stock.  Accordingly, they will be able to substantially influence the election of the Board of Directors and control our business, policies and affairs, including our position with respect to proposed business combinations and attempted takeovers.Industry and Macroeconomic RisksOur success is highly dependent on the performance of the aviation industry, which could be impacted by lower demand for commercial air travel or airline fleet changes causing lower demand for our goods and services.     General global industry and economic conditions that affect the aviation industry also affect our business.  We are subject to macroeconomic cycles and when recessions occur, we may experience reduced orders, payment delays, supply chain disruptions or other factors as a result of the economic challenges faced by our customers, prospective customers and suppliers.  Further, the aviation industry has historically been subject to downward cycles from time to time which reduce the overall demand for jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts and repair and overhaul services, and such downward cycles result in lower sales and greater credit risk.  Demand for commercial air travel can be influenced by airline industry profitability, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, terrorism, disease outbreaks, environmental constraints imposed upon aircraft operations, technological changes, price and other competitive factors.  Lower commercial air travel caused by risks arising from public health threats, such as the the COVID-19 global pandemic and their aftermath, airline fleet changes or airline purchasing decisions, could cause lower demand for our goods and services.  These global industry and economic conditions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.23IndexThe retirement or prolonged grounding of commercial aircraft could reduce our revenues and the value of any related inventory.    Our Flight Support Group designs and manufactures jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts and also repairs, overhauls and distributes jet engine and aircraft components.  If aircraft or engines for which we offer replacement parts or supply repair and overhaul services are retired or grounded for prolonged periods of time and there are fewer aircraft that require these parts or services, our revenues may decline as well as the value of any related inventory.Reductions in defense, space or homeland security spending by U.S. and/or foreign customers could reduce our revenues.    In fiscal 2023, approximately 35% of our net sales were derived from the sale of defense, commercial and defense satellite and spacecraft components, and homeland security products.  A decline in defense, space or homeland security budgets or additional restrictions imposed by the U.S. government on sales of products or services to foreign military agencies could lower sales of our products and services.We are subject to risks arising from public health threats, such as the the COVID-19 global pandemic (""Health Emergencies""). Our results of operations may continue to reflect the adverse impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, including its impact on our supply chain and inflationary pressures.  Health Emergencies pose a risk that we or our employees, customers, suppliers, manufacturers and other commercial partners may be prevented from conducting business activities for an indefinite period of time, including due to the spread of the disease or shutdowns requested or mandated by governmental authorities.  The extent to which Health Emergencies may have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on many factors that are not within HEICO’s control, including but not limited to the path and effect of Health Emergencies, including factors like new variants and vaccination rates, potential supply chain disruptions and inflation, which can impact our key markets. Regulatory and Legal RisksWe are subject to governmental regulation and our failure to comply with these regulations could cause the government to withdraw, suspend or revoke our authorizations and approvals to do business and could subject us to penalties and sanctions that could harm our business.    Governmental agencies throughout the world, including the FAA, highly regulate the manufacture, repair and overhaul of aircraft parts and accessories.  We include, with the replacement parts that we sell to our customers, documentation certifying that each part complies with applicable regulatory requirements and meets applicable standards of airworthiness 24Indexestablished by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries.  In addition, our repair and overhaul operations are subject to certification pursuant to regulations established by the FAA.  Specific regulations vary from country to country, although compliance with FAA requirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in other countries.  The revocation or suspension of any of our material authorizations or approvals would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  New and more stringent government regulations, if adopted and enacted, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, certain product sales to foreign countries of our Electronic Technologies Group and Flight Support Group require export approval or licensing from the United States (""U.S."") government.  Denial of export licenses could reduce our sales to those countries and could have a material adverse effect on our business.    Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission promulgated disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals (tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten), known as conflict minerals, which are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or another Covered Country.  There are costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of certain minerals used in our products, as well as costs of possible changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities.  Given the complexity of our supply chain, we may not be able to ascertain the origin of these minerals used in our products in a timely manner, which could cause some of our customers to disqualify us as a supplier to the extent we are unable to certify our products are conflict mineral free.  Additionally, the rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of such minerals used in our manufacturing processes for certain products.Also, in foreign countries in which we have operations or business, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies and compliance programs, engage in business practices prohibited by U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (""FCPA""), or the laws and regulations of other countries, such as the United Kingdom Bribery Act.  Any such violations could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Tax changes could affect our effective tax rate and future profitability.    We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, multiple state jurisdictions and certain jurisdictions outside the U.S.  In fiscal 2023, our effective tax rate was 20.0%.  Our future effective tax rate may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including the following:•Changes in statutory tax rates in any of the various jurisdictions where we file tax returns; •Changes in available tax credits or tax deductions;•Changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws including interpretations, amendments and technical corrections of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act;•Changes to the accounting for income taxes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;25Index•The amount of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in our subsidiaries structured as partnerships;•Changes in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates;•Adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; •Resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities; and•The reversal of any previously experienced tax-exempt unrealized gains in the cash surrender values of life insurance policies related to the HEICO Corporation Leadership Compensation Plan, a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.        Any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could have a material adverse effect on net income for future periods.We may incur product liability claims that are not fully insured and such insurance may not be available at commercially reasonable rates.    Our jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts and repair and overhaul services expose our business to potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of an aircraft component that we have designed, manufactured or serviced.  While we maintain liability insurance to protect us from future product liability claims, an uninsured or partially insured claim, or a claim for which third-party indemnification is not available, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Additionally, our customers typically require us to maintain substantial insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates and our inability to obtain insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates could have a material adverse effect on our business.  We may incur environmental liabilities and these liabilities may not be covered by insurance.    Our operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, which govern, among other things, the discharge of hazardous materials into the air and water as well as the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials.  Pursuant to various environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous materials.  Environmental laws typically impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous materials in the environment.  Although management believes that our operations and facilities are in material compliance with environmental laws and regulations, future changes in them or interpretations thereof or the nature of our operations may require us to make significant additional capital expenditures to ensure compliance in the future.We carry limited specific environmental insurance, thus, losses could occur for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage.  The occurrence of an event that is not covered in full or in part by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.26Index"
14,HEI,HEICO CORP,2022-12-21,"    RISK FACTORSOur business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows may be impacted by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including those set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, any one of which may cause our actual results to differ materially from anticipated results:Strategic, Business and Operational RisksWe may not be able to effectively execute our acquisition strategy, which could slow our growth.    A key element of our strategy is growth through the acquisition of additional companies.  Our acquisition strategy is affected by and poses a number of challenges and risks, including the following:•Availability of suitable acquisition candidates;•Availability of capital;•Diversion of management’s attention;•Effective integration of the operations and personnel of acquired companies;•Potential write-downs of acquired intangible assets;•Potential loss of key employees of acquired companies;•Use of a significant portion of our available cash;•Significant dilution to our shareholders for acquisitions made utilizing our securities; •Consummation of acquisitions on satisfactory terms; and•Obtaining applicable domestic and/or foreign governmental approvals such as antitrust and foreign investment related authorizations.    We may not be able to successfully execute our acquisition strategy, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our success is dependent on the development and manufacture of new products, equipment and services.  Our inability to develop, manufacture and introduce new products and services at profitable pricing levels could reduce our sales or sales growth.    The aviation, defense, space, medical, telecommunications and electronics industries are constantly undergoing development and change and, accordingly, new products, equipment and methods of repair and overhaul service are likely to be introduced in the future.  In addition to manufacturing electronic and electro-optical equipment and selected aerospace and defense components for OEMs and the U.S. government and repairing jet engine and aircraft components, we re-design sophisticated aircraft replacement parts originally developed by OEMs so that we can offer the replacement parts for sale at substantially lower prices than those manufactured by the OEMs.  Consequently, we devote substantial resources to research and 18Indexproduct development.  Technological development poses a number of challenges and risks, including the following:•We may not be able to successfully protect the proprietary interests we have in various aircraft parts, electronic and electro-optical equipment and our repair processes;•As OEMs continue to develop and improve jet engines and aircraft components, we may not be able to re-design and manufacture replacement parts that perform as well as those offered by OEMs or we may not be able to profitably sell our replacement parts at lower prices than the OEMs;•We may need to expend significant capital to:-    purchase new equipment and machines,-    train employees in new methods of production and service, and-    fund the research and development of new products; and •Development by our competitors of patents or methodologies that preclude us from the design and manufacture of aircraft replacement parts or electrical and electro-optical equipment could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.    In addition, we may not be able to successfully develop new products, equipment or methods of repair and overhaul service, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Intense competition from existing and new competitors may harm our business.     We face significant competition in each of our businesses. Flight Support Group •For jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts, we compete with the industry’s leading jet engine and aircraft component OEMs. •For the distribution, overhaul and repair of jet engine and aircraft components and avionics and navigation systems as well as the manufacture of specialty aircraft and defense related parts, we compete with:-    major commercial airlines, many of which operate their own maintenance and overhaul units;-     OEMs, which manufacture, distribute, repair and overhaul their own and other OEM parts; and -     other independent service companies.19IndexElectronic Technologies Group•For the design and manufacture of various types of electronic, data and microwave, and electro-optical equipment products, we compete in a fragmented marketplace with a number of companies, some of which are well capitalized.    Many of the industries serviced by our operating segments are highly fragmented, have several highly visible leading companies, and are characterized by intense competition.  Some of our OEM competitors have greater name recognition than HEICO, as well as complementary lines of business and financial, marketing and other resources that HEICO does not have.  In addition, OEMs, aircraft maintenance providers, leasing companies and FAA-certificated repair facilities may attempt to bundle their services and product offerings in the supply industry, thereby significantly increasing industry competition.  Moreover, our smaller competitors may be able to offer more attractive pricing of parts as a result of lower labor costs or other factors.  A variety of potential actions by any of our competitors, including a reduction of product prices or the establishment by competitors of long-term relationships with new or existing customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Competition typically intensifies during cyclical downturns in the aviation industry, when supply may exceed demand.  We may not be able to continue to compete effectively against present or future competitors, and competitive pressures may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The inability to obtain certain components and raw materials from suppliers could harm our business.    Our business is affected by the availability and price of the raw materials and component parts that we use to manufacture our products.  Our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers’ ability to adjust delivery of long-lead time products during times of volatile demand.  The supply chains for our business could also be disrupted by external events such as natural disasters, extreme weather events, pandemics, labor disputes, governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes.  As a result, our suppliers may fail to perform according to specifications when required and we may be unable to identify alternate suppliers or to otherwise mitigate the consequences of their non-performance.  Transitions to new suppliers may result in significant costs and delays, including those related to the required recertification of parts obtained from new suppliers with our customers and/or regulatory agencies.  Our inability to fill our supply needs could jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under customer contracts, which could result in reduced revenues and profits, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships.  Further, increased costs of such raw materials or components could reduce our profits if we were unable to pass along such price increases to our customers.20IndexProduct specification costs and requirements could cause an increase to our costs to complete contracts.    The costs to meet customer specifications and requirements could result in us having to spend more to design or manufacture products and this could reduce our profit margins on current contracts or those we obtain in the future.We may incur damages or disruption to our business caused by natural disasters and other factors that may not be covered by insurance.    Several of our facilities, as a result of their locations, could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, floods, fire, power loss, telecommunication and information systems failure, political unrest or similar events.  Our corporate headquarters and facilities located in Florida are particularly susceptible to hurricanes, storms, tornadoes or other natural disasters that could disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility or facilities.  Should insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms, such as our existing disaster recovery and business continuity plans, be insufficient to recover all costs, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to the risks associated with sales to foreign customers, which could harm our business.    We market our products and services to approximately 125 countries, with approximately 35% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2022 derived from sales to foreign customers.  We expect that sales to foreign customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future.  As a result, we are subject to risks of doing business internationally, including the following: •Fluctuations in currency exchange rates;•Volatility in foreign political, regulatory, and economic environments;•Ability to obtain required export licenses or approvals;•Uncertainty of the ability of foreign customers to finance purchases;•Uncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of funding credit or guarantees;•Imposition of taxes, export controls, tariffs, embargoes and other trade restrictions; and•Compliance with a variety of international laws, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.    While the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.21IndexCyber security events or other disruptions of our information technology systems could adversely affect our business.    We rely on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities.  We also collect and store sensitive data, including confidential business information and personal data.  These systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events.  In addition, security breaches of our systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers.  Any such events could disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in defective products or services, damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal claims or proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may not have the administrative, operational or financial resources to continue to grow the company.    We have experienced rapid growth in recent periods and intend to continue to pursue an aggressive growth strategy, both through acquisitions and internal expansion of products and services.  Our growth to date has placed, and could continue to place, significant demands on our administrative, operational and financial resources.  We may not be able to grow effectively or manage our growth successfully, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Goodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant portion of our total assets, and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets.As a result of our acquisitions, goodwill and intangible assets represent a significant portion of our total assets.  As of October 31, 2022 and 2021, goodwill and intangible assets, net of amortization, accounted for 59% and 58% of our total assets, respectively.  We test our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable.  We may not realize the full value of our goodwill and intangible assets, and to the extent that impairment has occurred, we would be required to recognize the impaired portion of such assets in our earnings.  An impairment of a significant portion of such assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are dependent on key personnel and the loss of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our success.    Our success substantially depends on the performance, contributions and expertise of our senior management team led by Laurans A. Mendelson, our Chairman and Chief Executive 22IndexOfficer, and Eric A. Mendelson and Victor H. Mendelson, our Co-Presidents.  Technical employees are also critical to our research and product development, as well as our ability to continue to re-design sophisticated products of OEMs in order to sell competing replacement parts at substantially lower prices than those manufactured by the OEMs.  The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees or our inability to continue to attract or retain the necessary personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our executive officers and directors have significant influence over our management and direction.    As of December 20, 2022, collectively our executive officers and entities controlled by them, the HEICO Savings and Investment Plan (our 401(k) Plan) and members of the Board of Directors beneficially owned approximately 19% of our outstanding Common Stock and approximately 3% of our outstanding Class A Common Stock.  Accordingly, they will be able to substantially influence the election of the Board of Directors and control our business, policies and affairs, including our position with respect to proposed business combinations and attempted takeovers.Industry and Macroeconomic RisksOur success is highly dependent on the performance of the aviation industry, which could be impacted by lower demand for commercial air travel or airline fleet changes causing lower demand for our goods and services.     General global industry and economic conditions that affect the aviation industry also affect our business.  We are subject to macroeconomic cycles and when recessions occur, we may experience reduced orders, payment delays, supply chain disruptions or other factors as a result of the economic challenges faced by our customers, prospective customers and suppliers.  Further, the aviation industry has historically been subject to downward cycles from time to time which reduce the overall demand for jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts and repair and overhaul services, and such downward cycles result in lower sales and greater credit risk.  Demand for commercial air travel can be influenced by airline industry profitability, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, terrorism, disease outbreaks, environmental constraints imposed upon aircraft operations, technological changes, price and other competitive factors.  These global industry and economic conditions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The retirement or prolonged grounding of commercial aircraft could reduce our revenues and the value of any related inventory.    Our Flight Support Group designs and manufactures jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts and also repairs, overhauls and distributes jet engine and aircraft components.  If aircraft or engines for which we offer replacement parts or supply repair and overhaul services 23Indexare retired or grounded for prolonged periods of time and there are fewer aircraft that require these parts or services, our revenues may decline as well as the value of any related inventory.Reductions in defense, space or homeland security spending by U.S. and/or foreign customers could reduce our revenues.    In fiscal 2022, approximately 56% of the net sales of our Electronic Technologies Group were derived from the sale of defense, commercial and defense satellite and spacecraft components, and homeland security products.  A decline in defense, space or homeland security budgets or additional restrictions imposed by the U.S. government on sales of products or services to foreign military agencies could lower sales of our products and services.We are subject to risks arising from the COVID-19 global pandemic (the ""Pandemic""). Our results of operations may continue to reflect the adverse impact from the Pandemic, including its impact on our supply chain and inflationary pressures.  A pandemic or other public health epidemic, poses the risk that we or our employees, customers, suppliers, manufacturers and other commercial partners may be prevented from conducting business activities for an indefinite period of time, including due to the spread of the disease or shutdowns requested or mandated by governmental authorities.  The extent to which the Pandemic may have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on many factors that are not within HEICO’s control, including but not limited to the Pandemic's path and effect, including factors like new variants and vaccination rates, potential supply chain disruptions and inflation, which can impact our key markets. Regulatory and Legal RisksWe are subject to governmental regulation and our failure to comply with these regulations could cause the government to withdraw, suspend or revoke our authorizations and approvals to do business and could subject us to penalties and sanctions that could harm our business.    Governmental agencies throughout the world, including the FAA, highly regulate the manufacture, repair and overhaul of aircraft parts and accessories.  We include, with the replacement parts that we sell to our customers, documentation certifying that each part complies with applicable regulatory requirements and meets applicable standards of airworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries.  In addition, our repair and overhaul operations are subject to certification pursuant to regulations established by the FAA.  Specific regulations vary from country to country, although compliance with FAA requirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in other countries.  The revocation or suspension of any of our material authorizations or approvals would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  New and more stringent government regulations, if adopted and enacted, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial 24Indexcondition and results of operations.  In addition, certain product sales to foreign countries of our Electronic Technologies Group and Flight Support Group require export approval or licensing from the United States (""U.S."") government.  Denial of export licenses could reduce our sales to those countries and could have a material adverse effect on our business.    Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission promulgated disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals (tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten), known as conflict minerals, which are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or another Covered Country.  There are costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of certain minerals used in our products, as well as costs of possible changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities.  Given the complexity of our supply chain, we may not be able to ascertain the origin of these minerals used in our products in a timely manner, which could cause some of our customers to disqualify us as a supplier to the extent we are unable to certify our products are conflict mineral free.  Additionally, the rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of such minerals used in our manufacturing processes for certain products.Also, in foreign countries in which we have operations or business, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies and compliance programs, engage in business practices prohibited by U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (""FCPA""), or the laws and regulations of other countries, such as the United Kingdom Bribery Act.  Any such violations could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Tax changes could affect our effective tax rate and future profitability.    We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, multiple state jurisdictions and certain jurisdictions outside the U.S.  In fiscal 2022, our effective tax rate was 20.4%.  Our future effective tax rate may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including the following:•Changes in statutory tax rates in any of the various jurisdictions where we file tax returns; •Changes in available tax credits or tax deductions;•Changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws including interpretations, amendments and technical corrections of the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act;•Changes to the accounting for income taxes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;•The amount of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in our subsidiaries structured as partnerships;•Changes in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates;•Adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; •Resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities; and•The reversal of any previously experienced tax-exempt unrealized gains in the cash surrender values of life insurance policies related to the HEICO Corporation Leadership Compensation Plan, a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.        25IndexAny significant increase in our future effective tax rates could have a material adverse effect on net income for future periods.We may incur product liability claims that are not fully insured and such insurance may not be available at commercially reasonable rates.    Our jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts and repair and overhaul services expose our business to potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of an aircraft component that we have designed, manufactured or serviced.  While we maintain liability insurance to protect us from future product liability claims, an uninsured or partially insured claim, or a claim for which third-party indemnification is not available, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Additionally, our customers typically require us to maintain substantial insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates and our inability to obtain insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates could have a material adverse effect on our business.  We may incur environmental liabilities and these liabilities may not be covered by insurance.    Our operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, which govern, among other things, the discharge of hazardous materials into the air and water as well as the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials.  Pursuant to various environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous materials.  Environmental laws typically impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous materials in the environment.  Although management believes that our operations and facilities are in material compliance with environmental laws and regulations, future changes in them or interpretations thereof or the nature of our operations may require us to make significant additional capital expenditures to ensure compliance in the future.We carry limited specific environmental insurance, thus, losses could occur for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage.  The occurrence of an event that is not covered in full or in part by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations"
5,HEI,HEICO CORP,2021-12-21,"    RISK FACTORSOur business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows may be impacted by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including those set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, any one of which may cause our actual results to differ materially from anticipated results:Strategic, Business and Operational RisksWe may not be able to effectively execute our acquisition strategy, which could slow our growth.    A key element of our strategy is growth through the acquisition of additional companies.  Our acquisition strategy is affected by and poses a number of challenges and risks, including the following:•Availability of suitable acquisition candidates;•Availability of capital;•Diversion of management’s attention;•Effective integration of the operations and personnel of acquired companies;•Potential write-downs of acquired intangible assets;•Potential loss of key employees of acquired companies;•Use of a significant portion of our available cash;•Significant dilution to our shareholders for acquisitions made utilizing our securities; and•Consummation of acquisitions on satisfactory terms.    17IndexWe may not be able to successfully execute our acquisition strategy, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our success is dependent on the development and manufacture of new products, equipment and services.  Our inability to develop, manufacture and introduce new products and services at profitable pricing levels could reduce our sales or sales growth.    The aviation, defense, space, medical, telecommunications and electronics industries are constantly undergoing development and change and, accordingly, new products, equipment and methods of repair and overhaul service are likely to be introduced in the future.  In addition to manufacturing electronic and electro-optical equipment and selected aerospace and defense components for OEMs and the U.S. government and repairing jet engine and aircraft components, we re-design sophisticated aircraft replacement parts originally developed by OEMs so that we can offer the replacement parts for sale at substantially lower prices than those manufactured by the OEMs.  Consequently, we devote substantial resources to research and product development.  Technological development poses a number of challenges and risks, including the following:•We may not be able to successfully protect the proprietary interests we have in various aircraft parts, electronic and electro-optical equipment and our repair processes;•As OEMs continue to develop and improve jet engines and aircraft components, we may not be able to re-design and manufacture replacement parts that perform as well as those offered by OEMs or we may not be able to profitably sell our replacement parts at lower prices than the OEMs;•We may need to expend significant capital to:-    purchase new equipment and machines,-    train employees in new methods of production and service, and-    fund the research and development of new products; and •Development by our competitors of patents or methodologies that preclude us from the design and manufacture of aircraft replacement parts or electrical and electro-optical equipment could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.    In addition, we may not be able to successfully develop new products, equipment or methods of repair and overhaul service, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.18IndexIntense competition from existing and new competitors may harm our business.     We face significant competition in each of our businesses. Flight Support Group •For jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts, we compete with the industry’s leading jet engine and aircraft component OEMs. •For the distribution, overhaul and repair of jet engine and aircraft components and avionics and navigation systems as well as the manufacture of specialty aircraft and defense related parts, we compete with:-    major commercial airlines, many of which operate their own maintenance and overhaul units;-     OEMs, which manufacture, distribute, repair and overhaul their own and other OEM parts; and -     other independent service companies.Electronic Technologies Group•For the design and manufacture of various types of electronic, data and microwave, and electro-optical equipment products, we compete in a fragmented marketplace with a number of companies, some of which are well capitalized.    Many of the industries serviced by our operating segments are highly fragmented, have several highly visible leading companies, and are characterized by intense competition.  Some of our OEM competitors have greater name recognition than HEICO, as well as complementary lines of business and financial, marketing and other resources that HEICO does not have.  In addition, OEMs, aircraft maintenance providers, leasing companies and FAA-certificated repair facilities may attempt to bundle their services and product offerings in the supply industry, thereby significantly increasing industry competition.  Moreover, our smaller competitors may be able to offer more attractive pricing of parts as a result of lower labor costs or other factors.  A variety of potential actions by any of our competitors, including a reduction of product prices or the establishment by competitors of long-term relationships with new or existing customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Competition typically intensifies during cyclical downturns in the aviation industry, when supply may exceed demand.  We may not be able to continue to compete effectively against present or future competitors, and competitive pressures may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The inability to obtain certain components and raw materials from suppliers could harm our business.    Our business is affected by the availability and price of the raw materials and component parts that we use to manufacture our products.  Our ability to manage inventory and meet 19Indexdelivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers’ ability to adjust delivery of long-lead time products during times of volatile demand.  The supply chains for our business could also be disrupted by external events such as natural disasters, extreme weather events, pandemics, labor disputes, governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes.  As a result, our suppliers may fail to perform according to specifications when required and we may be unable to identify alternate suppliers or to otherwise mitigate the consequences of their non-performance.  Transitions to new suppliers may result in significant costs and delays, including those related to the required recertification of parts obtained from new suppliers with our customers and/or regulatory agencies.  Our inability to fill our supply needs could jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under customer contracts, which could result in reduced revenues and profits, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships.  Further, increased costs of such raw materials or components could reduce our profits if we were unable to pass along such price increases to our customers.Product specification costs and requirements could cause an increase to our costs to complete contracts.    The costs to meet customer specifications and requirements could result in us having to spend more to design or manufacture products and this could reduce our profit margins on current contracts or those we obtain in the future.We may incur damages or disruption to our business caused by natural disasters and other factors that may not be covered by insurance.    Several of our facilities, as a result of their locations, could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, floods, fire, power loss, telecommunication and information systems failure, political unrest or similar events.  Our corporate headquarters and facilities located in Florida are particularly susceptible to hurricanes, storms, tornadoes or other natural disasters that could disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility or facilities.  Should insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms, such as our existing disaster recovery and business continuity plans, be insufficient to recover all costs, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to the risks associated with sales to foreign customers, which could harm our business.    We market our products and services to approximately 115 countries, with approximately 36% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2021 derived from sales to foreign customers.  We expect that sales to foreign customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future.  As a result, we are subject to risks of doing business internationally, including the following: •Fluctuations in currency exchange rates;•Volatility in foreign political, regulatory, and economic environments;20Index•Ability to obtain required export licenses or approvals;•Uncertainty of the ability of foreign customers to finance purchases;•Uncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of funding credit or guarantees;•Imposition of taxes, export controls, tariffs, embargoes and other trade restrictions; and•Compliance with a variety of international laws, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.    While the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Cyber security events or other disruptions of our information technology systems could adversely affect our business.    We rely on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities.  We also collect and store sensitive data, including confidential business information and personal data.  These systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events.  In addition, security breaches of our systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers.  Any such events could disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in defective products or services, damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal claims or proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may not have the administrative, operational or financial resources to continue to grow the company.    We have experienced rapid growth in recent periods and intend to continue to pursue an aggressive growth strategy, both through acquisitions and internal expansion of products and services.  Our growth to date has placed, and could continue to place, significant demands on our administrative, operational and financial resources.  We may not be able to grow effectively or manage our growth successfully, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Goodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant portion of our total assets, and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets.As a result of our acquisitions, goodwill and intangible assets represent a significant portion of our total assets.  As of October 31, 2021 and 2020, goodwill and intangible assets, net of amortization, accounted for 58% and 55% of our total assets, respectively.  We test our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully 21Indexrecoverable.  We may not realize the full value of our goodwill and intangible assets, and to the extent that impairment has occurred, we would be required to recognize the impaired portion of such assets in our earnings.  An impairment of a significant portion of such assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are dependent on key personnel and the loss of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our success.    Our success substantially depends on the performance, contributions and expertise of our senior management team led by Laurans A. Mendelson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Eric A. Mendelson and Victor H. Mendelson, our Co-Presidents.  Technical employees are also critical to our research and product development, as well as our ability to continue to re-design sophisticated products of OEMs in order to sell competing replacement parts at substantially lower prices than those manufactured by the OEMs.  The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees or our inability to continue to attract or retain the necessary personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our executive officers and directors have significant influence over our management and direction.    As of December 20, 2021, collectively our executive officers and entities controlled by them, the HEICO Savings and Investment Plan (our 401(k) Plan) and members of the Board of Directors beneficially owned approximately 19% of our outstanding Common Stock and approximately 4% of our outstanding Class A Common Stock.  Accordingly, they will be able to substantially influence the election of the Board of Directors and control our business, policies and affairs, including our position with respect to proposed business combinations and attempted takeovers.Industry and Macroeconomic RisksOur success is highly dependent on the performance of the aviation industry, which could be impacted by lower demand for commercial air travel or airline fleet changes causing lower demand for our goods and services.     General global industry and economic conditions that affect the aviation industry also affect our business.  We are subject to macroeconomic cycles and when recessions occur, we may experience reduced orders, payment delays, supply chain disruptions or other factors as a result of the economic challenges faced by our customers, prospective customers and suppliers.  Further, the aviation industry has historically been subject to downward cycles from time to time which reduce the overall demand for jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts and repair and overhaul services, and such downward cycles result in lower sales and greater credit risk.  Demand for commercial air travel can be influenced by airline industry profitability, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, terrorism, disease outbreaks, environmental constraints imposed upon aircraft operations, technological changes, price and other competitive 22Indexfactors.  These global industry and economic conditions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The retirement or prolonged grounding of commercial aircraft could reduce our revenues and the value of any related inventory.    Our Flight Support Group designs and manufactures jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts and also repairs, overhauls and distributes jet engine and aircraft components.  If aircraft or engines for which we offer replacement parts or supply repair and overhaul services are retired or grounded for prolonged periods of time and there are fewer aircraft that require these parts or services, our revenues may decline as well as the value of any related inventory.Reductions in defense, space or homeland security spending by U.S. and/or foreign customers could reduce our revenues.    In fiscal 2021, approximately 63% of the net sales of our Electronic Technologies Group were derived from the sale of defense, commercial and defense satellite and spacecraft components, and homeland security products.  A decline in defense, space or homeland security budgets or additional restrictions imposed by the U.S. government on sales of products or services to foreign military agencies could lower sales of our products and services.We are subject to risks arising from the COVID-19 global pandemic (the ""Pandemic""). Our results of operations in fiscal 2021 were adversely impacted by the Pandemic.  A pandemic or other public health epidemic, poses the risk that we or our employees, customers, suppliers, manufacturers and other commercial partners may be prevented from conducting business activities for an indefinite period of time, including due to the spread of the disease or shutdowns requested or mandated by governmental authorities.  With respect to our results of operations, approximately 61% of our net sales in fiscal 2021 were derived from defense, space and other industrial markets including electronics, medical and telecommunications.  The remaining portion of our net sales is derived from commercial aviation products and services.  Most notably, this portion of our business continues to be moderated by the ongoing depressed commercial aerospace market as compared to pre-Pandemic levels.  Additionally, recent cost inflation and potential supply chain disruptions stemming from the Pandemic may lead to higher material costs in fiscal 2022.The extent to which the Pandemic may have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on many factors that are not within HEICO’s control, including but not limited to the duration, spread and severity of the Pandemic, government responses and other actions to mitigate the spread of and to treat the Pandemic, and when and to what extent normal business, economic and social activity and conditions resume.    23IndexRegulatory and Legal RisksWe are subject to governmental regulation and our failure to comply with these regulations could cause the government to withdraw, suspend or revoke our authorizations and approvals to do business and could subject us to penalties and sanctions that could harm our business.    Governmental agencies throughout the world, including the FAA, highly regulate the manufacture, repair and overhaul of aircraft parts and accessories.  We include, with the replacement parts that we sell to our customers, documentation certifying that each part complies with applicable regulatory requirements and meets applicable standards of airworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries.  In addition, our repair and overhaul operations are subject to certification pursuant to regulations established by the FAA.  Specific regulations vary from country to country, although compliance with FAA requirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in other countries.  The revocation or suspension of any of our material authorizations or approvals would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  New and more stringent government regulations, if adopted and enacted, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, certain product sales to foreign countries of our Electronic Technologies Group and Flight Support Group require export approval or licensing from the United States (""U.S."") government.  Denial of export licenses could reduce our sales to those countries and could have a material adverse effect on our business.    Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission promulgated disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals (tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten), known as conflict minerals, which are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or another Covered Country.  There are costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of certain minerals used in our products, as well as costs of possible changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities.  Given the complexity of our supply chain, we may not be able to ascertain the origin of these minerals used in our products in a timely manner, which could cause some of our customers to disqualify us as a supplier to the extent we are unable to certify our products are conflict mineral free.  Additionally, the rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of such minerals used in our manufacturing processes for certain products.Also, in foreign countries in which we have operations or business, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies and compliance programs, engage in business practices prohibited by U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (""FCPA""), or the laws and regulations of other countries, such as the United Kingdom Bribery Act.  Any such violations could have a material adverse effect on our business.  24IndexTax changes could affect our effective tax rate and future profitability.    We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, multiple state jurisdictions and certain jurisdictions outside the U.S.  In fiscal 2021, our effective tax rate was 14.8%.  Our future effective tax rate may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including the following:•Changes in statutory tax rates in any of the various jurisdictions where we file tax returns; •Changes in available tax credits or tax deductions;•Changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws including interpretations, amendments and technical corrections of the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act;•Changes to the accounting for income taxes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;•The amount of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in our subsidiaries structured as partnerships;•Changes in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates;•Adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; •Resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities; and•The reversal of any previously experienced tax-exempt unrealized gains in the cash surrender values of life insurance policies related to the HEICO Corporation Leadership Compensation Plan, a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.        Any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could have a material adverse effect on net income for future periods.We may incur product liability claims that are not fully insured and such insurance may not be available at commercially reasonable rates.    Our jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts and repair and overhaul services expose our business to potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of an aircraft component that we have designed, manufactured or serviced.  While we maintain liability insurance to protect us from future product liability claims, an uninsured or partially insured claim, or a claim for which third-party indemnification is not available, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Additionally, our customers typically require us to maintain substantial insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates and our inability to obtain insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates could have a material adverse effect on our business.  We may incur environmental liabilities and these liabilities may not be covered by insurance.    Our operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, which govern, among other things, the discharge of hazardous materials into the air and water as well as the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials.  Pursuant to various environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous 25Indexmaterials.  Environmental laws typically impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous materials in the environment.  Although management believes that our operations and facilities are in material compliance with environmental laws and regulations, future changes in them or interpretations thereof or the nature of our operations may require us to make significant additional capital expenditures to ensure compliance in the future.We carry limited specific environmental insurance, thus, losses could occur for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage.  The occurrence of an event that is not covered in full or in part by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations"

units;-     OEMs, which manufacture, distribute, repair and overhaul their own and other OEM parts; and -     other independent service companies.18IndexElectronic Technologies Group•For the design and manufacture of various types of electronic, data and microwave, and electro-optical equipment products, we compete in a fragmented marketplace with a number of companies, some of which are well capitalized.    The aviation aftermarket supply industry is highly fragmented, has several highly visible leading companies, and is characterized by intense competition.  Some of our OEM competitors have greater name recognition than HEICO, as well as complementary lines of business and financial, marketing and other resources that HEICO does not have.  In addition, OEMs, aircraft maintenance providers, leasing companies and FAA-certificated repair facilities may attempt to bundle their services and product offerings in the supply industry, thereby significantly increasing industry competition.  Moreover, our smaller competitors may be able to offer more attractive pricing of parts as a result of lower labor costs or other factors.  A variety of potential actions by any of our competitors, including a reduction of product prices or the establishment by competitors of long-term relationships with new or existing customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Competition typically intensifies during cyclical downturns in the aviation industry, when supply may exceed demand.  We may not be able to

disaster recovery and business continuity plans, be insufficient to recover all costs, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to the risks associated with sales to foreign customers, which could harm our business.    We market our products and services to approximately 110 countries, with approximately 33% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2020 derived from sales to foreign customers.  We expect that sales to foreign customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future.  As a result, we are subject to risks of doing business internationally, including the following:•Fluctuations in currency exchange rates;•Volatility in foreign political, regulatory, and economic environments;•Ability to obtain required export licenses or approvals;•Uncertainty of the ability of foreign customers to finance purchases;•Uncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of funding credit or guarantees;•Imposition of taxes, export controls, tariffs, embargoes and other trade restrictions; and•Compliance with a variety of international laws, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.    While the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Cyber security events or other disruptions of our information technology systems could adversely affect our business.    We rely on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities.  We also collect and store sensitive data, including confidential business information and personal data.  These systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, 20Indexemployee error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events.  In addition, security breaches of our systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers.  Any such events could disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in defective products or services, damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal claims or proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may not have the administrative, operational or financial resources to continue to grow the company.    We have experienced rapid growth in recent periods and intend to continue to pursue an aggressive growth strategy, both through acquisitions and internal expansion of products and services.  Our growth to date has placed, and could continue to place, significant demands on our administrative, operational and financial resources.  We may not be able to grow effectively or manage our growth successfully, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Goodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant portion of our total assets, and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets.As a result of our acquisitions, goodwill and intangible assets represent a significant portion of our total assets.  As of October 31, 2020 and 2019, goodwill and intangible assets, net of amortization, accounted for 55% and 61% of our total assets, respectively.  We test our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable.  We may not realize the full value of our goodwill and intangible assets, and to the extent that impairment has occurred, we would be required to recognize the impaired portion of such assets in our earnings.  An impairment of a significant portion of such assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are dependent on key personnel and the loss of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our success.    Our success substantially depends on the performance, contributions and expertise of our senior management team led by Laurans A. Mendelson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Eric A. Mendelson and Victor H. Mendelson, our Co-Presidents.  Technical employees are also critical to our research and product development, as well as our ability to continue to re-design sophisticated products of OEMs in order to sell competing replacement parts at substantially lower prices than those manufactured by the OEMs.  The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees or our inability to continue to attract or retain the necessary personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.21IndexOur executive officers and directors have significant influence over our management and direction.    As of December 22, 2020, collectively our executive officers and entities controlled by them, the HEICO Savings and Investment Plan (our 401(k) Plan) and members of the Board of Directors beneficially owned approximately 19% of our outstanding Common Stock and approximately 4% of our outstanding Class A Common Stock.  Accordingly, they will be able to substantially influence the election of the Board of Directors and control our business, policies and affairs, including our position with respect to proposed business combinations and attempted takeovers.Industry and Macroeconomic RisksOur success is highly dependent on the performance of the aviation industry, which could be impacted by lower demand for commercial air travel or airline fleet changes causing lower demand for our goods and services.     General global industry and economic conditions that affect the aviation industry also affect our business.  We are subject to macroeconomic cycles and when recessions occur, we may experience reduced orders, payment delays, supply chain disruptions or other factors as a result of the economic challenges faced by our customers, prospective customers and suppliers.  Further, the aviation industry has historically been subject to downward cycles from time to time which reduce the overall demand for jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts and repair and overhaul services, and such downward cycles result in lower sales and greater credit risk.  Demand for commercial air travel can be influenced by airline industry profitability, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, terrorism, disease outbreaks, environmental constraints imposed upon aircraft operations, technological changes, price and other competitive factors.  These global industry and economic conditions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The retirement or prolonged grounding of commercial aircraft could reduce our revenues.    Our Flight Support Group designs and manufactures jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts and also repairs, overhauls and distributes jet engine and aircraft components.  If aircraft or engines for which we offer replacement parts or supply repair and overhaul services are retired or grounded for prolonged periods of time and there are fewer aircraft that require these parts or services, our revenues may decline.Reductions in defense, space or homeland security spending by U.S. and/or foreign customers could reduce our revenues.    In fiscal 2020, approximately 66% of the net sales of our Electronic Technologies Group were derived from the sale of defense, commercial and defense satellite and spacecraft components, and homeland security products.  A decline in defense, space or homeland security 22Indexbudgets or additional restrictions imposed by the U.S. government on sales of products or services to foreign military agencies could lower sales of our products and services.We are subject to risks arising from the COVID-19 global pandemic (the ""Pandemic""). Our results of operations in fiscal 2020 were significantly affected by the Pandemic.  A pandemic or other public health epidemic, poses the risk that we or our employees, customers, suppliers, manufacturers and other commercial partners may be prevented from conducting business activities for an indefinite period of time, including due to the spread of the disease or shutdowns requested or mandated by governmental authorities.With respect to our results of operations, approximately 59% of our net sales in fiscal 2020 were derived from defense, space and other industrial markets including electronics, medical and telecommunications. Although demand for these products was slightly moderated in fiscal 2020, our overall results from this portion of our business were not materially impacted by the Pandemic.  However, we experienced, and expect to continue experiencing, periodic operational disruptions resulting from supply chain disturbances, staffing challenges - including at some of our customers, temporary facility closures, transportation interruptions and other conditions which slow production and orders, or increase costs.  The remaining portion of our net sales is derived from commercial aviation products and services.  Actions by U.S. federal, state and foreign governments to address the Pandemic, including lockdowns, quarantines, border controls, travel restrictions and business venue closures, as well as changes in the propensity for the general public to travel by air, have had and are expected to continue to have, a significant adverse effect on the commercial aircraft markets and the demand for certain products and services HEICO provides.  Furthermore, payment deferrals or defaults or bankruptcy of our customers has and may continue to adversely affect our business, and may lead to additional charges, impairments and other adverse financial impacts.The extent to which the Pandemic may have a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on many factors that are not within HEICO’s control, including but not limited to the duration, spread and severity of the Pandemic, government responses and other actions to mitigate the spread of and to treat the Pandemic, and when and to what extent normal business, economic and social activity and conditions resume.    Regulatory and Legal RisksWe are subject to governmental regulation and our failure to comply with these regulations could cause the government to withdraw or revoke our authorizations and approvals to do business and could subject us to penalties and sanctions that could harm our business.    Governmental agencies throughout the world, including the FAA, highly regulate the manufacture, repair and overhaul of aircraft parts and accessories.  We include, with the replacement parts that we sell to our customers, documentation certifying that each part complies 23Indexwith applicable regulatory requirements and meets applicable standards of airworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries.  In addition, our repair and overhaul operations are subject to certification pursuant to regulations established by the FAA.  Specific regulations vary from country to country, although compliance with FAA requirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in other countries.  The revocation or suspension of any of our material authorizations or approvals would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  New and more stringent government regulations, if adopted and enacted, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, certain product sales to foreign countries of our Electronic Technologies Group and Flight Support Group require approval or licensing from the United States (""U.S."") government.  Denial of export licenses could reduce our sales to those countries and could have a material adverse effect on our business.    Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission promulgated disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals (tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten), known as conflict minerals, which are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or one of its adjoining countries.  There are costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of certain minerals used in our products, as well as costs of possible changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities.  Given the complexity of our supply chain, we may not be able to ascertain the origin of these minerals used in our products in a timely manner, which could cause some of our customers to disqualify us as a supplier to the extent we are unable to certify our products are conflict mineral free.  Additionally, the rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of such minerals used in our manufacturing processes for certain products. Tax changes could affect our effective tax rate and future profitability.    We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, multiple state jurisdictions and certain jurisdictions outside the U.S.  In fiscal 2020, our effective tax rate was 7.9%.  Our future effective tax rate may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including the following:•Changes in statutory tax rates in any of the various jurisdictions where we file tax returns; •Changes in available tax credits or tax deductions;•Changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws including interpretations, amendments and technical corrections of the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act;•Changes to the accounting for income taxes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;•The amount of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in our subsidiaries structured as partnerships;•Changes in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates;•Adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; •Resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities; and24Index•The reversal of any previously experienced tax-exempt unrealized gains in the cash surrender values of life insurance policies related to the HEICO Corporation Leadership Compensation Plan, a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.        Any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could have a material adverse effect on net income for future periods.We may incur product liability claims that are not fully insured and such insurance may not be available at commercially reasonable rates.    Our jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts and repair and overhaul services expose our business to potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of an aircraft component that we have designed, manufactured or serviced.  While we maintain liability insurance to protect us from future product liability claims, an uninsured or partially insured claim, or a claim for which third-party indemnification is not available, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Additionally, our customers typically require us to maintain substantial insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates and our inability to obtain insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates could have a material adverse effect on our business.  We may incur environmental liabilities and these liabilities may not be covered by insurance.    Our operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, which govern, among other things, the discharge of hazardous materials into the air and water as well as the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials.  Pursuant to various environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous materials.  Environmental laws typically impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous materials.  Although management believes that our operations and facilities are in material compliance with environmental laws and regulations, future changes in them or interpretations thereof or the nature of our operations may require us to make significant additional capital expenditures to ensure compliance in the future.We carry limited specific environmental insurance, thus, losses could occur for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage.  The occurrence of an event that is not covered in full or in part by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations"
10,HEI,HEICO CORP,2019-12-19,"    RISK FACTORSOur business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows may be impacted by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including those set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, any one of which may cause our actual results to differ materially from anticipated results:Our success is highly dependent on the performance of the aviation industry, which could be impacted by lower demand for commercial air travel or airline fleet changes causing lower demand for our goods and services.     General global industry and economic conditions that affect the aviation industry also affect our business.  We are subject to macroeconomic cycles and when recessions occur, we may experience reduced orders, payment delays, supply chain disruptions or other factors as a result of the economic challenges faced by our customers, prospective customers and suppliers.  Further, the aviation industry has historically been subject to downward cycles from time to time which reduce the overall demand for jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts and repair and overhaul services, and such downward cycles result in lower sales and greater credit risk.  Demand for commercial air travel can be influenced by airline industry profitability, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, terrorism, disease outbreaks, environmental constraints imposed upon aircraft operations, technological changes, price and other competitive factors.  These global industry and economic conditions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to governmental regulation and our failure to comply with these regulations could cause the government to withdraw or revoke our authorizations and approvals to do business and could subject us to penalties and sanctions that could harm our business.Governmental agencies throughout the world, including the FAA, highly regulate the manufacture, repair and overhaul of aircraft parts and accessories.  We include, with the replacement parts that we sell to our customers, documentation certifying that each part complies with applicable regulatory requirements and meets applicable standards of airworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries.  In addition, our repair and overhaul operations are subject to certification pursuant to regulations established by the FAA.  Specific regulations vary from country to country, although compliance with FAA requirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in other countries.  The revocation or suspension of any of our material authorizations or approvals would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  New and more stringent government regulations, if adopted and enacted, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, certain product sales to foreign countries of our Electronic Technologies Group and Flight Support Group require approval or licensing from the United States (""U.S."") government.  Denial of export licenses could reduce our sales to those countries and could have a material adverse effect on our business.16IndexPursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission promulgated disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals (tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten), known as conflict minerals, which are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or one of its adjoining countries.

Additionally, the rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of such minerals used in our manufacturing processes for certain products. The retirement of commercial aircraft could reduce our revenues.Our Flight Support Group designs and manufactures jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts and also repairs, overhauls and distributes jet engine and aircraft components.  If aircraft or engines for which we offer replacement parts or supply repair and overhaul services are retired and there are fewer aircraft that require these parts or services, our revenues may decline.Reductions in defense, space or homeland security spending by U.S. and/or foreign customers could reduce our revenues.In fiscal 2019, approximately 64% of the net sales of our Electronic Technologies Group were derived from the sale of defense, commercial and defense satellite and spacecraft components, and homeland security products.  A decline in defense, space or homeland security budgets or additional restrictions imposed by the U.S. government on sales of products or services to foreign military agencies could lower sales of our products and services.We are subject to the risks associated with sales to foreign customers, which could harm our business.We market our products and services to approximately 110 countries, with approximately 36% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2019 derived from sales to foreign customers.  We expect that sales to foreign customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future.  As a result, we are subject to risks of doing business internationally, including the following:•Fluctuations in currency exchange rates;•Volatility in foreign political, regulatory, and economic environments;•Ability to obtain required export licenses or approvals;•Uncertainty of the ability of foreign customers to finance purchases;•Uncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of funding credit or guarantees;•Imposition of taxes, export controls, tariffs, embargoes and other trade restrictions; and17Index•Compliance with a variety of international laws, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.While the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Intense competition from existing and new competitors may harm our business. We face significant competition in each of our businesses. Flight Support Group •For jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts, we compete with the industry’s leading jet engine and aircraft component OEMs.  •For the distribution, overhaul and repair of jet engine and aircraft components and avionics and navigation systems as well as the manufacture of specialty aircraft and defense related parts, we compete with:-major commercial airlines, many of which operate their own maintenance and overhaul units;- OEMs, which manufacture, distribute, repair and overhaul their own and other OEM parts; and - other independent service companies.Electronic Technologies Group•For the design and manufacture of various types of electronic, data and microwave, and electro-optical equipment products, we compete in a fragmented marketplace with a number of companies, some of which are well capitalized.The aviation aftermarket supply industry is highly fragmented, has several highly visible leading companies, and is characterized by intense competition.  Some of our OEM competitors have greater name recognition than HEICO, as well as complementary lines of business and financial, marketing and other resources that HEICO does not have.  In addition, OEMs, aircraft maintenance providers, leasing companies and FAA-certificated repair facilities may attempt to bundle their services and product offerings in the supply industry, thereby significantly increasing industry competition.  Moreover, our smaller competitors may be able to offer more attractive pricing of parts as a result of lower labor costs or other factors.  A variety of potential actions by any of our competitors, including a reduction of product prices or the establishment by competitors of long-term relationships with new or existing customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Competition typically intensifies during cyclical downturns in the aviation industry, when supply may exceed demand.  We may not be able to continue to compete effectively against present or future competitors, and competitive pressures may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.18IndexOur success is dependent on the development and manufacture of new products, equipment and services.  Our inability to develop, manufacture and introduce new products and services at profitable pricing levels could reduce our sales or sales growth.The aviation, defense, space, medical, telecommunications and electronics industries are constantly undergoing development and change and, accordingly, new products, equipment and methods of repair and overhaul service are likely to be introduced in the future.  In addition to manufacturing electronic and electro-optical equipment and selected aerospace and defense components for OEMs and the U.S. government and repairing jet engine and aircraft components, we re-design sophisticated aircraft replacement parts originally developed by OEMs so that we can offer the replacement parts for sale at substantially lower prices than those manufactured by the OEMs.  Consequently, we devote substantial resources to research and product development.  Technological development poses a number of challenges and risks, including the following:•We may not be able to successfully protect the proprietary interests we have in various aircraft parts, electronic and electro-optical equipment and our repair processes;•As OEMs continue to develop and improve jet engines and aircraft components, we may not be able to re-design and manufacture replacement parts that perform as well as those offered by OEMs or we may not be able to profitably sell our replacement parts at lower prices than the OEMs;•We may need to expend significant capital to:-purchase new equipment and machines,-train employees in new methods of production and service, and-fund the research and development of new products; and •Development by our competitors of patents or methodologies that preclude us from the design and manufacture of aircraft replacement parts or electrical and electro-optical equipment could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.In addition, we may not be able to successfully develop new products, equipment or methods of repair and overhaul service, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may not be able to effectively execute our acquisition strategy, which could slow our growth.A key element of our strategy is growth through the acquisition of additional companies.  Our acquisition strategy is affected by and poses a number of challenges and risks, including the following:•Availability of suitable acquisition candidates;19Index•Availability of capital;•Diversion of management’s attention;•Effective integration of the operations and personnel of acquired companies;•Potential write downs of acquired intangible assets;•Potential loss of key employees of acquired companies;•Use of a significant portion of our available cash;•Significant dilution to our shareholders for acquisitions made utilizing our securities; and•Consummation of acquisitions on satisfactory terms.We may not be able to successfully execute our acquisition strategy, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Goodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant portion of our total assets, and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets.As a result of our acquisitions, goodwill and intangible assets represent a significant portion of our total assets.  As of October 31, 2019 and 2018, goodwill and intangible assets, net of amortization, accounted for 61% of our total assets.  We test our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable.  We may not realize the full value of our goodwill and intangible assets, and to the extent that impairment has occurred, we would be required to recognize the impaired portion of such assets in our earnings.  An impairment of a significant portion of such assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The inability to obtain certain components and raw materials from suppliers could harm our business.Our business is affected by the availability and price of the raw materials and component parts that we use to manufacture our products.  Our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers’ ability to adjust delivery of long-lead time products during times of volatile demand.  The supply chains for our business could also be disrupted by external events such as natural disasters, extreme weather events, labor disputes, governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes.  As a result, our suppliers may fail to perform according to specifications when required and we may be unable to identify alternate suppliers or to otherwise mitigate the consequences of their non-performance.  Transitions to new suppliers may result in significant costs and delays, including those related to the required recertification of parts obtained from new suppliers with our customers and/or regulatory agencies.  Our inability to fill our supply needs could jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under customer contracts, which could result in reduced revenues and profits, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships.  Further, increased costs of such raw materials or components could reduce our profits if we were unable to pass along such price increases to our customers.20IndexProduct specification costs and requirements could cause an increase to our costs to complete contracts.The costs to meet customer specifications and requirements could result in us having to spend more to design or manufacture products and this could reduce our profit margins on current contracts or those we obtain in the future.We may incur product liability claims that are not fully insured and such insurance may not be available at commercially reasonable rates.Our jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts and repair and overhaul services expose our business to potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of an aircraft component that we have designed, manufactured or serviced.  While we maintain liability insurance to protect us from future product liability claims, an uninsured or partially insured claim, or a claim for which third-party indemnification is not available, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Additionally, our customers typically require us to maintain substantial insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates and our inability to obtain insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates could have a material adverse effect on our business.  We may incur environmental liabilities and these liabilities may not be covered by insurance.Our operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, which govern, among other things, the discharge of hazardous materials into the air and water as well as the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials.  Pursuant to various environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous materials.  Environmental laws typically impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous materials.  Although management believes that our operations and facilities are in material compliance with environmental laws and regulations, future changes in them or interpretations thereof or the nature of our operations may require us to make significant additional capital expenditures to ensure compliance in the future.We carry limited specific environmental insurance, thus, losses could occur for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage.  The occurrence of an event that is not covered in full or in part by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may incur damages or disruption to our business caused by natural disasters and other factors that may not be covered by insurance.Several of our facilities, as a result of their locations, could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, floods, fire, power loss, telecommunication and information systems failure, political unrest or similar events.  Our corporate headquarters 21Indexand facilities located in Florida are particularly susceptible to hurricanes, storms, tornadoes or other natural disasters that could disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility or facilities.  Should insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms, such as our existing disaster recovery and business continuity plans, be insufficient to recover all costs, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Cyber security events or other disruptions of our information technology systems could adversely affect our business.We rely on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities.  We also collect and store sensitive data, including confidential business information and personal data.  These systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events.  In addition, security breaches of our systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers.  Any such events could disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in defective products or services, damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal claims or proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Tax changes could affect our effective tax rate and future profitability.We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, multiple state jurisdictions and certain jurisdictions outside the U.S.  In fiscal 2019, our effective tax rate was 17.8%.  Our future effective tax rate may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including the following:•Changes in statutory tax rates in any of the various jurisdictions where we file tax returns; •Changes in available tax credits or tax deductions;•Changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws including interpretations, amendments and technical corrections of the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act;•Changes to the accounting for income taxes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles;•The amount of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in our subsidiaries structured as partnerships;•Changes in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates;•Adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; •Resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities; and•The reversal of any previously experienced tax-exempt unrealized gains in the cash surrender values of life insurance policies related to the HEICO Corporation Leadership Compensation Plan, a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.    22IndexAny significant increase in our future effective tax rates could have a material adverse effect on net income for future periods.We may not have the administrative, operational or financial resources to continue to grow the company.We have experienced rapid growth in recent periods and intend to continue to pursue an aggressive growth strategy, both through acquisitions and internal expansion of products and services.  Our growth to date has placed, and could continue to place, significant demands on our administrative, operational and financial resources.  We may not be able to grow effectively or manage our growth successfully, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are dependent on key personnel and the loss of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our success.Our success substantially depends on the performance, contributions and expertise of our senior management team led by Laurans A.

The retirement of commercial aircraft could reduce our revenues.Our Flight Support Group designs and manufactures jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts and also repairs, overhauls and distributes jet engine and aircraft components.  If aircraft or engines for which we offer replacement parts or supply repair and overhaul services are retired and there are fewer aircraft that require these parts or services, our revenues may decline.Reductions in defense, space or homeland security spending by U.S. and/or foreign customers could reduce our revenues.In fiscal 2018, approximately 65% of the net sales of our Electronic Technologies Group were derived from the sale of defense, commercial and defense satellite and spacecraft components, and homeland security products.  A decline in defense, space or homeland security budgets or additional restrictions imposed by the U.S. government on sales of products or services to foreign military agencies could lower sales of our products and services.We are subject to the risks associated with sales to foreign customers, which could harm our business.We market our products and services to approximately 115 countries, with approximately 37% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2018 derived from sales to foreign customers.  We expect that sales to foreign customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future.  As a result, we are subject to risks of doing business internationally, including the following:•Fluctuations in currency exchange rates;•Volatility in foreign political, regulatory, and economic environments;•Ability to obtain required export licenses or approvals;•Uncertainty of the ability of foreign customers to finance purchases;•Uncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of funding credit or guarantees;•Imposition of taxes, export controls, tariffs, embargoes and other trade restrictions; and17Index•Compliance with a variety of international laws, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.While the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Intense competition from existing and new competitors may harm our business. We face significant competition in each of our businesses. Flight Support Group •For jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts, we compete with the industry’s leading jet engine and aircraft component OEMs.  •For the distribution, overhaul and repair of jet engine and aircraft components as well as avionics and navigation systems, we compete with:-major commercial airlines, many of which operate their own maintenance and overhaul units;- OEMs, which manufacture, distribute, repair and overhaul their own and other OEM parts; and - other independent service companies.Electronic Technologies Group•For the design and manufacture of various types of electronic and electro-optical equipment as well as high voltage interconnection devices and high speed interface products, we compete in a fragmented marketplace with a number of companies, some of which are well capitalized.The aviation aftermarket supply industry is highly fragmented, has several highly visible leading companies, and is characterized by intense competition.  Some of our OEM competitors have greater name recognition than HEICO, as well as complementary lines of business and financial, marketing and other resources that HEICO does not have.  In addition, OEMs, aircraft maintenance providers, leasing companies and FAA-certificated repair facilities may attempt to bundle their services and product offerings in the supply industry, thereby significantly increasing industry competition.  Moreover, our smaller competitors may be able to offer more attractive pricing of parts as a result of lower labor costs or other factors.  A variety of potential actions by any of our competitors, including a reduction of product prices or the establishment by competitors of long-term relationships with new or existing customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Competition typically intensifies during cyclical downturns in the aviation industry, when supply may exceed demand.  We may not be able to continue to compete effectively against present or future competitors, and competitive pressures may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.18IndexOur success is dependent on the development and manufacture of new products, equipment and services.  Our inability to develop, manufacture and introduce new products and services at profitable pricing levels could reduce our sales or sales growth.The aviation, defense, space, medical, telecommunications and electronics industries are constantly undergoing development and change and, accordingly, new products, equipment and methods of repair and overhaul service are likely to be introduced in the future.  In addition to manufacturing electronic and electro-optical equipment and selected aerospace and defense components for OEMs and the U.S. government and repairing jet engine and aircraft components, we re-design sophisticated aircraft replacement parts originally developed by OEMs so that we can offer the replacement parts for sale at substantially lower prices than those manufactured by the OEMs.  Consequently, we devote substantial resources to research and product development.  Technological development poses a number of challenges and risks, including the following:•We may not be able to successfully protect the proprietary interests we have in various aircraft parts, electronic and electro-optical equipment and our repair processes;•As OEMs continue to develop and improve jet engines and aircraft components, we may not be able to re-design and manufacture replacement parts that perform as well as those offered by OEMs or we may not be able to profitably sell our replacement parts at lower prices than the OEMs;•We may need to expend significant capital to:-purchase new equipment and machines,-train employees in new methods of production and service, and-fund the research and development of new products; and •Development by our competitors of patents or methodologies that preclude us from the design and manufacture of aircraft replacement parts or electrical and electro-optical equipment could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.In addition, we may not be able to successfully develop new products, equipment or methods of repair and overhaul service, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may not be able to effectively execute our acquisition strategy, which could slow our growth.A key element of our strategy is growth through the acquisition of additional companies.  Our acquisition strategy is affected by and poses a number of challenges and risks, including the following:•Availability of suitable acquisition candidates;19Index•Availability of capital;•Diversion of management’s attention;•Effective integration of the operations and personnel of acquired companies;•Potential write downs of acquired intangible assets;•Potential loss of key employees of acquired companies;•Use of a significant portion of our available cash;•Significant dilution to our shareholders for acquisitions made utilizing our securities; and•Consummation of acquisitions on satisfactory terms.We may not be able to successfully execute our acquisition strategy, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Goodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant portion of our total assets, and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets.As a result of our acquisitions, goodwill and intangible assets represent a significant portion of our total assets.  As of October 31, 2018 and 2017, goodwill and intangible assets, net of amortization, accounted for approximately 61% and 64% of our total assets, respectively.  We test our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable.  We may not realize the full value of our goodwill and intangible assets, and to the extent that impairment has occurred, we would be required to recognize the impaired portion of such assets in our earnings.  An impairment of a significant portion of such assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The inability to obtain certain components and raw materials from suppliers could harm our business.Our business is affected by the availability and price of the raw materials and component parts that we use to manufacture our products.  Our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers’ ability to adjust delivery of long-lead time products during times of volatile demand.  The supply chains for our business could also be disrupted by external events such as natural disasters, extreme weather events, labor disputes, governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes.  As a result, our suppliers may fail to perform according to specifications when required and we may be unable to identify alternate suppliers or to otherwise mitigate the consequences of their non-performance.  Transitions to new suppliers may result in significant costs and delays, including those related to the required recertification of parts obtained from new suppliers with our customers and/or regulatory agencies.  Our inability to fill our supply needs could jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under customer contracts, which could result in reduced revenues and profits, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships.  Further, increased costs of such raw materials or components could reduce our profits if we were unable to pass along such price increases to our customers.20IndexProduct specification costs and requirements could cause an increase to our costs to complete contracts.The costs to meet customer specifications and requirements could result in us having to spend more to design or manufacture products and this could reduce our profit margins on current contracts or those we obtain in the future.We may incur product liability claims that are not fully insured and such insurance may not be available at commercially reasonable rates.Our jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts and repair and overhaul services expose our business to potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of an aircraft component that we have designed, manufactured or serviced.  While we maintain liability insurance to protect us from future product liability claims, an uninsured or partially insured claim, or a claim for which third-party indemnification is not available, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Additionally, our customers typically require us to maintain substantial insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates and our inability to obtain insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates could have a material adverse effect on our business.  We may incur environmental liabilities and these liabilities may not be covered by insurance.Our operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, which govern, among other things, the discharge of hazardous materials into the air and water as well as the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials.  Pursuant to various environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous materials.  Environmental laws typically impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous materials.  Although management believes that our operations and facilities are in material compliance with environmental laws and regulations, future changes in them or interpretations thereof or the nature of our operations may require us to make significant additional capital expenditures to ensure compliance in the future.We carry limited specific environmental insurance, thus, losses could occur for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage.  The occurrence of an event that is not covered in full or in part by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may incur damages or disruption to our business caused by natural disasters and other factors that may not be covered by insurance.Several of our facilities, as a result of their locations, could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, floods, fire, power loss, telecommunication and information systems failure, political unrest or similar events.  Our corporate headquarters 21Indexand facilities located in Florida are particularly susceptible to hurricanes, storms, tornadoes or other natural disasters that could disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility or facilities.  Should insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms, such as our existing disaster recovery and business continuity plans, be insufficient to recover all costs, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Cyber security events or other disruptions of our information technology systems could adversely affect our business.We rely on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities.  We also collect and store sensitive data, including confidential business information and personal data.  These systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events.  In addition, security breaches of our systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers.  Any such events could disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in defective products or services, damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal claims or proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Tax changes could affect our effective tax rate and future profitability.We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, multiple state jurisdictions and certain jurisdictions outside the U.S.  In fiscal 2018, our effective tax rate was 19.8%.  Our future effective tax rate may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including the following:•Changes in available tax credits or tax deductions;•Changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles;•The amount of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests in our subsidiaries structured as partnerships;•Changes in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates;•Adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; •Resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities;•Changes in statutory tax rates in any of the various jurisdictions where we file tax returns; and•The reversal of any previously experienced tax-exempt unrealized gains in the cash surrender values of life insurance policies related to the HEICO Corporation Leadership Compensation Plan, a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.    22IndexAny significant increase in our future effective tax rates could have a material adverse effect on net income for future periods.Federal income tax reform could materially affect the tax aspects of our business and the industries in which we compete.On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”).  The Tax Act contains significant changes to existing tax law including, among other things, a reduction in the U.S. federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% and the implementation of a territorial tax system resulting in a one-time transition tax on the unremitted earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries.  The Tax Act also contains additional provisions that will become effective for HEICO in fiscal 2019 including a new tax on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, a new deduction for Foreign-Derived Intangible Income, the repeal of the domestic production activity deduction and additional limitations on the deductibility of certain executive compensation.  The Tax Act is unclear in many respects and could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, as well as interpretations and implementation of regulations by the U.S. Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service (""IRS""), any of which could lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation.  In addition, it is unclear how these U.S. federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation, which often uses federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities, or how the changes will be viewed by foreign governments. Our analysis and interpretation of the Tax Act is preliminary and ongoing, and our implementation may include judgments and estimates that differ from the final IRS regulations.  As such, to the extent that tax reforms, if any, have a negative effect on us or the industries we serve, these changes may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may not have the administrative, operational or financial resources to continue to grow the company.We have experienced rapid growth in recent periods and intend to continue to pursue an aggressive growth strategy, both through acquisitions and internal expansion of products and services.  Our growth to date has placed, and could continue to place, significant demands on our administrative, operational and financial resources.  We may not be able to grow effectively or manage our growth successfully, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are dependent on key personnel and the loss of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our success.Our success substantially depends on the performance, contributions and expertise of our senior management team led by Laurans A. Mendelson, our Chairman and Chief Executive 23IndexOfficer, and Eric A. Mendelson and Victor H. Mendelson, our Co-Presidents.  Technical employees are also critical to our research and product development, as well as our ability to continue to re-design sophisticated products of OEMs in order to sell competing replacement parts at substantially lower prices than those manufactured by the OEMs.  The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees or our inability to continue to attract or retain the necessary personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our executive officers and directors have significant influence over our management and direction.As of December 18, 2018, collectively our executive officers and entities controlled by them, the HEICO Savings and Investment Plan (our 401(k) Plan) and members of the Board of Directors beneficially owned approximately 20% of our outstanding Common Stock and approximately 5% of our outstanding Class A Common Stock.  Accordingly, they will be able to substantially influence the election of the Board of Directors and control our business, policies and affairs, including our position with respect to proposed business combinations and attempted takeovers"
2,HEI,HEICO CORP,2017-12-21,"    RISK FACTORSOur business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows may be impacted by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including those set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, any one of which may cause our actual results to differ materially from anticipated results:Our success is highly dependent on the performance of the aviation industry, which could be impacted by lower demand for commercial air travel or airline fleet changes causing lower demand for our goods and services.     General global industry and economic conditions that affect the aviation industry also affect our business.  We are subject to macroeconomic cycles and when recessions occur, we may experience reduced orders, payment delays, supply chain disruptions or other factors as a result of the economic challenges faced by our customers, prospective customers and suppliers.  Further, the aviation industry has historically been subject to downward cycles from time to time which reduce the overall demand for jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts and repair and overhaul services, and such downward cycles result in lower sales and greater credit risk.  Demand for commercial air travel can be influenced by airline industry profitability, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, terrorism, disease outbreaks, environmental constraints imposed upon aircraft operations, technological changes, price and other competitive factors.  These global industry and economic conditions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to governmental regulation and our failure to comply with these regulations could cause the government to withdraw or revoke our authorizations and approvals to do business and could subject us to penalties and sanctions that could harm our business.Governmental agencies throughout the world, including the FAA, highly regulate the manufacture, repair and overhaul of aircraft parts and accessories.  We include, with the replacement parts that we sell to our customers, documentation certifying that each part complies with applicable regulatory requirements and meets applicable standards of airworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries.  In addition, our repair and overhaul operations are subject to certification pursuant to regulations established by the FAA.  Specific regulations vary from country to country, although compliance with FAA requirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in other countries.  The revocation or suspension of any of our material authorizations or approvals would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  New and more stringent government regulations, if adopted and enacted, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, certain product sales to foreign countries of our Electronic Technologies Group and Flight Support Group require approval or licensing from the United States (""U.S."") government.  Denial of export licenses could reduce our sales to those countries and could have a material adverse effect on our business.16IndexPursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission promulgated disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals (tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten), known as conflict minerals, which are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or one of its adjoining countries.  There are costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of certain minerals used in our products, as well as costs of possible changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities.  Given the complexity of our supply chain, we may not be able to ascertain the origin of these minerals used in our products in a timely manner, which could cause some of our customers to disqualify us as a supplier to the extent we are unable to certify our products are conflict mineral free.  Additionally, the rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of such minerals used in our manufacturing processes for certain products. The retirement of commercial aircraft could reduce our revenues.Our Flight Support Group designs and manufactures jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts and also repairs, overhauls and distributes jet engine and aircraft components.  If aircraft or engines for which we offer replacement parts or supply repair and overhaul services are retired and there are fewer aircraft that require these parts or services, our revenues may decline.Reductions in defense, space or homeland security spending by U.S. and/or foreign customers could reduce our revenues.In fiscal 2017, approximately 64% of the net sales of our Electronic Technologies Group were derived from the sale of defense, commercial and defense satellite and spacecraft components, and homeland security products.  A decline in defense, space or homeland security budgets or additional restrictions imposed by the U.S. government on sales of products or services to foreign military agencies could lower sales of our products and services.We are subject to the risks associated with sales to foreign customers, which could harm our business.We market our products and services to approximately 110 countries, with approximately 34% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2017 derived from sales to foreign customers.  We expect that sales to foreign customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future.  As a result, we are subject to risks of doing business internationally, including the following:•Fluctuations in currency exchange rates;•Volatility in foreign political, regulatory, and economic environments;•Ability to obtain required export licenses or approvals;•Uncertainty of the ability of foreign customers to finance purchases;•Uncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of funding credit or guarantees;•Imposition of taxes, export controls, tariffs, embargoes and other trade restrictions; and17Index•Compliance with a variety of international laws, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.While the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Intense competition from existing and new competitors may harm our business. We face significant competition in each of our businesses. Flight Support Group •For jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts, we compete with the industry’s leading jet engine and aircraft component OEMs.  •For the distribution, overhaul and repair of jet engine and aircraft components as well as avionics and navigation systems, we compete with:-major commercial airlines, many of which operate their own maintenance and overhaul units;- OEMs, which manufacture, distribute, repair and overhaul their own and other OEM parts;

and•Consummation of acquisitions on satisfactory terms.We may not be able to successfully execute our acquisition strategy, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Goodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant portion of our total assets, and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets.As a result of our acquisitions, goodwill and intangible assets represent a significant portion of our total assets.  As of October 31, 2017 and 2016, goodwill and intangible assets, net of amortization, accounted for approximately 64% and 62% of our total assets, respectively.  We test our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable.

Additionally, our customers typically require us to maintain substantial insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates and our inability to obtain insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates could have a material adverse effect on our business.  We may incur environmental liabilities and these liabilities may not be covered by insurance.Our operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, which govern, among other things, the discharge of hazardous materials into the air and water as well as the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials.  Pursuant to various environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous materials.  Environmental laws typically impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous materials.  Although management believes that our operations and facilities are in material compliance with environmental laws and regulations, future changes in them or interpretations thereof or the nature of our operations may require us to make significant additional capital expenditures to ensure compliance in the future.We carry limited specific environmental insurance, thus, losses could occur for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage.

Technical employees are also critical to our research and product development, as well as our ability to continue to re-design sophisticated products of OEMs in order to sell competing replacement parts at substantially lower prices than those manufactured by the OEMs.  The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees or our inability to continue to attract or retain the necessary personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our executive officers and directors have significant influence over our management and direction.As of December 19, 2017, collectively our executive officers and entities controlled by them, the HEICO Savings and Investment Plan (our 401(k) Plan) and members of the Board of Directors beneficially owned approximately 22% of our outstanding Common Stock and approximately 6% of our outstanding Class A Common Stock.  Accordingly, they will be able to substantially influence the election of the Board of Directors and control our business, policies and affairs, including our position with respect to proposed business combinations and attempted takeovers.23Index"
0,HEI,HEICO CORP,2016-12-15,"    RISK FACTORSOur business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows may be impacted by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including those set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, any one of which may cause our actual results to differ materially from anticipated results:Our success is highly dependent on the performance of the aviation industry, which could be impacted by lower demand for commercial air travel or airline fleet changes causing lower demand for our goods and services.     General global industry and economic conditions that affect the aviation industry also affect our business.  We are subject to macroeconomic cycles and when recessions occur, we may experience reduced orders, payment delays, supply chain disruptions or other factors as a result of the economic challenges faced by our customers, prospective customers and suppliers.  Further, the aviation industry has historically been subject to downward cycles from time to time which reduce the overall demand for jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts and repair and overhaul services, and such downward cycles result in lower sales and greater credit risk.  Demand for commercial air travel can be influenced by airline industry profitability, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, terrorism, disease outbreaks, environmental constraints imposed upon aircraft operations, technological changes, price and other competitive factors.  These global industry and economic conditions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to governmental regulation and our failure to comply with these regulations could cause the government to withdraw or revoke our authorizations and approvals to do business and could subject us to penalties and sanctions that could harm our business.Governmental agencies throughout the world, including the FAA, highly regulate the manufacture, repair and overhaul of aircraft parts and accessories.  We include, with the replacement parts that we sell to our customers, documentation certifying that each part complies with applicable regulatory requirements and meets applicable standards of airworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries.  In addition, our repair and overhaul operations are subject to certification pursuant to regulations established by the FAA.  Specific regulations vary from country to country, although compliance with FAA requirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in other countries.  The revocation or suspension of any of our material authorizations or approvals would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  New and more stringent government regulations, if adopted and enacted, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial 15Indexcondition and results of operations.  In addition, some sales to foreign countries of the equipment manufactured by our Electronic Technologies Group require approval or licensing from the United States (""U.S."") government.  Denial of export licenses could reduce our sales to those countries and could have a material adverse effect on our business.Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission promulgated disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals (tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten), known as conflict minerals, which are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or one of its adjoining countries.  There are costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of certain minerals used in our products, as well as costs of possible changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities.  Given the complexity of our supply chain, we may not be able to ascertain the origin of these minerals used in our products in a timely manner, which could cause some of our customers to disqualify us as a supplier to the extent we are unable to certify our products are conflict mineral free.  Additionally, the rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of such minerals used in our manufacturing processes for certain products. The retirement of commercial aircraft could reduce our revenues.Our Flight Support Group designs and manufactures jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts and also repairs, overhauls and distributes jet engine and aircraft components.  If aircraft or engines for which we offer replacement parts or supply repair and overhaul services are retired and there are fewer aircraft that require these parts or services, our revenues may decline.Reductions in defense, space or homeland security spending by U.S. and/or foreign customers could reduce our revenues.In fiscal 2016, approximately 65% of the net sales of our Electronic Technologies Group were derived from the sale of defense, commercial and defense satellite and spacecraft components and homeland security products.  A decline in defense, space or homeland security budgets or additional restrictions imposed by the U.S. government on sales of products or services to foreign military agencies could lower sales of our products and services.We are subject to the risks associated with sales to foreign customers, which could harm our business.We market our products and services to approximately 100 countries, with approximately 34% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2016 derived from sales to foreign customers.  We expect that sales to foreign customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future.  As a result, we are subject to risks of doing business internationally, including the following:•Fluctuations in currency exchange rates;16Index•Volatility in foreign political, regulatory, and economic environments;•Ability to obtain required export licenses or approvals;•Uncertainty of the ability of foreign customers to finance purchases;•Uncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of funding credit or guarantees;•Imposition of taxes, export controls, tariffs, embargoes and other trade restrictions; and•Compliance with a variety of international laws, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.While the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Intense competition from existing and new competitors may harm our business. We face significant competition in each of our businesses. Flight Support Group •For jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts, we compete with the industry’s leading jet engine and aircraft component OEMs.  •For the distribution, overhaul and repair of jet engine and aircraft components as well as avionics and navigation systems, we compete with:-major commercial airlines, many of which operate their own maintenance and overhaul units;- OEMs, which manufacture, distribute, repair and overhaul their own and other OEM parts; and - other independent service companies.Electronic Technologies Group•For the design and manufacture of various types of electronic and electro-optical equipment as well as high voltage interconnection devices and high speed interface products, we compete in a fragmented marketplace with a number of companies, some of which are well capitalized.The aviation aftermarket supply industry is highly fragmented, has several highly visible leading companies, and is characterized by intense competition.  Some of our OEM competitors have greater name recognition than HEICO, as well as complementary lines of business and financial, marketing and other resources that HEICO does not have.  In addition, OEMs, aircraft maintenance providers, leasing companies and FAA-certificated repair facilities may attempt to bundle their services and product offerings in the supply industry, thereby significantly increasing industry competition.  Moreover, our smaller competitors may be able to offer more attractive pricing of parts as a result of lower labor costs or other factors.  A variety of potential actions by any of our competitors, including a reduction of product prices or the establishment by 17Indexcompetitors of long-term relationships with new or existing customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Competition typically intensifies during cyclical downturns in the aviation industry, when supply may exceed demand.  We may not be able to continue to compete effectively against present or future competitors, and competitive pressures may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our success is dependent on the development and manufacture of new products, equipment and services.  Our inability to develop, manufacture and introduce new products and services at profitable pricing levels could reduce our sales or sales growth.The aviation, defense, space, medical, telecommunications and electronics industries are constantly undergoing development and change and, accordingly, new products, equipment and methods of repair and overhaul service are likely to be introduced in the future.  In addition to manufacturing electronic and electro-optical equipment and selected aerospace and defense components for OEMs and the U.S. government and repairing jet engine and aircraft components, we re-design sophisticated aircraft replacement parts originally developed by OEMs so that we can offer the replacement parts for sale at substantially lower prices than those manufactured by the OEMs.  Consequently, we devote substantial resources to research and product development.  Technological development poses a number of challenges and risks, including the following:•We may not be able to successfully protect the proprietary interests we have in various aircraft parts, electronic and electro-optical equipment and our repair processes;•As OEMs continue to develop and improve jet engines and aircraft components, we may not be able to re-design and manufacture replacement parts that perform as well as those offered by OEMs or we may not be able to profitably sell our replacement parts at lower prices than the OEMs;•We may need to expend significant capital to:-purchase new equipment and machines,-train employees in new methods of production and service, and-fund the research and development of new products; and •Development by our competitors of patents or methodologies that preclude us from the design and manufacture of aircraft replacement parts or electrical and electro-optical equipment could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.In addition, we may not be able to successfully develop new products, equipment or methods of repair and overhaul service, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.18IndexWe may not be able to effectively execute our acquisition strategy, which could slow our growth.A key element of our strategy is growth through the acquisition of additional companies.  Our acquisition strategy is affected by and poses a number of challenges and risks, including the following:•Availability of suitable acquisition candidates;•Availability of capital;•Diversion of management’s attention;•Effective integration of the operations and personnel of acquired companies;•Potential write downs of acquired intangible assets;•Potential loss of key employees of acquired companies;•Use of a significant portion of our available cash;•Significant dilution to our shareholders for acquisitions made utilizing our securities; and•Consummation of acquisitions on satisfactory terms.We may not be able to successfully execute our acquisition strategy, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Goodwill and other intangible assets represent a significant portion of our total assets, and we may never realize the full value of our intangible assets.As a result of our acquisitions, goodwill and intangible assets represent a significant portion of our total assets.  As of October 31, 2016 and 2015, goodwill and intangible assets, net of amortization, accounted for approximately 60% of our total assets.  We test our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable.  We may not realize the full value of our goodwill and intangible assets, and to the extent that impairment has occurred, we would be required to recognize the impaired portion of such assets in our earnings.  An impairment of a significant portion of such assets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The inability to obtain certain components and raw materials from suppliers could harm our business.Our business is affected by the availability and price of the raw materials and component parts that we use to manufacture our products.  Our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers’ ability to adjust delivery of long-lead time products during times of volatile demand.  The supply chains for our business could also be disrupted by external events such as natural disasters, extreme weather events, labor disputes, governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes.  As a result, our suppliers may fail to perform according to specifications when required and we may be unable to identify alternate suppliers or to otherwise mitigate the consequences of their non-performance.  Transitions to 19Indexnew suppliers may result in significant costs and delays, including those related to the required recertification of parts obtained from new suppliers with our customers and/or regulatory agencies.  Our inability to fill our supply needs could jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under customer contracts, which could result in reduced revenues and profits, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships.  Further, increased costs of such raw materials or components could reduce our profits if we were unable to pass along such price increases to our customers.Product specification costs and requirements could cause an increase to our costs to complete contracts.The costs to meet customer specifications and requirements could result in us having to spend more to design or manufacture products and this could reduce our profit margins on current contracts or those we obtain in the future.We may incur product liability claims that are not fully insured.Our jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts and repair and overhaul services expose our business to potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of an aircraft component that we have designed, manufactured or serviced.  While we maintain liability insurance to protect us from future product liability claims, an uninsured or partially insured claim, or a claim for which third-party indemnification is not available, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Additionally, our customers typically require us to maintain substantial insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates and our inability to obtain insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates could have a material adverse effect on our business.  We may incur environmental liabilities and these liabilities may not be covered by insurance.Our operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, which govern, among other things, the discharge of hazardous materials into the air and water as well as the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials.  Pursuant to various environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous materials.  Environmental laws typically impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous materials.  Although management believes that our operations and facilities are in material compliance with environmental laws and regulations, future changes in them or interpretations thereof or the nature of our operations may require us to make significant additional capital expenditures to ensure compliance in the future.We carry limited specific environmental insurance, thus, losses could occur for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage.  The occurrence of an event that is not covered in full or in part by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.20IndexWe may incur damages or disruption to our business caused by natural disasters and other factors that may not be covered by insurance.Several of our facilities, as a result of their locations, could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, floods, fire, power loss, telecommunication and information systems failure, political unrest or similar events.  Our corporate headquarters and facilities located in Florida are particularly susceptible to hurricanes, storms, tornadoes or other natural disasters that could disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility or facilities.  Should insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms, such as our existing disaster recovery and business continuity plans, be insufficient to recover all costs, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We rely on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities.  We also collect and store sensitive data, including confidential business information and personal data.  These systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events.  In addition, security breaches of our systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers.  Any such events could disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in defective products or services, damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal claims or proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Tax changes could affect our effective tax rate and future profitability.We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, multiple state jurisdictions and certain jurisdictions outside the U.S.  In fiscal 2016, our effective tax rate was 31.5%.  Our future effective tax rate may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including the following:•Changes in available tax credits or tax deductions;•Changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles;•The amount of income attributable to noncontrolling interests;•Changes in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates;•Adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; •Resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities;•Changes in statutory tax rates in any of the various jurisdictions where we file tax returns; and•The reversal of any previously experienced tax-exempt unrealized gains in the cash surrender values of life insurance policies related to the HEICO Corporation Leadership Compensation Plan, a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.    21IndexAny significant increase in our future effective tax rates could have a material adverse effect on net income for future periods.We may not have the administrative, operational or financial resources to continue to grow the company.We have experienced rapid growth in recent periods and intend to continue to pursue an aggressive growth strategy, both through acquisitions and internal expansion of products and services.  Our growth to date has placed, and could continue to place, significant demands on our administrative, operational and financial resources.  We may not be able to grow effectively or manage our growth successfully, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are dependent on key personnel and the loss of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our success.Our success substantially depends on the performance, contributions and expertise of our senior management team led by Laurans A. Mendelson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Eric A. Mendelson and Victor H. Mendelson, our Co-Presidents.

Tax changes could affect our effective tax rate and future profitability.We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, multiple state jurisdictions and certain jurisdictions outside the U.S.  In fiscal 2015, our effective tax rate was 31.7%.  Our future effective tax rate may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including the following:•Changes in available tax credits or tax deductions;•Changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles;•The amount of income attributable to noncontrolling interests;•Changes in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates;•Adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; •Resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities;•Changes in statutory tax rates in any of the various jurisdictions where we file tax returns; and•The reversal of any previously experienced tax-exempt unrealized gains in the cash surrender values of life insurance policies related to the HEICO Corporation Leadership Compensation Plan, a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.    Any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could have a material adverse effect on net income for future periods.We may not have the administrative, operational or financial resources to continue to grow the company.We have experienced rapid growth in recent periods and intend to continue to pursue an aggressive growth strategy, both through acquisitions and internal expansion of products and services.  Our growth to date has placed, and could continue to place, significant demands on our administrative, operational and financial resources.  We may not be able to grow effectively or manage our growth successfully, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.21IndexWe are dependent on key personnel and the loss of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our success.Our success substantially depends on the performance, contributions and expertise of our senior management team led by Laurans A. Mendelson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Eric A. Mendelson and Victor H. Mendelson, our Co-Presidents.  Technical employees are also critical to our research and product development, as well as our ability to continue to re-design sophisticated products of OEMs in order to sell competing replacement parts at substantially lower prices than those manufactured by the OEMs.  The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees or our inability to continue to attract or retain the necessary personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our executive officers and directors have significant influence over our management and direction.As of December 15, 2015, collectively our executive officers and entities controlled by them, the HEICO Savings and Investment Plan (our 401(k) Plan) and members of the Board of Directors beneficially owned approximately 22% of our outstanding Common Stock and approximately 6% of our outstanding Class A Common Stock.  Accordingly, they will be able to substantially influence the election of the Board of Directors and control our business, policies and affairs, including our position with respect to proposed business combinations and attempted takeovers"
12,HEI,HEICO CORP,2014-12-18,"    RISK FACTORSOur business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including those set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, any one of which may cause our actual results to differ materially from anticipated results:Our success is highly dependent on the performance of the aviation industry, which could be impacted by lower demand for commercial air travel or airline fleet changes causing lower demand for our goods and services.     General global industry and economic conditions that affect the aviation industry also affect our business.  We are subject to macroeconomic cycles and when recessions occur, we may experience reduced orders, payment delays, supply chain disruptions or other factors as a result of the economic challenges faced by our customers, prospective customers and suppliers.  Further, the aviation industry has historically been subject to downward cycles from time to time which reduce the overall demand for jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts and repair and overhaul services, and such downward cycles result in lower sales and greater credit risk.  Demand for commercial air travel can be influenced by airline industry profitability, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, terrorism, disease outbreaks, environmental constraints imposed upon aircraft operations, technological changes, price and other competitive factors.  These global industry and economic conditions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are subject to governmental regulation and our failure to comply with these regulations could cause the government to withdraw or revoke our authorizations and approvals to do business and could subject us to penalties and sanctions that could harm our business.Governmental agencies throughout the world, including the FAA, highly regulate the manufacture, repair and overhaul of aircraft parts and accessories.  We include, with the replacement parts that we sell to our customers, documentation certifying that each part complies with applicable regulatory requirements and meets applicable standards of airworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries.  In addition, our repair and overhaul operations are subject to certification pursuant to regulations established by the FAA.  Specific regulations vary from country to country, although compliance with FAA requirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in other countries.  The revocation or suspension of any of our material authorizations or approvals would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  New and more stringent government regulations, if adopted and enacted, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, some sales to foreign countries of the equipment manufactured by our Electronic Technologies Group require approval or licensing from the U.S. government.  Denial of export licenses could reduce our sales to those countries and could have a material adverse effect on our business.15IndexPursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission promulgated disclosure requirements regarding the use of certain minerals (tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten), known as conflict minerals, which are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or one of its adjoining countries.  There will be costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of certain minerals used in our products, as well as costs of possible changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities.  Given the complexity of our supply chain, we may not be able to ascertain the origin of these minerals used in our products in a timely manner, which could cause some of our customers to disqualify us as a supplier to the extent we are unable to certify our products are conflict mineral free.  Additionally, the rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of such minerals used in our manufacturing processes for certain products. The retirement of commercial aircraft could reduce our revenues.Our Flight Support Group designs and manufactures jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts and also repairs, overhauls and distributes jet engine and aircraft components.  If aircraft or engines for which we offer replacement parts or supply repair and overhaul services are retired and there are fewer aircraft that require these parts or services, our revenues may decline.Reductions in defense, space or homeland security spending by U.S. and/or foreign customers could reduce our revenues.In fiscal 2014, approximately 55% of the sales of our Electronic Technologies Group were derived from the sale of defense, commercial and defense satellite and spacecraft components and homeland security products.  A decline in defense, space or homeland security budgets or additional restrictions imposed by the U.S. government on sales of products or services to foreign military agencies could lower sales of our products and services.We are subject to the risks associated with sales to foreign customers, which could harm our business.We market our products and services in more than 100 countries, with approximately 33% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2014 derived from sales to foreign customers.  We expect that sales to foreign customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future.  As a result, we are subject to risks of doing business internationally, including the following:•Changes in regulatory requirements;•Fluctuations in currency exchange rates;•Volatility in foreign political and economic environments;•Uncertainty of the ability of foreign customers to finance purchases;•Uncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of funding credit or guarantees;•Imposition of taxes, export controls, tariffs, embargoes and other trade restrictions; and16Index•Compliance with a variety of international laws, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.While the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Intense competition from existing and new competitors may harm our business. We face significant competition in each of our businesses. Flight Support Group •For jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts, we compete with the industry’s leading jet engine and aircraft component OEMs, particularly Pratt & Whitney and General Electric.  •For the distribution, overhaul and repair of jet engine and aircraft components as well as avionics and navigation systems, we compete with:-major commercial airlines, many of which operate their own maintenance and overhaul units;- OEMs, which manufacture, distribute, repair and overhaul their own and other OEM parts; and - other independent service companies.Electronic Technologies Group •For the design and manufacture of various types of electronic and electro-optical equipment as well as high voltage interconnection devices and high speed interface products, we compete in a fragmented marketplace with a number of companies, some of which are well capitalized.The aviation aftermarket supply industry is highly fragmented, has several highly visible leading companies, and is characterized by intense competition.  Some of our OEM competitors have greater name recognition than HEICO, as well as complementary lines of business and financial, marketing and other resources that HEICO does not have.  In addition, OEMs, aircraft maintenance providers, leasing companies and FAA-certificated repair facilities may attempt to bundle their services and product offerings in the supply industry, thereby significantly increasing industry competition.  Moreover, our smaller competitors may be able to offer more attractive pricing of parts as a result of lower labor costs or other factors.  A variety of potential actions by any of our competitors, including a reduction of product prices or the establishment by competitors of long-term relationships with new or existing customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Competition typically intensifies during cyclical downturns in the aviation industry, when supply may exceed demand.  We may not be able to continue to compete effectively against present or future 17Indexcompetitors, and competitive pressures may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our success is dependent on the development and manufacture of new products, equipment and services.  Our inability to develop, manufacture and introduce new products and services at profitable pricing levels could reduce our sales or sales growth.The aviation, defense, space, medical, telecommunication and electronics industries are constantly undergoing development and change and, accordingly, new products, equipment and methods of repair and overhaul service are likely to be introduced in the future.  In addition to manufacturing electronic and electro-optical equipment and selected aerospace and defense components for OEMs and the U.S. government and repairing jet engine and aircraft components, we re-design sophisticated aircraft replacement parts originally developed by OEMs so that we can offer the replacement parts for sale at substantially lower prices than those manufactured by the OEMs.  Consequently, we devote substantial resources to research and product development.  Technological development poses a number of challenges and risks, including the following:•We may not be able to successfully protect the proprietary interests we have in various aircraft parts, electronic and electro-optical equipment and our repair processes;•As OEMs continue to develop and improve jet engines and aircraft components, we may not be able to re-design and manufacture replacement parts that perform as well as those offered by OEMs or we may not be able to profitably sell our replacement parts at lower prices than the OEMs;•We may need to expend significant capital to:-purchase new equipment and machines,-train employees in new methods of production and service, and-fund the research and development of new products; and •Development by our competitors of patents or methodologies that preclude us from the design and manufacture of aircraft replacement parts or electrical and electro-optical equipment could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.In addition, we may not be able to successfully develop new products, equipment or methods of repair and overhaul service, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.18IndexWe may not be able to effectively execute our acquisition strategy, which could slow our growth.A key element of our strategy is growth through the acquisition of additional companies.  Our acquisition strategy is affected by and poses a number of challenges and risks, including the following:•Availability of suitable acquisition candidates;•Availability of capital;•Diversion of management’s attention;•Effective integration of the operations and personnel of acquired companies;•Potential write downs of acquired intangible assets;•Potential loss of key employees of acquired companies;•Use of a significant portion of our available cash;•Significant dilution to our shareholders for acquisitions made utilizing our securities; and•Consummation of acquisitions on satisfactory terms.We may not be able to successfully execute our acquisition strategy, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The inability to obtain certain components and raw materials from suppliers could harm our business.Our business is affected by the availability and price of the raw materials and component parts that we use to manufacture our products.  Our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers’ ability to adjust delivery of long-lead time products during times of volatile demand.  The supply chains for our business could also be disrupted by external events such as natural disasters, extreme weather events, labor disputes, governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes.  As a result, our suppliers may fail to perform according to specifications when required and we may be unable to identify alternate suppliers or to otherwise mitigate the consequences of their non-performance.  Transitions to new suppliers may result in significant costs and delays, including those related to the required recertification of parts obtained from new suppliers with our customers and/or regulatory agencies.  Our inability to fill our supply needs could jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under customer contracts, which could result in reduced revenues and profits, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships.  Further, increased costs of such raw materials or components could reduce our profits if we were unable to pass along such price increases to our customers.19IndexProduct specification costs and requirements could cause an increase to our costs to complete contracts.The costs to meet customer specifications and requirements could result in us having to spend more to design or manufacture products and this could reduce our profit margins on current contracts or those we obtain in the future.We may incur product liability claims that are not fully insured.Our jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts and repair and overhaul services expose our business to potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of an aircraft component that we have designed, manufactured or serviced.  While we maintain liability insurance to protect us from future product liability claims, an uninsured or partially insured claim, or a claim for which third-party indemnification is not available, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Additionally, our customers typically require us to maintain substantial insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates and our inability to obtain insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates could have a material adverse effect on our business.  We may incur environmental liabilities and these liabilities may not be covered by insurance.Our operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, which govern, among other things, the discharge of hazardous materials into the air and water as well as the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials.  Pursuant to various environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous materials.  Environmental laws typically impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous materials.  Although management believes that our operations and facilities are in material compliance with environmental laws and regulations, future changes in them or interpretations thereof or the nature of our operations may require us to make significant additional capital expenditures to ensure compliance in the future.We do not maintain specific environmental liability insurance and the expenses related to these environmental liabilities, if we are required to pay them, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may incur damages or disruption to our business caused by natural disasters and other factors that may not be covered by insurance.Several of our facilities, as a result of their locations, could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, floods, fire, power loss, telecommunication and information systems failure or similar events.  Our corporate headquarters and facilities located in Florida are particularly susceptible to hurricanes, storms, tornadoes or other natural disasters that could disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, and result in large 20Indexexpenses to repair or replace the facility or facilities.  Should insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms, such as our existing disaster recovery and business continuity plans, be insufficient to recover all costs, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We rely on information technology systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of critical business processes and activities.  We also collect and store sensitive data, including confidential business information and personal data.  These systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by computer hackers, computer viruses, employee error or malfeasance, power outages, hardware failures, telecommunication or utility failures, catastrophes or other unforeseen events.  In addition, security breaches of our systems could result in the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information or personal data belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers.  Any such events could disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, result in defective products or services, damage customer relationships and our reputation and result in legal claims or proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on our business.  Tax changes could affect our effective tax rate and future profitability.We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, multiple state jurisdictions and certain jurisdictions outside the U.S.  In fiscal 2014, our effective tax rate was 30.1%.  Our future effective tax rate may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including the following:•Changes in available tax credits or tax deductions;•Changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles;•The amount of income attributable to noncontrolling interests;•Changes in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates;•Adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; •Resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities;•Changes in statutory tax rates in any of the various jurisdictions where we file tax returns; and•The reversal of any previously experienced tax-exempt unrealized gains in the cash surrender values of life insurance policies related to the HEICO Corporation Leadership Compensation Plan, a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.Any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could have a material adverse effect on net income for future periods.We may not have the administrative, operational or financial resources to continue to grow the company.We have experienced rapid growth in recent periods and intend to continue to pursue an aggressive growth strategy, both through acquisitions and internal expansion of products and 21Indexservices.  Our growth to date has placed, and could continue to place, significant demands on our administrative, operational and financial resources.  We may not be able to grow effectively or manage our growth successfully, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We are dependent on key personnel and the loss of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our success.Our success substantially depends on the performance, contributions and expertise of our senior management team led by Laurans A.

Tax changes could affect our effective tax rate and future profitability. We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, multiple state jurisdictions and certain jurisdictions outside the U.S.  In fiscal 2013, our effective tax rate was 31.1% of our income before income taxes and noncontrolling interests.  Our future effective tax rate may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including the following:•Changes in available tax credits or tax deductions;•Changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles;•The amount of income attributable to noncontrolling interests:•Changes in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates;•Adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; •Resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities; and•Changes in statutory tax rates in any of the various jurisdictions where we file tax returns.Any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could have a material adverse effect on net income for future periods.21IndexWe may not have the administrative, operational or financial resources to continue to grow the company. We have experienced rapid growth in recent periods and intend to continue to pursue an aggressive growth strategy, both through acquisitions and internal expansion of products and services.  Our growth to date has placed, and could continue to place, significant demands on our administrative, operational and financial resources.  We may not be able to grow effectively or manage our growth successfully, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are dependent on key personnel and the loss of these key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our success. Our success substantially depends on the performance, contributions and expertise of our senior management team led by Laurans A. Mendelson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Eric A. Mendelson, our Co-President; and Victor H. Mendelson, our Co-President.  Technical employees are also critical to our research and product development, as well as our ability to continue to re-design sophisticated products of OEMs in order to sell competing replacement parts at substantially lower prices than those manufactured by the OEMs.  The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees or our inability to continue to attract or retain the necessary personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our executive officers and directors have significant influence over our management and direction. As of December 17, 2013, collectively our executive officers and entities controlled by them, our 401(k) Plan and members of the Board of Directors beneficially owned approximately 21% of our outstanding Common Stock and approximately 6% of our outstanding Class A Common Stock.  Accordingly, they will be able to substantially influence the election of the Board of Directors and control our business, policies and affairs, including our position with respect to proposed business combinations and attempted takeovers"
4,HEI,HEICO CORP,2012-12-20,"    RISK FACTORSOur business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including those set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, any one of which may cause our actual results to differ materially from anticipated results:Our success is highly dependent on the performance of the aviation industry, which could be impacted by lower demand for commercial air travel or airline fleet changes causing lower demand for our goods and services.14Index     General global industry and economic conditions that affect the aviation industry also affect our business.  We are subject to macroeconomic cycles and when recessions occur, we may experience reduced orders, payment delays, supply chain disruptions or other factors as a result of the economic challenges faced by our customers, prospective customers and suppliers.  Further, the aviation industry has historically been subject to downward cycles from time to time which reduce the overall demand for jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts and repair and overhaul services, and such downward cycles result in lower sales and greater credit risk.  Demand for commercial air travel can be influenced by airline industry profitability, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, terrorism, disease outbreaks, environmental constraints imposed upon aircraft operations, technological changes, price and other competitive factors.  These global industry and economic conditions may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to governmental regulation and our failure to comply with these regulations could cause the government to withdraw or revoke our authorizations and approvals to do business and could subject us to penalties and sanctions that could harm our business.Governmental agencies throughout the world, including the FAA, highly regulate the manufacture, repair and overhaul of aircraft parts and accessories.  We include, with the replacement parts that we sell to our customers, documentation certifying that each part complies with applicable regulatory requirements and meets applicable standards of airworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries.  In addition, our repair and overhaul operations are subject to certification pursuant to regulations established by the FAA.  Specific regulations vary from country to country, although compliance with FAA requirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in other countries.  The revocation or suspension of any of our material authorizations or approvals would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  New and more stringent government regulations, if adopted and enacted, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, some sales to foreign countries of the equipment manufactured by our Electronic Technologies Group require approval or licensing from the U.S. government.  Denial of export licenses could reduce our sales to those countries and could have a material adverse effect on our business.Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission promulgated final rules regarding disclosure of the use of certain minerals (tantalum, tin, gold and tungsten), known as conflict minerals, which are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries, as well as procedures regarding a manufacturer's efforts to prevent the sourcing of such minerals and metals produced from those minerals.  These new requirements will require due diligence efforts for the 2013 calendar year, with initial disclosure requirements effective in May 2014.  The new rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of such minerals used in our manufacturing processes for certain products.  The number of suppliers who provide conflict-free minerals may be limited.  In addition, there may be costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of certain 15Indexminerals used in our products, as well as costs of possible changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities.  The retirement of commercial aircraft could reduce our revenues.Our Flight Support Group designs and manufactures jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts and also repairs, overhauls and distributes jet engine and aircraft components.  If aircraft or engines for which we offer replacement parts or supply repair and overhaul services are retired and there are fewer aircraft that require these parts or services, our revenues may decline. Reductions in defense, space or homeland security spending by U.S. and/or foreign customers could reduce our revenues. In fiscal 2012, approximately 51% of the sales of our Electronic Technologies Group were derived from the sale of defense, commercial and defense satellite and spacecraft components and homeland security products.  A decline in defense, space or homeland security budgets or additional restrictions imposed by the U.S. government on sales of products or services to foreign military agencies could lower sales of our products and services.We are subject to the risks associated with sales to foreign customers, which could harm our business. We market our products and services in approximately 100 countries, with 33% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2012 derived from sales to foreign customers.  We expect that sales to foreign customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues in the foreseeable future.  As a result, we are subject to risks of doing business internationally, including the following:•Changes in regulatory requirements;•Fluctuations in currency exchange rates;•Volatility in foreign political and economic environments;•Uncertainty of the ability of foreign customers to finance purchases;•Uncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of funding credit or guarantees;•Imposition of taxes, export controls, tariffs, embargoes and other trade restrictions; and•Compliance with a variety of international laws, as well as U.S. laws affecting the activities of U.S. companies abroad such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.While the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Intense competition from existing and new competitors may harm our business. We face significant competition in each of our businesses. 16IndexFlight Support Group •For jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts, we compete with the industry’s leading jet engine and aircraft component OEMs, particularly Pratt & Whitney and General Electric.  •For the overhaul and repair of jet engine and aircraft components as well as avionics and navigation systems, we compete with:-major commercial airlines, many of which operate their own maintenance and overhaul units;- OEMs, which manufacture, repair and overhaul their own parts; and - other independent service companies.Electronic Technologies Group •For the design and manufacture of various types of electronic and electro-optical equipment as well as high voltage interconnection devices and high speed interface products, we compete in a fragmented marketplace with a number of companies, some of which are well capitalized.The aviation aftermarket supply industry is highly fragmented, has several highly visible leading companies, and is characterized by intense competition.  Some of our OEM competitors have greater name recognition than HEICO, as well as complementary lines of business and financial, marketing and other resources that HEICO does not have.  In addition, OEMs, aircraft maintenance providers, leasing companies and FAA-certificated repair facilities may attempt to bundle their services and product offerings in the supply industry, thereby significantly increasing industry competition.  Moreover, our smaller competitors may be able to offer more attractive pricing of parts as a result of lower labor costs or other factors.  A variety of potential actions by any of our competitors, including a reduction of product prices or the establishment by competitors of long-term relationships with new or existing customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Competition typically intensifies during cyclical downturns in the aviation industry, when supply may exceed demand.  We may not be able to continue to compete effectively against present or future competitors, and competitive pressures may have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.Our success is dependent on the development and manufacture of new products, equipment and services.  Our inability to develop, manufacture and introduce new products and services at profitable pricing levels could reduce our sales or sales growth. The aviation, defense, space, medical, telecommunication and electronic industries are constantly undergoing development and change and, accordingly, new products, equipment and methods of repair and overhaul service are likely to be introduced in the future.  In addition to manufacturing electronic and electro-optical equipment and selected aerospace and defense components for OEMs and the U.S. government and repairing jet engine and aircraft 17Indexcomponents, we re-design sophisticated aircraft replacement parts originally developed by OEMs so that we can offer the replacement parts for sale at substantially lower prices than those manufactured by the OEMs.  Consequently, we devote substantial resources to research and product development.  Technological development poses a number of challenges and risks, including the following: •We may not be able to successfully protect the proprietary interests we have in various aircraft parts, electronic and electro-optical equipment and our repair processes;•As OEMs continue to develop and improve jet engines and aircraft components, we may not be able to re-design and manufacture replacement parts that perform as well as those offered by OEMs or we may not be able to profitably sell our replacement parts at lower prices than the OEMs;•We may need to expend significant capital to:-purchase new equipment and machines,-train employees in new methods of production and service, and-fund the research and development of new products; and •Development by our competitors of patents or methodologies that preclude us from the design and manufacture of aircraft replacement parts or electrical and electro-optical equipment could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.In addition, we may not be able to successfully develop new products, equipment or methods of repair and overhaul service, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to effectively execute our acquisition strategy, which could slow our growth. A key element of our strategy is growth through the acquisition of additional companies.  Our acquisition strategy is affected by and poses a number of challenges and risks, including the following: •Availability of suitable acquisition candidates;•Availability of capital;•Diversion of management’s attention;•Effective integration of the operations and personnel of acquired companies;•Potential write downs of acquired intangible assets;•Potential loss of key employees of acquired companies;•Use of a significant portion of our available cash;•Significant dilution to our shareholders for acquisitions made utilizing our securities; and•Consummation of acquisitions on satisfactory terms.18IndexWe may not be able to successfully execute our acquisition strategy, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The inability to obtain certain components and raw materials from suppliers could harm our business.Our business is affected by the availability and price of the raw materials and component parts that we use to manufacture our products.  Our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers’ ability to adjust delivery of long-lead time products during times of volatile demand.  The supply chains for our business could also be disrupted by external events such as natural disasters, extreme weather events, labor disputes, governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes.  As a result, our suppliers may fail to perform according to specifications when required and we may be unable to identify alternate suppliers or to otherwise mitigate the consequences of their non-performance.  Transitions to new suppliers may result in significant costs and delays, including those related to the required recertification of parts obtained from new suppliers with our customers and/or regulatory agencies.  Our inability to fill our supply needs could jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under customer contracts, which could result in reduced revenues and profits, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships.  Further, increased costs of such raw materials or components could reduce our profits if we were unable to pass along such price increases to our customers.Product specification costs and requirements could cause an increase to our costs to complete contracts. The costs to meet customer specifications and requirements could result in us having to spend more to design or manufacture products and this could reduce our profit margins on current contracts or those we obtain in the future. We may incur product liability claims that are not fully insured. Our jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts and repair and overhaul services expose our business to potential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure of an aircraft component that we have designed, manufactured or serviced.  The commercial aviation industry occasionally has catastrophic losses that may exceed policy limits.  An uninsured or partially insured claim, or a claim for which third-party indemnification is not available, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.  Additionally, insurance coverage costs may become even more expensive in the future.  Our customers typically require us to maintain substantial insurance coverage and our inability to obtain insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates could have a material adverse effect on our business.19IndexWe may incur environmental liabilities and these liabilities may not be covered by insurance.Our operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, which govern, among other things, the discharge of hazardous materials into the air and water as well as the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials.  Pursuant to various environmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous materials.  Environmental laws typically impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous materials.  Although management believes that our operations and facilities are in material compliance with environmental laws and regulations, future changes in them or interpretations thereof or the nature of our operations may require us to make significant additional capital expenditures to ensure compliance in the future.We do not maintain specific environmental liability insurance and the expenses related to these environmental liabilities, if we are required to pay them, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.We may incur damages or disruption to our business caused by natural disasters and other factors that may not be covered by insurance.Several of our facilities, as a result of their locations, could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused by hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, fire, power loss, telecommunication and information systems failure or similar events.  Our corporate headquarters and facilities located in Florida are particularly susceptible to hurricanes, storms, tornadoes or other natural disasters that could disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility or facilities.  Should insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms, such as our existing disaster recovery and business continuity plans, be insufficient to recover all costs, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Tax changes could affect our effective tax rate and future profitability. We file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, multiple state jurisdictions and certain jurisdictions outside the U.S.  In fiscal 2012, our effective tax rate was 33.8% of our income before income taxes and noncontrolling interests.  Our future effective tax rate may be adversely affected by a number of factors, including the following:•Changes in available tax credits or tax deductions;•Changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws and changes in generally accepted accounting principles;•The amount of income attributable to noncontrolling interests;•Changes in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates;•Adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; •Resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities; and20Index•Changes in statutory tax rates in any of the various jurisdictions where we file tax returns.Any significant increase in our future effective tax rates could have a material adverse effect on net income for future periods.We may not have the administrative, operational or financial

16,HEI,HEICO CORP,2010-12-22,">Item 1A.   RISK FACTORSOur business, financial condition, operating results and cashflows can be impacted by a number of factors, many of which are beyond ourcontrol, including those set forth below and elsewhere in this Annual Report onForm 10-K, any one of which may cause our actual results to differ materiallyfrom anticipated results:Oursuccess is highly dependent on the performance of the aviation industry, whichcould be impacted by lower demand for commercial air travel or airline fleetchanges causing lower demand for our goods and services. General global industry and economicconditions that affect the aviation industry also affect ourbusiness.  We are subject to macroeconomic cycles and when recessionsoccur, we may experience reduced orders, payment delays, supply chaindisruptions or other factors as a result of the economic challenges faced by ourcustomers, prospective customers and suppliers.  Further, the aviationindustry has historically been subject to downward cycles from time to timewhich reduce the overall demand for jet engine and aircraft componentreplacement parts and repair and overhaul services, and such downward cyclesresult in lower sales and greater credit risk.  Demand for commercialair travel can be influenced by airline industry profitability, world tradepolicies, government-to-government relations, terrorism, disease outbreaks,environmental constraints imposed upon aircraft operations, technologicalchanges and price and other competitive factors.  These globalindustry and economic conditions may have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. Weare subject to governmental regulation and our failure to comply with theseregulations could cause the government to withdraw or revoke our authorizationsand approvals to do business and could subject us to penalties and sanctionsthat could harm our business. Governmental agencies throughout theworld, including the FAA, highly regulate the manufacture, repair and overhaulof aircraft parts and accessories.  We include, with the replacement partsthat we sell to our customers, documentation certifying that each part complieswith applicable regulatory requirements and meets applicable standards ofairworthiness established by the FAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies inother countries.  In addition, our repair and overhaul operations aresubject to certification pursuant to regulations established by the FAA.Specific regulations vary from country to country, although compliance with FAArequirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in othercountries.  The revocation or suspension of any of our materialauthorizations or approvals would have an adverse effect on our business,financial condition and results of operations.  New and more stringentgovernment regulations, if adopted and enacted, could have an adverse effect onour business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, somesales to foreign countries of the equipment manufactured by our ElectronicTechnologies Group require approval or licensing from the U.S.government.  Denial of export licenses could reduce our sales to thosecountries and could have a material adverse effect on our business. 11 Theretirement of commercial aircraft could reduce our revenues. Our Flight Support Group designs,engineers, manufactures and distributes jet engine and aircraft componentreplacement parts and also repairs, refurbishes and overhauls jet engine andaircraft components.  If aircraft or engines for which we havereplacement parts or supply repair and overhaul services are retired and thereare fewer aircraft that require these parts or services, our revenues maydecline. Reductionsin defense, space or homeland security spending by U.S. and/or foreign customerscould reduce our revenues. In fiscal 2010, approximately 57% ofthe sales of our Electronic Technologies Group were derived from the sale ofdefense, commercial and defense satellite and spacecraft components and homelandsecurity products.  A decline in defense, space or homeland securitybudgets or additional restrictions imposed by the U.S. government on sales ofproducts or services to foreign military agencies could lower sales of ourproducts and services. Weare subject to the risks associated with sales to foreign customers, which couldharm our business. We market our products and services inapproximately 100 countries, with 31% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal2010 derived from sales to foreign customers.  We expect that sales toforeign customers will continue to account for a significant portion of ourrevenues in the foreseeable future.  As a result, we are subject torisks of doing business internationally, including the following:       ·Changes      in regulatory requirements;       ·Fluctuations      in currency exchange rates;       ·Volatility      in foreign political and economicenvironments;       ·Uncertainty      of the ability of foreign customers to finance  purchases;       ·Uncertainties      and restrictions concerning the availability of funding credit or      guarantees;       ·Imposition      of taxes, export controls, tariffs, embargoes and other trade      restrictions; and       ·Compliance      with a variety of international laws, as well as U.S. laws affecting the      activities of U.S. companies abroad such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt      Practices Act.While the impact of these factors isdifficult to predict, any one or more of these factors may have a materialadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results ofoperations. 12 Intensecompetition from existing and new competitors may harm ourbusiness. We face significant competition in eachof our businesses. FlightSupport Group        ·For      jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts, we compete with the      industry’s leading jet engine and aircraft component OEMs, particularly      Pratt & Whitney and GeneralElectric.        ·For      the overhaul and repair of jet engine and aircraft components as well as      avionics and navigation systems, we compete  with:        -major      commercial airlines, many of which operate their own maintenance and      overhaul units;        -OEMs,      which manufacture, repair and overhaul their own parts;  and        -other      independent service companies. ElectronicTechnologies Group        ·For      the design and manufacture of various types of electronic and      electro-optical equipment as well as high voltage interconnection devices      and high speed interface products, we compete in a fragmented marketplace      with a number of companies, some of which are well      capitalized. The aviation aftermarket supplyindustry is highly fragmented, has several highly visible leading companies, andis characterized by intense competition.  Some of our OEM competitorshave greater name recognition than HEICO, as well as complementary lines ofbusiness and financial, marketing and other resources that HEICO does nothave.  In addition, OEMs, aircraft maintenance providers, leasingcompanies and FAA-certificated repair facilities may attempt to bundle theirservices and product offerings in the supply industry, thereby significantlyincreasing industry competition.  Moreover, our smaller competitorsmay be able to offer more attractive pricing of parts as a result of lower laborcosts or other factors.  A variety of potential actions by any of ourcompetitors, including a reduction of product prices or the establishment bycompetitors of long-term relationships with new or existing customers, couldhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and resultsof operations.  Competition typically intensifies during cyclicaldownturns in the aviation industry, when supply may exceed demand.  Wemay not be able to continue to compete effectively against present or futurecompetitors, and competitive pressures may have a material and adverse effect onour business, financial condition and results of operations. Oursuccess is dependent on the development and manufacture of new products,equipment and services.  Our inability to develop, manufacture andintroduce new products and services at profitable pricing levels could reduceour sales or sales growth. The aviation, defense, space, medical,telecommunication and electronic industries are constantly undergoingdevelopment and change and, accordingly, new products, equipment and methods ofrepair and overhaul service are likely to be introduced in thefuture.  In addition to manufacturing electronic and electro-opticalequipment and selected aerospace and defense components for OEMs and the U.S.government and repairing jet engine and aircraft components, we re-designsophisticated aircraft replacement parts originally developed by OEMs so that wecan offer the replacement parts for sale at substantially lower prices thanthose manufactured by the OEMs.  Consequently, we devote substantialresources to research and product development.  Technologicaldevelopment poses a number of challenges and risks, including thefollowing: 13        ·We      may not be able to successfully protect the proprietary interests we have      in various aircraft parts, electronic and electro-optical equipment and      our repair processes;        ·As      OEMs continue to develop and improve jet engines and aircraft components,      we may not be able to re-design and manufacture replacement parts that      perform as well as those offered by OEMs or we may not be able to      profitably sell our replacement parts at lower prices than the      OEMs;        ·We      may need to expend significant capitalto:-      purchasenew equipment and machines,-      trainemployees in new methods of production and service, and-      fund theresearch and development of new products; and        ·Development      by our competitors of patents or methodologies that preclude us from the      design and manufacture of aircraft replacement parts or electrical and      electro-optical equipment could adversely affect our business, financial      condition and results ofoperations. In addition, we may not be able tosuccessfully develop new products, equipment or methods of repair and overhaulservice, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness, financial condition and results of operations. Theinability to obtain certain components and raw materials from suppliers couldharm our business. Our business is affected by theavailability and price of the raw materials and component parts that we use tomanufacture our products.  Our ability to manage inventory and meetdelivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers’ ability to adjustdelivery of long-lead time products during times of volatiledemand.  The supply chains for our business could also be disrupted byexternal events such as natural disasters, extreme weather events, labordisputes, governmental actions and legislative or regulatorychanges.  As a result, our suppliers may fail to perform according tospecifications as and when required and we may be unable to identify alternatesupplier or to otherwise mitigate the consequences of theirnon-performance.  Transitions to new suppliers may result insignificant costs and delays, including those related to the requiredrecertification of parts obtained from new suppliers with our customers and/orregulatory agencies.  Our inability to fill our supply needs couldjeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under customer contracts, whichcould result in reduced revenues and profits, contract penalties orterminations, and damage to customer relationships.  Further,increased costs of such raw materials or components could reduce our profits ifwe were unable to pass along such price increases to our customers. Productspecification costs and requirements could cause an increase to our costs tocomplete contracts. The costs to meet customerspecifications and requirements could result in us having to spend more todesign or manufacture products and this could reduce our profit margins oncurrent contracts or those we obtain in the future. 14 Wemay incur product liability claims that are not fully insured. Our jet engine and aircraft componentreplacement parts and repair and overhaul services expose our business topotential liabilities for personal injury or death as a result of the failure ofan aircraft component that we have designed, manufactured orserviced.  The commercial aviation industry occasionally hascatastrophic losses that may exceed policy limits.  An uninsured orpartially insured claim, or a claim for which third-party indemnification is notavailable, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financialcondition and results of operations.  Additionally, insurance coveragecosts may become even more expensive in the future.  Our customerstypically require us to maintain substantial insurance coverage and ourinability to obtain insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates couldhave a material adverse effect on our business. We may incur environmentalliabilities and these liabilities may not be covered byinsurance.Our operations and facilities aresubject to a number of federal, state and local environmental laws andregulations, which govern, among other things, the discharge of hazardousmaterials into the air and water as well as the handling, storage and disposalof hazardous materials.  Pursuant to various environmental laws, acurrent or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for thecosts of removal or remediation of hazardous materials.  Environmentallaws typically impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of, orwas responsible for, the presence of hazardous materials.  Althoughmanagement believes that our operations and facilities are in materialcompliance with environmental laws and regulations, future changes in them orinterpretations thereof or the nature of our operations may require us to makesignificant additional capital expenditures to ensure compliance in thefuture. We do not maintain specificenvironmental liability insurance and the expenses related to theseenvironmental liabilities, if we are required to pay them, could have a materialadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results ofoperations. Wemay incur damages or disruption to our business caused by natural disasters andother factors that may not be covered by insurance.Several of our facilities, as a resultof their locations, could be subject to a catastrophic loss caused byhurricanes, tornadoes, floods, fire, power loss, telecommunication andinformation systems failure or similar events.  Our corporateheadquarters and facilities located in Florida are particularly susceptible tohurricanes, storms, tornadoes or other natural disasters that could disrupt ouroperations, delay production and shipments, and result in large expenses torepair or replace the facility or facilities.  Should insurance orother risk transfer mechanisms, such as our existing disaster recovery andbusiness continuity plans, be insufficient to recover all costs, we couldexperience a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition andresults of operations.   Taxchanges could affect our effective tax rate and futureprofitability. We file income tax returns in the U.S.federal jurisdiction, multiple state jurisdictions and certain jurisdictionsoutside the U.S.  In fiscal 2010, our effective tax rate was 33.7% ofour income before income taxes and noncontrolling interests.  Ourfuture effective tax rate may be adversely affected by a number of factors,including the following:        ·Changes      in available tax credits or taxdeductions;       ·Changes      in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws and changes in      generally accepted accountingprinciples; 15        ·The      amount of income attributable to noncontrolling  interests;       ·Changes      in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax      rates;       ·Changes      in stock option compensationexpense;       ·Adjustments      to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns;      and/or       ·Resolution      of issues arising from tax audits with various tax      authorities.Any significant increase in our futureeffective tax rates could have a material adverse effect on net income forfuture periods. Wemay not have the administrative, operational or financial resources to continueto grow the company. We have experienced rapid growth inrecent periods and intend to continue to pursue an aggressive growth strategy,both through acquisitions and internal expansion of products andservices.  Our growth to date has placed, and could continue to place,significant demands on our administrative, operational and financialresources.  We may not be able to grow effectively or manage ourgrowth successfully, and the failure to do so could have a material adverseeffect on our business, financial condition and results ofoperations. Wemay not be able to effectively execute our acquisition strategy, which couldslow our growth. A key element of our strategy is growththrough the acquisition of additional companies.  Our acquisitionstrategy is affected by and poses a number of challenges and risks, includingthe following:        ·Availability      of suitable acquisition candidates;       ·Availability      of capital;       ·Diversion      of management’s attention;       ·Effective      integration of the operations and personnel of acquired      companies;       ·Potential      write downs of acquired intangibleassets;       ·Potential      loss of key employees of acquiredcompanies;       ·Use      of a significant portion of our availablecash;       ·Significant      dilution to our shareholders for acquisitions made utilizing our      securities; and       ·Consummation      of acquisitions on satisfactoryterms.We may not be able to successfullyexecute our acquisition strategy, and the failure to do so could have a materialadverse effect on our business, financial condition and results ofoperations. Weare dependent on key personnel and the loss of these key personnel could have amaterial adverse effect on our success. Our success substantially depends onthe performance, contributions and expertise of our senior management team ledby Laurans A. Mendelson, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Eric A.Mendelson, our Co-President, and Victor H. Mendelson, ourCo-President.  Technical employees are also critical to our researchand product development, as well as our ability to continue to re-designsophisticated products of OEMs in order to sell competing replacement parts atsubstantially lower prices than those manufactured by the OEMs.  Theloss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees orour inability to continue to attract or retain the necessary personnel couldhave a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and resultsof operations. 16 Ourexecutive officers and directors have significant influence over our managementand direction. As of December 17, 2010, collectivelyour executive officers and entities controlled by them, our 401(k) Plan andmembers of the Board of Directors beneficially owned approximately 23% of ouroutstanding Common Stock and approximately 6% of our outstanding Class A CommonStock.  Accordingly, they will be able to substantially influence theelection of the Board of Directors and control our business, policies andaffairs, including our position with respect to proposed business combinationsand attempted takeovers. "

RISK FACTORS        Our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows canbe impacted by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control,including but not limited to those set forth below and elsewhere in this AnnualReport on Form 10-K, any one of which may cause our actual results to differmaterially from anticipated results:Our success is highly dependent on the performance of the aviation industry,which could be impacted by lower demand for commercial air travel or airlinefleet changes causing lower demand for our goods and services.        Economic factors and passenger security concerns that affect theaviation industry also affect our business. The aviation industry hashistorically been subject to downward cycles from time to time which reduce theoverall demand for jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts andrepair and overhaul services, and such downward cycles result in lower pricesand greater credit risk. These economic factors and passenger security concernsmay have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, andresults of operations.We are subject to governmental regulation and our failure to comply with theseregulations could cause the government to withdraw or revoke our authorizationsand approvals to do business and could subject us to penalties and sanctionsthat could harm our business.        Governmental agencies throughout the world, including the FAA, highlyregulate the manufacture, repair, and overhaul of aircraft parts andaccessories. We include with the replacement parts that we sell to our customersdocumentation certifying that each part complies with applicable regulatoryrequirements and meets applicable standards of airworthiness established by theFAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. In addition, ourrepair and overhaul operations are subject to certification pursuant toregulations established by the FAA. Specific regulations vary from country tocountry, although compliance with FAA requirements generally satisfiesregulatory requirements in other countries. The revocation or suspension of anyof our material authorizations or approvals would have an adverse effect on ourbusiness, financial condition, and results of operations. New and more stringentgovernment regulations, if adopted and enacted, could have an adverse effect onour business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, somesales to foreign countries of the equipment manufactured by our ElectronicTechnologies Group require approval or licensing from the U.S.                                       11government. Denial of export licenses could reduce our sales to those countriesand could have a material adverse effect on our business.The retirement of commercial aircraft could reduce our revenues.        Our Flight Support Group designs, engineers, manufactures, anddistributes jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts and also offersrepairs, refurbishments, and overhauls of jet engine and aircraft components. Ifaircraft for which we have replacement parts or supply repair and overhaulservices are retired and there are fewer aircraft that require these parts orservices, our revenues may decline.Reductions in defense, space or homeland security spending by U.S. and/orforeign customers could reduce our revenues.        In fiscal 2007, approximately 41% of the sales of our ElectronicTechnologies Group were derived from the sale of products and services to U.S.and foreign military agencies and their suppliers. A decline in defense, spaceor homeland security budgets or additional restrictions imposed by the U.S.government on sales of products or services to foreign military agencies couldlower sales of our products and services.Intense competition from existing and new competitors may harm our business.        We face significant competition in each of our businesses.     Flight Support Group        o       For jet engine replacement parts, we compete with the industry's                leading jet engine OEMs, particularly Pratt & Whitney and                General Electric.        o       For the overhaul and repair of jet engine and airframe                components as well as avionics and navigation systems, we                compete with:                -       major commercial airlines, many of which operate their                        own maintenance and overhaul units;                -       OEMs, which manufacture, repair, and overhaul their own                        parts; and                -       other independent service companies.    Electronic Technologies Group        o       For the design and manufacture of various types of electronic                and electro-optical equipment as well as high voltage                interconnection devices and high speed interface products, we                compete in a fragmented marketplace with a number of companies,                some of which are well capitalized.        The aviation aftermarket supply industry is highly fragmented, hasseveral highly visible leading companies, and is characterized by intensecompetition. Some of our OEM competitors have greater name recognition thanHEICO, as well as complementary lines of business and financial, marketing, andother resources that HEICO does not have. In addition, OEMs, aircraftmaintenance providers, leasing companies, and FAA-certificated repair facilitiesmay attempt to bundle their services and product offerings in the supplyindustry, thereby significantly increasing industry competition. Moreover, oursmaller competitors may be able to offer more attractive pricing of parts as aresult of lower labor costs or other factors. A variety of potential actions byany of our competitors, including a reduction of product                                       12prices or the establishment by competitors of long-term relationships with newor existing customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business,financial condition, and results of operations. Competition typicallyintensifies during cyclical downturns in the aviation industry, when supply mayexceed demand. We may not be able to continue to compete effectively againstpresent or future competitors, and competitive pressures may have a material andadverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.Our success is dependent on the development and manufacture of new products,equipment, and services. Our inability to develop, manufacture, and introducenew products and services at profitable pricing levels could reduce our sales orsales growth.        The aviation, defense, space, and electronics industries are constantlyundergoing development and change and, accordingly, new products, equipment, andmethods of repair and overhaul service are likely to be introduced in thefuture. In addition to manufacturing electronic and electro-optical equipmentand selected aerospace and defense components for OEMs and the U.S. governmentand repairing jet engine and aircraft components, we re-design sophisticatedaircraft replacement parts originally developed by OEMs so that we can offer thereplacement parts for sale at substantially lower prices than those manufacturedby the OEMs. Consequently, we devote substantial resources to research andproduct development. Technological development poses a number of challenges andrisks, including the following:        o       We may not be able to successfully protect the proprietary                interests we have in various aircraft parts, electronic, and                electro-optical equipment and our repair processes;        o       As OEMs continue to develop and improve jet engines and aircraft                components, we may not be able to re-design and manufacture                replacement parts that perform as well as those offered by OEMs                or we may not be able to profitably sell our replacement parts                at lower prices than the OEMs;        o       We may need to expend significant capital to:                -       purchase new equipment and machines,                -       train employees in new methods of production and                        service, and                -       fund the research and development of new products; and        o       Development by our competitors of patents or methodologies that                preclude us from the design and manufacture of aircraft                replacement parts or electrical and electro-optical equipment                could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and                results of operations.        In addition, we may not be able to successfully develop new products,equipment, or methods of repair and overhaul service, and the failure to do socould have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, andresults of operations.Product specification costs and requirements could cause an increase to ourcosts to complete contracts.        Although our engineering teams have usually successfully foreseencontract completion costs, the costs to meet customer specifications andrequirements could result in us having to spend more to design or manufactureproducts and this could reduce our profit margins on current contracts or thosewe obtain in the future.                                       13We may incur product liability claims that are not fully insured.        Our jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts and repair andoverhaul services expose our business to potential liabilities for personalinjury or death as a result of the failure of an aircraft component that we havedesigned, manufactured, or serviced. The commercial aviation industryoccasionally has catastrophic losses that may exceed policy limits. An uninsuredor partially insured claim, or a claim for which third-party indemnification isnot available, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financialcondition, and results of operations. Additionally, insurance coverage costs maybecome even more expensive in the future. Our customers typically require us tomaintain substantial insurance coverage and our inability to obtain insurancecoverage at commercially reasonable rates could have a material adverse effecton our business.We may not have the administrative, operational, or financial resources tocontinue to grow the company.        We have experienced rapid growth in recent periods and intend tocontinue to pursue an aggressive growth strategy, both through acquisitions andinternal expansion of products and services. Our growth to date has placed, andcould continue to place, significant demands on our administrative, operational,and financial resources. We may not be able to grow effectively or manage ourgrowth successfully, and the failure to do so could have a material adverseeffect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.We may not be able to execute our acquisition strategy, which could slow ourgrowth.        A key element of our strategy is growth through the acquisition ofadditional companies. Our acquisition strategy is affected by and poses a numberof challenges and risks, including the following:        o       Availability of suitable acquisition candidates;        o       Availability of capital;        o       Diversion of management's attention;        o       Integration of the operations and personnel of acquired                companies;        o       Potential write downs of acquired intangible assets;        o       Potential loss of key employees of acquired companies;        o       Use of a significant portion of our available cash;        o       Significant dilution to our shareholders for acquisitions made                utilizing our securities; and        o       Consummation of acquisitions on satisfactory terms.        We may not be able to successfully execute our acquisition strategy, andthe failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business,financial condition, and results of operations.We may incur environmental liabilities and these liabilities may not be coveredby insurance.        Our operations and facilities are subject to a number of federal, state,and local environmental laws and regulations, which govern, among other things,the discharge of hazardous materials into the air and water as well as thehandling, storage, and disposal of hazardous materials. Pursuant to variousenvironmental laws, a current or previous owner or operator of real property maybe liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous materials.Environmental laws typically impose liability whether or not the owner oroperator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous materials.Although                                       14management believes that our operations and facilities are in materialcompliance with environmental laws and regulations, future changes in them orinterpretations thereof or the nature of our operations may require us to makesignificant additional capital expenditures to ensure compliance in the future.        We do not maintain specific environmental liability insurance, and theexpenses related to these environmental liabilities, if we are required to paythem, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition,and results of operations.We are dependent on key personnel and the loss of these key personnel could havea material adverse effect on our success.        Our success substantially depends on the performance, contributions, andexpertise of our senior management team led by Laurans A. Mendelson, ourChairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer. Technical employees are alsocritical to our research and product development, as well as our ability tocontinue to re-design sophisticated products of OEMs in order to sell competingreplacement parts at substantially lower prices than those manufactured by theOEMs. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other keyemployees or our inability to continue to attract or retain the necessarypersonnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, financialcondition, and results of operations.Our executive officers and directors have significant influence over ourmanagement and direction.        As of January 22, 2007, collectively our executive officers and entitiescontrolled by them, our 401(k) Plan, and members of the Board of Directorsbeneficially owned approximately 35% of our outstanding Common Stock andapproximately 9% of our outstanding Class A Common Stock. Accordingly, they willbe able to substantially influence the election of the Board of Directors andcontrol our business, policies, and affairs, including our position with respectto proposed business combinations and attempted takeovers"
7,HEI,HEICO CORP,2007-01-12,"ITEM 1A.   RISK FACTORS         Our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flowscan be impacted by a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control,including but not limited to those set forth below and elsewhere in this AnnualReport on Form 10-K, any one of which may cause our actual results to differmaterially from anticipated results:OUR SUCCESS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE PERFORMANCE OF THE AVIATION INDUSTRY,WHICH COULD BE IMPACTED BY LOWER DEMAND FOR COMMERCIAL AIR TRAVEL OR AIRLINEFLEET CHANGES CAUSING LOWER DEMAND FOR OUR GOODS AND SERVICES.         Economic factors and passenger security concerns that affect theaviation industry also affect our business. The aviation industry hashistorically been subject to downward cycles from time to time which reduce theoverall demand for jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts andrepair and overhaul services, and such downward cycles result in lower pricesand greater credit risk. These economic factors and passenger security concernsmay have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition andresults of operations.WE ARE SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION AND OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESEREGULATIONS COULD CAUSE THE GOVERNMENT TO WITHDRAW OR REVOKE OUR AUTHORIZATIONSAND APPROVALS TO DO BUSINESS AND COULD SUBJECT US TO PENALTIES AND SANCTIONSTHAT COULD HARM OUR BUSINESS.         Governmental agencies throughout the world, including the FAA, highlyregulate the manufacture, repair and overhaul of aircraft parts and accessories.We include with the replacement parts that we sell to our customersdocumentation certifying that each part complies with applicable regulatoryrequirements and meets applicable standards of airworthiness established by theFAA or the equivalent regulatory agencies in other countries. In addition, ourrepair and overhaul operations are subject to                                       11certification pursuant to regulations established by the FAA. Specificregulations vary from country to country, although compliance with FAArequirements generally satisfies regulatory requirements in other countries. Therevocation or suspension of any of our material authorizations or approvalswould have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results ofoperations. New and more stringent government regulations, if adopted andenacted, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition andresults of operations. In addition, some sales to foreign countries of theequipment manufactured by our Electronic Technologies Group require approval orlicensing from the U.S. government. Denial of export licenses could reduce oursales to those countries and could have a material adverse effect on ourbusiness.THE RETIREMENT OF COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT COULD REDUCE OUR REVENUES.         Our Flight Support Group designs, engineers, manufactures anddistributes jet engine and aircraft component replacement parts and also offersrepairs, refurbishments and overhauls of jet engine and aircraft components. Ifaircraft for which we have replacement parts or supply repair and overhaulservices are retired and there are fewer aircraft that require these parts orservices our revenues may decline.REDUCTIONS IN DEFENSE OR SPACE SPENDING BY U.S. AND/OR FOREIGN CUSTOMERS COULDREDUCE OUR REVENUES.         In fiscal 2006, approximately 44% of the sales of our ElectronicTechnologies Group were derived from the sale of products and services to U.S.and foreign military agencies and their suppliers. A decline in defense or spacebudgets or additional restrictions imposed by the U.S. government on sales ofproducts or services to foreign military agencies could lower sales of ourproducts and services.INTENSE COMPETITION FROM EXISTING AND NEW COMPETITORS MAY HARM OUR BUSINESS.
