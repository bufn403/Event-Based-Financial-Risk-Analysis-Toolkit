7,GFF,GRIFFON CORP,2023-11-16,"Risk Factors
 Griffon’s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors which could cause Griffon’s actual results to vary materially from recent or anticipated future results. The risk factors discussed in this section should be carefully considered with all of the information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risk factors should not be considered the only risk factors facing Griffon. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that are currently deemed immaterial may also materially impact Griffon’s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows in the future. In general, Griffon is subject to the same general risks and uncertainties that impact other diverse manufacturing companies including, but not limited to, general economic, industry and/or market conditions and growth rates; impact of natural disasters and pandemics, and their effect on global markets; possible future terrorist threats and their effect on the worldwide economy; and changes in laws or accounting rules. Griffon has identified the following specific risks and uncertainties that it believes have the potential to materially affect its business and financial condition.Risks Related to Our BusinessCurrent worldwide economic uncertainty and market volatility could adversely affect Griffon’s businesses. The current worldwide economic uncertainty and market volatility could continue to have an adverse effect on Griffon during 2024, within both the HBP and CPP segments, which are linked to the U.S. housing and the commercial property markets, and the U.S. economy in general.  Purchases of many HBP and CPP products are discretionary for consumers who are generally more willing to purchase products during periods in which favorable macroeconomic conditions prevail. These conditions 13could make it more difficult to obtain additional credit on favorable terms for investments in current businesses or for acquisitions, or could render financing unavailable; in addition, while we do not have any near term debt maturities, if these conditions persist, we may have difficulty refinancing our debt when it comes due.  Griffon is also exposed to certain fundamental economic risks including a decrease in the demand for the products and services it offers or a higher likelihood of default on its receivables. Adverse trends and general economic conditions, especially those that relate to construction and renovation, will impact Griffon’s business.The HBP and CPP businesses serve residential and commercial construction and renovation, and are influenced by market conditions that affect these industries. For the year ended September 30, 2023, approximately 59% and 41% of Griffon’s consolidated revenue was derived from the HBP and CPP segments, respectively, which were dependent on renovation of existing homes, new home construction, and commercial non-residential construction, repair and replacement. The strength of the U.S. economy, the age of existing home stock, job growth, interest rates, consumer confidence and the availability of consumer credit, as well as demographic factors such as migration into the U.S. and migration of the population within the U.S., have an effect on HBP and CPP.  To the extent market conditions for residential or commercial construction and renovation are weaker than expected, this will likely have an adverse impact on the performance and financial results of the HBP and CPP businesses.Griffon is exposed to fluctuations in inflation, which could negatively affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.Inflation rates, particularly in the United States, increased to historic levels in 2022. Although, according to the U.S. Department of Labor, the annual inflation rate for the United States decreased to 3.7% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, high inflation or increases in inflation may result in decreased demand for Griffon’s operating company’s products and services and increased operating costs and expenses, including for labor, raw materials and supplies. In addition, the United States Federal Reserve has raised, and may continue to raise, interest rates in response to concerns about inflation. Increases in interest rates, especially if coupled with reduced government spending and volatility in financial markets, may have the effect of further increasing economic uncertainty and heightening these risks, which may result in economic recession. As a result of fluctuations in inflation, we may seek to increase the sales prices of our products and services in order to maintain satisfactory margins. Any attempts to offset Griffon’s cost increases with price increases may result in reduced sales, increased customer dissatisfaction or harm to reputation. Additionally, Griffon’s operating companies may be unable to raise the prices of their products and services at or above the rate at which their costs increase, which may reduce operating margins and have a material adverse effect on financial results and future growth. Griffon operates in highly competitive industries and may be unable to compete effectively. Griffon’s operating companies face intense competition in the markets they serve. Griffon competes primarily on the basis of technical expertise, product differentiation, quality of products and services, and price. There are a number of competitors to Griffon, some of which are larger and have greater resources than Griffon’s operating companies. Griffon's operating companies may face additional competition from companies that operate in countries with significantly lower operating costs.  Many HBP and CPP customers are large mass merchandisers, such as home centers, warehouse clubs, discount stores, commercial distributors and e-commerce companies. The growing share of the market represented by these large mass merchandisers, together with changes in consumer shopping patterns, have contributed to the increase of multi-category retailers and e-commerce companies that have strong negotiating power with suppliers. Many of these retailers import products directly from suppliers based in low-cost countries to source and sell products under their own private label brands to compete with HBP and CPP products and brands, which puts increasing price pressure on the products of these businesses. In addition, the intense competition in the retail and e-commerce sectors, combined with the overall increasingly competitive economic environment, may result in a number of customers experiencing financial difficulty, or failing in the future. The loss of, or a failure by, one of HBP’s or CPP’s significant customers could adversely impact our sales and operating cash flows.To address all of these challenges, HBP and CPP must be able to respond to these competitive pressures, and the failure to respond effectively could result in a loss of sales, reduced profitability and a limited ability to recover cost increases through price increases. In addition, there can be no assurance that Griffon will not encounter increased competition in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on Griffon’s financial results.14The loss of large customers can harm financial results. A small number of customers account for, and are expected to continue to account for, a substantial portion of Griffon's consolidated revenue.  Home Depot and Menards are significant customers of HBP and Home Depot, Lowe’s and Bunnings are significant customers of CPP.  Home Depot accounted for approximately 12% of consolidated revenue, 9% of HBP's revenue and 15% of CPP's revenue for the year ended September 30, 2023.  Future operating results will continue to substantially depend on the success of Griffon’s largest customers, as well as Griffon’s relationships with them. Orders from these customers are subject to fluctuation and may be reduced materially due to changes in customer needs or other factors. Any reduction or delay in sales of products to one or more of these customers could significantly reduce Griffon’s revenue. Griffon’s operating results will also depend on successfully developing relationships with additional key customers. Griffon cannot assure that its largest customers will be retained or that additional key customers will be recruited. Also, both HBP and CPP extend credit to its customers, which exposes it to credit risk.  The largest customer accounted for approximately 7%, 19% and 13% of the net accounts receivable of HBP, CPP and Griffon as of September 30, 2023, respectively. If this customer were to become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay its debts, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of HBP, CPP and Griffon could be adversely affected.Reliance on third party suppliers and manufacturers may impair the ability of HBP and CPP to meet their customer demands. HBP and CPP rely on a limited number of companies globally to supply components and manufacture certain of their products. The percentage of HBP and CPP worldwide sourced finished goods as a percent of revenue approximated 5% and 27%, respectively, in 2023. The percentage of HBP and CPP's worldwide sourced components as a percent of cost of goods sold approximated 20% and 4%, respectively, in 2023. Reliance on third party suppliers and manufacturers may reduce control over the timing of deliveries and quality of both HBP and CPP products. Reduced product quality or failure to deliver products timely may jeopardize relationships with certain of HBP's and CPP's key customers. In addition, reliance on third party suppliers or manufacturers may result in the failure to meet HBP and CPP customer demands. Continued turbulence in the worldwide economy may affect the liquidity and financial condition of HBP and CPP suppliers. Should any of these parties fail to manufacture sufficient supply, go out of business or discontinue a particular component, alternative suppliers may not be found in a timely manner, if at all. Such events may impact the ability of HBP and CPP to fill orders, which could have a material adverse effect on customer relationships.In May 2023, in response to changing market conditions, Griffon announced that CPP will expand its global sourcing strategy. This will increase CPP’s reliance on third-party suppliers and therefore is likely to increase CPP’s exposure to the risks relating to the use of third-party suppliers.  See the risk below titled “The expansion of CPP’s global sourcing strategy may not achieve its intended results.” If Griffon is unable to obtain raw materials for products at favorable prices it could adversely impact operating performance. HBP and CPP suppliers primarily provide resin, wood, steel and wire rod.  Both of these businesses could experience shortages of raw materials or components for products or be forced to seek alternative sources of supply. If temporary shortages due to disruptions in supply caused by weather, transportation, production delays or other factors require raw materials to be secured from sources other than current suppliers, the terms may not be as favorable as current terms or certain materials may not be available at all. In recent years, both HBP and CPP have experienced price increases for most of their raw materials. While most key raw materials used in Griffon’s businesses are generally available from numerous sources, raw materials are subject to price fluctuations. Because raw materials in the aggregate constitute a significant component of the cost of goods sold, price fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on Griffon’s results of operations. Griffon’s ability to pass raw material price increases to customers is limited due to supply arrangements and competitive pricing pressure, and there is generally a time lag between increased raw material costs and implementation of corresponding price increases for Griffon’s products. In particular, sharp increases in raw material prices are more difficult to pass through to customers and may negatively affect short-term financial performance.CPP is subject to risks from sourcing from international locations, especially ChinaCPP's business is global, with products and raw materials sourced from, and manufactured and sold in multiple countries around the world. There are risks associated with conducting a business that may be impacted by political and other developments associated with international trade. In this regard, certain products sold by CPP in the United States and elsewhere are currently sourced from suppliers in China, with some of these products sourced exclusively from suppliers in China. Certain raw materials used by CPP may be sourced from China and therefore may have their prices and availability impacted by tariffs imposed on trade between the United States and China.  As it executes its expanded sourcing strategy and 15closes numerous U.S. facilities, CPP may increase its reliance on suppliers in China, which could further impact pricing and tariffs.The sourcing of CPP finished goods, components and raw materials from China are generally subject to supply agreements with Chinese companies. China does not have a well-developed, consolidated body of laws governing agreements with international customers. Enforcement of existing laws or contracts based on existing law may be uncertain and sporadic, and it may be difficult to obtain swift and equitable enforcement or to obtain enforcement of a judgment by a court of another jurisdiction, including other jurisdictions within China itself.  The relatively limited Chinese judicial precedent on matters of international trade in many cases creates additional uncertainty as to the outcome of any litigation. In addition, interpretation of statutes and regulations in China may be subject to government policies or political changes.Because of the volume of sourcing by CPP from China, the ongoing trade dispute between the U.S. and China, including the imposition of tariffs on various Chinese imports into the U.S. at various times since March 2018, represents a continuing risk to CPP revenue and operating performance. The tariffs currently apply to approximately 66% of U.S. imports from China, or more than $330 billion of trade. Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 requires that the duties must terminate after four years unless one or more domestic beneficiaries of the tariffs requests their continuation. In September 2022, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) announced that it had received such requests and would therefore continue the tariffs pending a comprehensive review of their necessity.  As of September 30, 2023 the four-year review remains ongoing. In September the USTR announced an extension of certain exclusions from the tariffs through December 31, 2023 to allow the USTR to complete its review.  It remains unknown whether the USTR will continue the Section 301 tariffs upon completion of its review. In addition to tariffs, an increased global focus on forced labor in supply chains has the potential to impact our business operations. In June 2022, the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) went into effect and establishes a rebuttable presumption that goods made in whole or in part in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of the People’s Republic of China are produced with forced labor, and directs US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to prevent entry of products made with forced labor into the U.S. market. Importers whose shipments are detained by CBP under the UFLPA can rebut the presumption with “clear and convincing evidence” that the products were not produced with forced labor. This requires that the importer submit detailed information regarding every supplier and sub-supplier, as well as all components and raw materials, relating to the goods being detained, and detention costs accrue during the pendency of CBP’s evaluation. From October 1, 2022 through September 30, 2023, more than 4,000 shipments to U.S importers, valued at approximately $1.4 billion, were targeted by CBP for further inspection. Neither CPP nor its suppliers currently manufacture or source products, components or raw materials from the Uyghur region of China; however, CBP takes a broad approach when targeting shipments it believes may have originated from the Uyghur region based on product definitions, tariff codes and supplier names that lead them to suspect the goods come from the Uyghur region. Additionally, the Forced Labor Enforcement Task Force has determined that certain industry sectors (including apparel, cotton and cotton products, and silica-based products) have an inherently higher risk of forced labor, such that CBP may detain goods suspected of being manufactured with materials originating from Xinjiang, regardless of their declared country of origin.  As a result, CPP shipments may be targeted for detention in which case they become subject to the rebuttable presumption that they were sourced from the Uyghur region even though they are not imported directly from China or are otherwise demonstrably outside the scope of the UFLPA. In view of the increased enforcement of forced labor initiatives, we are continuing to update our compliance measures and work with our supply base to validate their supply chains, from raw materials through components to finished goods, to ensure our goods are not made using forced labor. We cannot be certain that our products will not be targeted or that our shipments will not be detained, which may impact our operating performance. Forced labor enforcement initiatives are also targeting imports from other countries besides China, and we will continue to monitor the products and countries subject to increased scrutiny for potential impacts to our operations.The continuing political and economic conflicts between U.S. and China have resulted in, and may continue to result in retaliatory actions from, both countries, and it is unknown whether current US-China relations over Taiwan, including the signature of the US-Taiwan Initiative on 21st Century Trade signed in May 2023, will impact the ongoing trade dispute with China. We cannot predict what new retaliatory policies and regulations may be implemented by the Chinese government in response to the U.S./Taiwan engagement, and any such policies and regulations or other responses may adversely affect our business operations in China.HBP and CPP operations are also subject to the effects of international trade agreements and regulations such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), and the activities and regulations of the World Trade Organization. Although these trade agreements generally have positive effects on trade liberalization, sourcing flexibility and the cost of goods by 16reducing or eliminating the duties and/or quotas assessed on products manufactured in a particular country, trade agreements can also adversely affect HBP and CPP. For example, trade agreements can result in setting quotas on products that may be imported from a particular country into key markets including the U.S., Canada, Australia and the U.K., or may make it easier for other companies to compete by eliminating restrictions on products from countries in which HBP and CPP competitors source products. With the expansion of its global sourcing strategy and the closure of numerous US manufacturing locations, CPP is likely to experience a diminished ability to take advantage of the trade benefits of the USMCA.The ability of HBP and CPP to import products in a timely and cost-effective manner may continue to be affected by conditions at ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers, such as port and shipping capacity, fuel prices, labor disputes, severe weather or increased homeland security requirements in the U.S. and other countries, as well as the potential for increased costs due to currency exchange fluctuations. These issues, along with the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine, could delay importation of products or require HBP and CPP to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to customers. These alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher transit costs, which could have an adverse impact on the business and financial results of HBP and CPP.The expansion of CPP’s global sourcing strategy may not achieve its intended results.On May 3, 2023, in response to changing market conditions, Griffon announced that its CPP segment will expand its global sourcing strategy to include long handled tools, material handling, and wood storage and organization product lines.  This expansion of CPP’s global sourcing strategy will increase Griffon’s exposure to certain other risks to which it is subject, including those related to the procurement of products from third party suppliers, many of whom are located in China and other non U.S. jurisdictions.  Griffon will also be subject to unique risks associated with the implementation of CPP’s expanded global sourcing strategy, including potential negative effects relating to the closing of domestic manufacturing facilities and the related termination of employees.  There is a risk that CPP’s ability to provide products to its customers will be disrupted as CPP increases its reliance on third party suppliers and expands its distribution system for products manufactured by third parties. CPP may also not realize the proceeds it expects from the sale of facilities that will no longer be used by CPP.CPP’s expanded global sourcing strategy may also increase its exposure to cybersecurity risks, as discussed in the below risk factor titled “Griffon’s operations and reputation may be adversely impacted if our information technology (IT) systems, or the IT systems of third parties with whom we do business, fail to perform adequately or if we or such third parties are the subject of a data breach or cyber-attack.""CPP’s expanded global sourcing strategy is designed to better position CPP to serve customers with a more flexible and cost-effective sourcing model that leverages supplier relationships around the world, which is in turn expected to improve CPP’s competitive positioning and financial performance. There is no guarantee that the restructuring will achieve these intended results.The COVID-19 outbreak, or any other future pandemic, could adversely impact our results of operations.On May 11, 2023, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services declared the end of the Public Health Emergency for COVID-19; however, the effects of COVID-19 continue to linger throughout the global economy and our businesses. Though the severity of COVID-19 has subsided, new variants or any other future pandemic could interrupt business, cause renewed labor and supply chain disruptions, and negatively impact the global and US economy, which could materially and adversely impact our businesses. During the height of COVID-19 our supply chain experienced certain disruptions which, together with other factors such as a shortage of labor, resulted in longer delivery lead times and restricted manufacturing capacity for certain of our products. While our supply chain appears to generally be stable at this time, should a resurgence of COVID-19 occur, our supply chain could again be negatively impacted; for example, certain of our suppliers could be required by government authorities to temporarily cease operations or might be limited in their production capacity. If as a result of a resurgence of COVID-19 or the outbreak of a new pandemic, governments take protective actions, it may have a material adverse impact on Griffon’s businesses and operating results for the reasons described above. In such event, the extent and duration of any impact on our businesses would be difficult to predict. To the extent such resurgence or new outbreak adversely affects our businesses, operations, financial condition and operating results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks factors such as those relating to our high level of indebtedness, our need to generate sufficient cash flows to service our indebtedness, and our ability to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that govern our indebtedness, as described in more detail below.17Griffon’s businesses are subject to seasonal variations and the impact of uncertain weather patterns.HBP’s business is driven by renovation and construction during warm weather, which is historically at reduced levels during the winter months, generally in our second quarter.  In 2023,  54% of CPP's' sales occurred during the second and third quarters compared to 58%  in 2022 and 53% in 2021.  Demand for lawn and garden products is influenced by weather, particularly weekend weather during the peak gardening season. AMES' sales volumes could be adversely affected by certain weather patterns such as unseasonably cool or warm temperatures, hurricanes, water shortages or floods. In addition, lack of snow or lower than average snowfall during the winter season may result in reduced sales of certain AMES' products such as snow shovels and other snow tools. As a result, AMES' results of operations, financial results and cash flows could be adversely impacted.Unionized employees could strike or participate in a work stoppage. At September 30, 2023, Griffon employed approximately 5,700 people on a full-time basis, approximately 4% of whom are covered by collective bargaining or similar labor agreements. If unionized employees engage in a strike or other work stoppage, or if Griffon is unable to negotiate acceptable extensions of agreements with labor unions, a significant disruption of operations and increased operating costs could occur. In addition, any renegotiation or renewal of labor agreements could result in higher wages or benefits paid to unionized employees, which could increase operating costs and as a result have a material adverse effect on profitability.  As a result of the expansion of CPP’s global sourcing strategy, CPP is closing a number of its U.S. facilities, some of which employ union workers; accordingly, the number of Griffon employees that belong to a union will decrease. Griffon’s operations and reputation may be adversely impacted if our information technology (IT) systems, or the IT systems of third parties with whom we do business, fail to perform adequately or if we or such third parties are the subject of a data breach or cyber-attack.We rely on IT systems, networks and services to conduct our business, including communicating with employees and our key commercial customers, ordering and managing materials and products from suppliers, shipping products to customers and analyzing and reporting results of operations. While we have taken steps to ensure the security of our information technology systems, our systems may nevertheless be vulnerable to computer viruses, security breaches and other disruptions from unauthorized users. Cyber criminals are becoming more sophisticated and knowledgeable every day, and as their tactics evolve, it is a constant challenge to ensure that our IT security practices are sufficient to protect our IT systems and data. If our IT systems are damaged or cease to function properly for an extended period of time, whether as a result of a significant cyber incident or otherwise, our ability to communicate internally as well as with our customers and suppliers could be significantly impaired, which may adversely impact our business, operations and reputation.In the normal course of our business, we collect, store, and transmit proprietary and confidential information regarding our brands, customers, employees, suppliers and others. We also engage third parties that store, process and transmit these types of information, as well as personal information, on our behalf. An operational failure or breach of security from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats could lead to loss, misuse or unauthorized disclosure of this information about our employees or customers, which may result in regulatory or other legal proceedings, and could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation. We also may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks. Any such attacks or precautionary measures taken to prevent anticipated attacks may result in increasing costs, including costs for additional technologies, training, and third-party consultants. The losses incurred from a breach of data security and operational failures as well as the precautionary measures required to address this evolving risk may adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We depend on our information systems to process orders, manage inventory and accounts receivable collections,  purchase, sell, and ship products efficiently and on a timely basis, maintain cost-effective operations, and provide superior service to our customers. If these systems are damaged, infiltrated, shutdown, or cease to function properly (whether by planned upgrades, force majeure, telecommunications failures, hardware or software break-ins or viruses, other cyber security incidents, or otherwise), we may suffer disruption in our ability to manage and operate our business.There can be no assurance that the precautions which we have taken against certain events that could disrupt the operations of our IT systems will prevent the occurrence of such a disruption. Any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 18Griffon may be unable to implement its acquisition growth strategy, which may result in added expenses without a commensurate increase in revenue and income, and divert management’s attention.Making strategic acquisitions is a significant part of Griffon’s growth plans. The ability to successfully complete acquisitions depends on identifying and acquiring, on acceptable terms, companies that either complement or enhance currently held businesses or expand Griffon into new profitable businesses, and, for certain acquisitions, obtaining financing on acceptable terms. Additionally, Griffon must properly integrate acquired businesses in order to maximize profitability. The competition for acquisition candidates is intense and Griffon cannot assure that it will successfully identify acquisition candidates and complete acquisitions at reasonable purchase prices, in a timely manner, or at all. Further, there is a risk that acquisitions will not be properly integrated into Griffon’s existing structure. Griffon closed the acquisition of Hunter Fan, its largest acquisition ever, in January 2022; the integration of Hunter Fan with CPP is ongoing.  In the past, Griffon has consummated a group of acquisitions within a short time period, which could occur again; the risks relating to integration of an acquisition may be exacerbated when numerous acquisitions are consummated in a short time period.In implementing an acquisition growth strategy, the following may be encountered:•Costs associated with incomplete or poorly implemented acquisitions;•Expenses, delays and difficulties of integrating acquired companies into Griffon’s existing organization;•Dilution of the interest of existing stockholders;•Diversion of management’s attention; or•Difficulty in obtaining financing on acceptable terms, or at all.An unsuccessful implementation of Griffon’s acquisition growth strategy, including the failure to properly integrate acquisitions, could have an adverse impact on Griffon’s results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. We may also incur debt or assume contingent liabilities in connection with acquisitions, which could impose restrictions on our business operations and harm our operating results.Risks Related to Our IndebtednessGriffon’s senior notes, which have limited covenants, are not due until 2028; its $800 million Term Loan B (current balance of $463 million), which also has limited covenants, is not due until 2029; and its $500 million revolving line of credit, which has greater covenant requirements, does not mature until 2028. However, in the event the 2028 Senior Notes are not repaid, refinanced, or replaced prior to December 1, 2027, the Revolver will mature on December 1, 2027.  There are potential impacts from Griffon’s use of debt to finance certain of its activities, especially acquisitions and expansions, as set forth below.Compliance with restrictions and covenants in Griffon’s debt agreements may limit its ability to take corporate actions.The credit agreement entered into by, and, to a lesser extent, the terms of the senior notes issued by, Griffon each contain covenants that restrict the ability of Griffon and its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional debt, pay dividends, incur liens and make investments, acquisitions, dispositions, restricted payments and capital expenditures. Under the credit agreement, Griffon is also required to comply with specific financial ratios and tests. Griffon may not be able to comply in the future with these covenants or restrictions as a result of events beyond its control, such as prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions or a change in control of Griffon. If Griffon defaults in maintaining compliance with the covenants and restrictions in its credit agreement or the senior notes, its lenders could declare all of the principal and interest amounts outstanding due and payable and, in the case of the credit agreement, terminate the commitments to extend credit to Griffon in the future. If Griffon or its subsidiaries are unable to secure credit in the future, its business could be harmed.Griffon may be unable to raise additional financing if needed.Griffon may need to raise additional financing in the future in order to implement its business plan, refinance debt, or acquire new or complimentary businesses or assets. Any required additional financing may be unavailable, or only available at unfavorable terms, due to uncertainties in the credit markets. If Griffon raises additional funds by issuing equity securities, current holders of its common stock may experience significant ownership interest dilution and the holders of the new securities may have rights senior to the rights associated with current outstanding common stock.19Griffon’s indebtedness and interest expense could limit cash flow and adversely affect operations and Griffon’s ability to make full payment on outstanding debt.Griffon’s indebtedness poses potential risks such as:•A substantial portion of cash flows from operations could be used to pay principal and interest on debt, thereby reducing the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, product development and other general corporate purposes;•Insufficient cash flows from operations may force Griffon to sell assets, or seek additional capital, which Griffon may not be able to secure on favorable terms, if at all; and•Its level of indebtedness may make Griffon more vulnerable to economic or industry downturns.Risk Related to Our Common StockGriffon has the ability to issue additional equity securities, which would lead to dilution of issued and outstanding common stock.The issuance of additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities would result in dilution to existing stockholders’ equity interests. Griffon is authorized to issue, without stockholder vote or approval, 3,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series, and has the ability to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of any such series. Any such series of preferred stock could contain dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices, liquidation preferences or other rights superior to the rights of holders of Griffon’s common stock.  While there is no present intention of issuing any such preferred stock, Griffon reserves the right to do so at any time. In addition, Griffon is authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, up to 85,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 53,062,352 shares, net of treasury shares, were outstanding as of September 30, 2023. Additionally, Griffon is authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, securities convertible into either shares of common stock or preferred stock.General Risk Factors
Each of Griffon's businesses faces risks related to the disruption of its primary manufacturing facilities.The manufacturing facilities for each of Griffon's businesses are concentrated in just a few locations, and in the case of CPP, some of these locations are abroad in low-cost locations. Any of Griffon's manufacturing facilities are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, such as natural or man-made disasters, pandemics, terrorist activities, disruptions of information technology resources, and utility interruptions. Such disruptions may cause delays in shipping products, which could result in the loss of business or customer trust, adversely affecting Griffon’s businesses and operating results.Manufacturing capacity constraints or increased manufacturing costs may have a material adverse effect on Griffon's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Griffon’s current manufacturing resources may be inadequate to meet significantly increased demand for some of its products. Griffon’s ability to increase its manufacturing capacity depends on many factors, including the availability of capital, steadily increasing consumer demand, equipment delivery, construction lead-times, installation, qualification, and permitting and other regulatory requirements. Increasing capacity through the use of third-party manufacturers may depend on Griffon’s ability to develop and maintain such relationships and the ability of such third parties to devote additional capacity to fill its orders.A lack of sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand could cause customer service levels to decrease, which may negatively affect customer demand for Griffon's products and customer relations generally, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on Griffon's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, operating facilities at or near capacity may also increase production and distribution costs and negatively impact relations with employees or contractors, which could result in disruptions to operations.In addition, manufacturing costs may increase significantly and Griffon may not be able to pass along all or any of such increase to its customers; and when such increases are passed off to customers, there will be a time lag, which may be significant. 20If HBP and CPP do not continue to develop and maintain leading brands or realize the anticipated benefits of advertising and promotion spend, its operating results may suffer.The ability of HBP and CPP to compete successfully depends in part on the company’s ability to develop and maintain leading brands so that retail and other customers will need its products to meet consumer demand. Leading brands allow both CPP and HBP to realize economies of scale in its operations. The development and maintenance of such brands require significant investment in brand-building and marketing initiatives. While HBP and CPP plan to continue to increase its expenditures for advertising and promotion and other brand-building and marketing initiatives over the long term, the initiatives may not deliver the anticipated results and the results of such initiatives may not cover the costs of the increased investment. Griffon may be required to record impairment charges for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Griffon is required to assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually for impairment or on an interim basis if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest impairment exists. If impairment testing indicates that the carrying amount of reporting units or indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds the respective fair value, an impairment charge would be recognized. If goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets were to become impaired, the results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023, we also recorded a non-cash, pre-tax indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment of $109,200. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, we recorded a non-cash, pre-tax indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment of $175,000 and a non-cash, pre-tax goodwill impairment of $342,027.  These non-cash impairments resulted in an aggregate decrease of $1.49 and $8.43 in our earnings per share for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Should we have to record additional impairment charges in the future, it could similarly have a significant negative impact on our earnings per share for the year in which any such impairment charge is recorded.If Griffon's subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform their obligations, Griffon's performance and ability to win future business could be harmed.Griffon relies on other companies to provide materials, major components and products to fulfill contractual obligations. Such arrangements may involve subcontracts, teaming arrangements, or supply agreements with other companies. There is a risk that Griffon may have disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed. In addition, changes in the economic environment, including constraints on available financing, may adversely affect the financial stability of Griffon's supply chain and their ability to meet their performance requirements or to provide needed supplies on a timely basis. A disruption or failure of any supplier could have an adverse effect on Griffon's business resulting in an impact to profitability, possible termination of a contract, imposition of fines or penalties, and harm to Griffon's reputation impacting its ability to secure future business.Griffon’s companies must continually improve existing products, design and sell new products and invest in research and development in order to compete effectively. The markets for Griffon’s products are characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and continuous improvements in products. Due to constant changes in Griffon's markets, future success depends on Griffon's ability to develop new technologies, products, processes and product applications.  Griffon's long-term success in the competitive retail environment and the industrial and commercial markets depends on its ability to develop and commercialize a continuing stream of innovative new products that are appealing to ultimate end users and create demand. New product development and commercialization efforts, including efforts to enter markets or product categories in which Griffon has limited or no prior experience, have inherent risks. These risks include the costs involved, such as development and commercialization, product development or launch delays, and the failure of new products and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance or growth in sales or operating income.Griffon also faces the risk that its competitors will introduce innovative new products that compete with Griffon’s products.  In addition, sales generated by new products could cause a decline in sales of Griffon’s other existing products. If new product development and commercialization efforts are not successful, Griffon’s financial results could be adversely affected.21Product and technological developments are accomplished both through internally-funded R&D projects, as well as through strategic partnerships with customers. Because it is not generally possible to predict the amount of time required and costs involved in achieving certain R&D objectives, actual development costs may exceed budgeted amounts and estimated product development schedules may be extended. Griffon’s financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if: •Product improvements are not completed on a timely basis;•New products are not introduced on a timely basis or do not achieve sufficient market penetration;•There are budget overruns or delays in R&D efforts; or•New products experience reliability or quality problems, or otherwise do not meet customer preferences or requirements. The loss of certain key officers or employees could adversely affect Griffon’s business. The success of Griffon is materially dependent upon the continued services of certain key officers and employees. The loss of such key personnel could have a material adverse effect on Griffon’s operating results or financial condition. Griffon is exposed to a variety of risks relating to non-U.S. sales and operations, including non-U.S. economic and political conditions and fluctuations in exchange rates.Griffon and its companies conduct operations in Canada, Australasia, the U.K., and China, and sell their products in many countries around the world. Sales of products through non-U.S. subsidiaries accounted for approximately 15% of consolidated revenue for the year ended September 30, 2023. These sales could be adversely affected by changes in political and economic conditions, trade protection measures, such as tariffs, the ability of the Company to enter into industrial cooperation agreements (offset agreements), differing intellectual property rights and laws and changes in regulatory requirements that restrict the sales of products or increase costs in such locations. Enforcement of existing laws in such jurisdictions can be uncertain, and the lack of a sophisticated body of laws can create various uncertainties, including with respect to customer and supplier contracts. Currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in the non-U.S. regions in which Griffon does business may also have an impact on future reported financial results.Griffon's international sales and operations are subject to applicable laws relating to trade, export controls and foreign corrupt practices, the violation of which could adversely affect operations. Griffon is subject to various anti-corruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. In addition, Griffon is subject to certain export controls, laws and regulations, as well as to economic sanctions, laws and embargoes imposed by various governments or organizations, including the U.S. and the European Union or member countries. Violations of anti-corruption, export controls or sanctions laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties, including loss of export privileges and loss of authorizations needed to conduct Griffon's international business. Such violations could also result in Griffon being subject to other liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on Griffon's business, results of operations and financial condition.Griffon may not be able to protect its proprietary rights. Griffon relies on a combination of patent, copyright and trademark laws, common law, trade secrets, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions to protect proprietary rights. Such measures do not provide absolute protection and Griffon cannot give assurance that measures for protecting these proprietary rights are and will be adequate, or that competitors will not independently develop similar technologies. Griffon or its suppliers may inadvertently infringe on, or may be accused of infringing on, proprietary rights of others.Griffon is regularly improving its technology and employing existing technologies in new ways. Though Griffon takes reasonable precautions to ensure it does not infringe on the rights of others, it is possible that Griffon may inadvertently infringe on, or be accused of infringing on, proprietary rights held by others. If Griffon is found to have infringed on the propriety rights held by others, any related litigation or settlement relating to such infringement may have a material effect on Griffon’s business, results of operations and financial condition.It is also possible that Griffon’s suppliers may inadvertently infringe on, or be accused of infringing on, proprietary rights held by others. Any such infringement (or alleged infringement) may have a material adverse effect on Griffon’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, in the past, a supplier may not be able to develop an alternative design that 22meets Griffon’s needs at a comparable cost or at all, and the supply of certain products or components to Griffon may be interrupted. Griffon is exposed to product liability and warranty claims. Griffon is subject to product liability and warranty claims in the ordinary course of business, including with respect to former businesses now included within discontinued operations. These claims relate to the conformity of its products with required specifications, and to alleged or actual defects in Griffon’s products (or in end-products in which Griffon’s products were a component part) that cause damage to property or persons. There can be no assurance that the frequency and severity of product liability claims brought against Griffon will not increase, which claims can be brought either by an injured customer of an end product manufacturer who used one of Griffon's products as a component or by a direct purchaser. There is also no assurance that the number and value of warranty claims will not increase as compared to historical claim rates, or that Griffon's warranty reserve at any particular time is sufficient. No assurance can be given that indemnification from customers or coverage under insurance policies will be adequate to cover future product liability claims against Griffon; for example, product liability insurance typically does not cover claims for punitive damages. Warranty claims are typically not covered by insurance at all. Product liability insurance can be expensive, difficult to maintain and may be unobtainable in the future on acceptable terms. The amount and scope of any insurance coverage may be inadequate if a product liability claim is successfully asserted. Furthermore, if any significant claims are made, the business and the related financial condition of Griffon may be adversely affected by negative publicity. Griffon has been, and may in the future be, subject to claims and liabilities under environmental laws and regulations.Griffon’s operations and assets are subject to environmental laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment, the handling and disposal of wastes, including solid and hazardous wastes, and otherwise relating to health, safety and protection of the environment, in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Griffon does not expect to make any expenditure with respect to ongoing compliance with or remediation under these environmental laws and regulations that would have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results or financial condition. However, the applicable requirements under environmental laws and regulations may change at any time. Griffon can incur environmental costs related to sites that are no longer owned or operated, as well as third-party sites to which hazardous materials are sent. Material expenditures or liabilities may be incurred in connection with such claims. See the Commitment and Contingencies footnote in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on environmental contingencies. Based on facts presently known, the outcome of current environmental matters are not expected to have a material adverse effect on Griffon’s results of operations and financial condition. However, presently unknown environmental conditions, changes in environmental laws and regulations or other unanticipated events may give rise to claims that may involve material expenditures or liabilities. Changes in income tax laws and regulations or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect profitability.Griffon is subject to Federal, state and local income taxes in the U.S. and in various taxing jurisdictions outside the U.S. Tax provisions and liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various U.S. and international tax jurisdictions. Griffon’s effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in any valuation allowance for deferred tax assets or the amendment or enactment of tax laws. Further changes in the tax laws could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting project undertaken by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (“OECD”). In December 2022, the European Union (“EU”) member states reached an agreement to implement the minimum tax component (“Pillar Two”) of the OECD’s tax reform initiative. The directive is expected to be enacted into the national law of the EU member states by December 31, 2023. If similar directives under Pillar Two are adopted by taxing authorities in other countries in which we do business, such changes could materially increase the amount of taxes we pay and therefore materially decrease our results of operations and cash flows. The amount of income taxes paid is subject to audits by U.S. Federal, state and local tax authorities, as well as tax authorities in the taxing jurisdictions outside the U.S. If such audits result in assessments different from recorded income tax liabilities, Griffon’s future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to its income tax provision.Actions taken by activist shareholders could be disruptive and costly and may conflict with or disrupt the strategic direction of our business.Similar to the activist shareholder campaign initiated in 2021, activist shareholders may from time to time attempt to effect changes in our strategic direction and seek changes regarding Griffon’s corporate governance or structure. Our Board of Directors and management team strive to maintain constructive, ongoing communications with all shareholders who wish to speak with us, including activist shareholders, and welcomes their views and opinions with the goal of working together 23constructively to enhance value for all shareholders. However, activist campaigns that contest, or conflict with, our strategic direction could have an adverse effect on us because:a.responding to actions by activist shareholders can disrupt our operations, be costly and time consuming, and divert the attention of our Board and senior management from the pursuit of our business strategies, andb.perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may cause (i) instability or lack of continuity, which may be exploited by our competitors, (ii) concern on the part of current or potential customers, (iii) loss of business opportunities, or (iv) difficulties in attracting and retain qualified personnel and business partners.Activist campaigns may also cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions, or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the fundamental underlying value of our businesses"
0,GFF,GRIFFON CORP,2022-11-18,"Risk Factors
 Griffon’s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors which could cause Griffon’s actual results to vary materially from recent or anticipated future results. The risk factors discussed in this section should be carefully considered with all of the information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risk factors should not be considered the only risk factors facing Griffon. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that are currently deemed immaterial may also materially impact Griffon’s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows in the future. In general, Griffon is subject to the same general risks and uncertainties that impact other diverse manufacturing companies including, but not limited to, general economic, industry and/or market conditions and growth rates; impact of natural disasters and pandemics, and their effect on global markets; possible future terrorist threats and their effect on the worldwide economy; and changes in laws or accounting rules. Griffon has identified the following specific risks and uncertainties that it believes have the potential to materially affect its business and financial condition.14Risks Related to Our BusinessCurrent worldwide economic uncertainty and market volatility could adversely affect Griffon’s businesses. The current worldwide economic uncertainty and market volatility could continue to have an adverse effect on Griffon during 2023, within both the CPP and HBP segments, which are linked to the U.S. housing and the commercial property markets, and the U.S. economy in general.   Purchases of many CPP and HBP products are discretionary for consumers who are generally more willing to purchase products during periods in which favorable macroeconomic conditions prevail. These conditions could make it more difficult to obtain additional credit on favorable terms for investments in current businesses or for acquisitions, or could render financing unavailable; in addition, while we do not have any near term debt maturities, if these conditions persist, we may have difficulty refinancing our debt when it comes due.  Griffon is also exposed to certain fundamental economic risks including a decrease in the demand for the products and services it offers or a higher likelihood of default on its receivables. Adverse trends and general economic conditions, especially those that relate to construction and renovation, will impact Griffon’s business.The CPP and HBP businesses serve residential and commercial construction and renovation, and are influenced by market conditions that affect these industries. For the year ended September 30, 2022, approximately 47% and 53% of Griffon’s consolidated revenue was derived from the CPP and HBP segments, respectively, which were dependent on renovation of existing homes, new home construction, and commercial non-residential construction, repair and replacement. The strength of the U.S. economy, the age of existing home stock, job growth, interest rates, consumer confidence and the availability of consumer credit, as well as demographic factors such as migration into the U.S. and migration of the population within the U.S., have an effect on CPP and HBP.  To the extent market conditions for residential or commercial construction and renovation are weaker than expected, this will likely have an adverse impact on the performance and financial results of the CPP and HBP businesses.Griffon is exposed to fluctuations in inflation, which could negatively affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.Inflation rates, including residential mortgage rates, particularly in the United States, have increased recently to historic levels. According to the U.S. Department of Labor, the annual inflation rate for the United States was approximately 8.2% for the twelve months ended September 30, 2022. Continued high inflation or increases in inflation may result in decreased demand for Griffon’s products and services and increased operating costs and expenses, including labor costs and costs of raw materials and supplies. In particular, higher home mortgage rates typically result in a slowdown in both the purchase and construction of new homes and renovation of existing homes, which will reduce demand for certain of Griffon’s products. In addition, the United States Federal Reserve has raised, and may again raise, interest rates in response to concerns about inflation. Increases in interest rates, especially if coupled with reduced government spending and volatility in financial markets, may have the effect of further increasing economic uncertainty and heightening these risks, which may result in economic recession. In the event inflation continues to increase, we may seek to increase the sales prices of our products and services in order to maintain satisfactory margins. Any attempts to offset Griffon’s cost increases with price increases may result in reduced sales, increase customer dissatisfaction or harm to reputation. Additionally, Griffon’s operating companies may be unable to raise the prices of their products and services at or above the rate at which their costs increase, which may reduce revenues and operating margins and have a material adverse effect on financial results and future growth. Griffon operates in highly competitive industries and may be unable to compete effectively. Griffon’s operating companies face intense competition in the markets they serve. Griffon competes primarily on the basis of technical expertise, product differentiation, quality of products and services, and price. There are a number of competitors to Griffon, some of which are larger and have greater resources than Griffon’s operating companies. Griffon's operating companies may face additional competition from companies that operate in countries with significantly lower operating costs.  Many CPP and HBP customers are large mass merchandisers, such as home centers, warehouse clubs, discount stores, commercial distributors and e-commerce companies. The growing share of the market represented by these large mass merchandisers, together with changes in consumer shopping patterns, have contributed to the increase of multi-category retailers and e-commerce companies that have strong negotiating power with suppliers. Many of these retailers import products directly from foreign suppliers to source and sell products under their own private label brands to compete with CPP and HBP products and brands, which puts increasing price pressure on the products of these businesses. In addition, the intense 15competition in the retail and e-commerce sectors, combined with the overall increasingly competitive economic environment, may result in a number of customers experiencing financial difficulty, or failing in the future. The loss of, or a failure by, one of CPP’s or HBP’s significant customers could adversely impact our sales and operating cash flows.To address all of these challenges, CPP and HBP must be able to respond to these competitive pressures, and the failure to respond effectively could result in a loss of sales, reduced profitability and a limited ability to recover cost increases through price increases. In addition, there can be no assurance that Griffon will not encounter increased competition in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on Griffon’s financial results.The loss of large customers can harm financial results. A small number of customers account for, and are expected to continue to account for, a substantial portion of Griffon's consolidated revenue.  Home Depot, Lowe’s and Bunnings are significant customers of CPP, and Home Depot and Menards are significant customers of HBP.  Home Depot accounted for approximately 13% of consolidated revenue, 19% of CPP's revenue and 7% of HBP's revenue for the year ended September 30, 2022.    Future operating results will continue to substantially depend on the success of Griffon’s largest customers, as well as Griffon’s relationships with them. Orders from these customers are subject to fluctuation and may be reduced materially due to changes in customer needs or other factors. Any reduction or delay in sales of products to one or more of these customers could significantly reduce Griffon’s revenue. Griffon’s operating results will also depend on successfully developing relationships with additional key customers. Griffon cannot assure that its largest customers will be retained or that additional key customers will be recruited. Also, both CPP and HBP extend credit to its customers, which exposes it to credit risk.  The largest customer accounted for approximately 26%, 7% and 17% of the net accounts receivable of CPP, HBP and Griffon as of September 30, 2022, respectively. If this customer were to become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay its debts, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of CPP, HBP and Griffon could be adversely affected.Reliance on third party suppliers and manufacturers may impair the ability of CPP and HBP to meet their customer demands. CPP and HBP rely on a limited number of domestic and foreign companies to supply components and manufacture certain of their products. The percentage of CPP and HBP worldwide sourced finished goods as a percent of revenue approximated 34% and 5%, respectively, in 2022. The percentage of CPP and HBP's worldwide sourced components as a percent of cost of goods sold approximated 13% and 14%, respectively, in 2022. Reliance on third party suppliers and manufacturers may reduce control over the timing of deliveries and quality of both CPP and HBP products. Reduced product quality or failure to deliver products timely may jeopardize relationships with certain of CPP's and HBP's key customers. In addition, reliance on third party suppliers or manufacturers may result in the failure to meet CPP and HBP customer demands. Continued turbulence in the worldwide economy may affect the liquidity and financial condition of CPP and HBP suppliers. Should any of these parties fail to manufacture sufficient supply, go out of business or discontinue a particular component, alternative suppliers may not be found in a timely manner, if at all. Such events may impact the ability of CPP and HBP to fill orders, which could have a material adverse effect on customer relationships.A product provided to HBP by one of its suppliers was found to infringe on the intellectual property rights of a competitor of this supplier. The supplier developed an alternative design for such product that has allowed it to meet HBP’s needs and which the supplier believes is non-infringing; however, the competitor has alleged, in a pending administrative proceeding, that the redesigned product also infringes on its intellectual property rights.  The supplier is also appealing the initial finding of infringement and believes it has a reasonable likelihood of success. However, should the alternative design be deemed to be an infringing product and should the supplier lose its appeal of the initial finding of infringement, and as a result the supply of this product is interrupted, it could adversely impact HBP’s business and results of operations. If Griffon is unable to obtain raw materials for products at favorable prices it could adversely impact operating performance. CPP and HBP suppliers primarily provide resin, wood, steel and wire rod.  Both of these businesses could experience shortages of raw materials or components for products or be forced to seek alternative sources of supply. If temporary shortages due to disruptions in supply caused by weather, transportation, production delays or other factors require raw materials to be secured from sources other than current suppliers, the terms may not be as favorable as current terms or certain materials may not be available at all. In recent years, both CPP and HBP have experienced price increases for most of their raw materials. While most key raw materials used in Griffon’s businesses are generally available from numerous sources, raw materials are subject to price fluctuations. Because raw materials in the aggregate constitute a significant component of the cost of goods sold, price fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on Griffon’s results of operations. Griffon’s ability to pass raw material price increases to customers is limited due to supply arrangements and competitive pricing pressure, and there is 16generally a time lag between increased raw material costs and implementation of corresponding price increases for Griffon’s products. In particular, sharp increases in raw material prices are more difficult to pass through to customers and may negatively affect short-term financial performance.CPP is subject to risks from sourcing from international locations, especially ChinaCPP's business is global, with products and raw materials sourced from, manufactured in and sold in multiple countries around the world. There are risks associated with conducting a business that may be impacted by political and other developments associated with international trade. In this regard, certain products sold by CPP in the United States and elsewhere are currently sourced from suppliers in China, with some of these products sourced exclusively from suppliers in China. Certain raw materials used by CPP may be sourced from China and therefore may have their prices and availability impacted by tariffs imposed on trade between the United States and China.The sourcing of CPP finished goods, components and raw materials from China are generally subject to supply agreements with Chinese companies. China does not have a well-developed, consolidated body of laws governing agreements with international customers. Enforcement of existing laws or contracts based on existing law may be uncertain and sporadic, and it may be difficult to obtain swift and equitable enforcement or to obtain enforcement of a judgment by a court of another jurisdiction. The relative limited Chinese judicial precedent on matters of international trade in many cases creates additional uncertainty as to the outcome of any litigation. In addition, interpretation of statutes and regulations in China may be subject to government policies or political changes.Because of the volume of sourcing by CPP from China, the ongoing trade dispute between the U.S. and China, including the imposition of tariffs on various Chinese imports into the U.S. at various times since March 2018, represents a continuing risk to CPP revenue and operating performance. The tariffs currently apply to approximately $375 billion in annual U.S. imports from China. Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 requires that the duties must terminate after four years unless one or more domestic beneficiaries of the tariffs requests their continuation. In September 2022, the United States Trade Representative (USTR) announced that it had received such requests and would therefore continue the tariffs pending a comprehensive review of their necessity. The process for completing this review, which contemplates a period of public comment, means the tariffs will remain in effect for several months at least, with an unpredictable outcome. In addition to tariffs, an increased global focus on forced labor in supply chains has the potential to impact our business operations. In June 2022, the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA) went into effect and establishes a rebuttable presumption that goods made in whole or in part in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of the People’s Republic of China are produced with forced labor, and directs US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) to prevent entry of products made with forced labor into the U.S. market. Importers whose shipments are detained by CBP under the UFLPA can rebut the presumption with “clear and convincing evidence” that the products were not produced with forced labor. This requires that the importer submit detailed information regarding every supplier and sub-supplier, as well as all components and raw materials, relating to the goods being detained, and detention costs accrue during the pendency of CBP’s evaluation. From June 21, 2022 through September 30, 2022, more than 1,450 shipments from China to U.S importers, valued at approximately $429 million, were targeted by CBP for further inspection. Neither CPP nor its suppliers currently manufacture or source products, components or raw materials from the Uyghur region of China; however, CBP takes a broad approach when targeting shipments they believe may have originated from the Uyghur region based on product definitions, tariff codes and supplier names that lead them to suspect the goods come from the Uyghur region. As a result, CPP shipments may be targeted for detention in which case they become subject to the rebuttable presumption that they were sourced from the Uyghur region even though they are demonstrably outside the scope of the UFLPA. In view of the increased enforcement of forced labor initiatives, we are updating our compliance measures and working with our China supply base to validate their supply chains, from raw materials through components to finished goods, to ensure our goods are not made using forced labor. We cannot be certain that our products will not be targeted or that our shipments will not be detained, which may impact our operating performance. Forced labor enforcement initiatives are targeting imports from other countries besides China, and we are monitoring the products and countries subject to increased scrutiny for potential impacts to our operations.The continuing political and economic conflicts between U.S. and China have resulted in and may continue to cause retaliatory policies from both countries, and it is unknown whether current US-China relations over Taiwan, including the commencement of negotiations regarding a new trade initiative between the United States and Taiwan, will impact the ongoing trade dispute with China. We cannot predict what new and additional retaliatory policies and regulations may be implemented by the Chinese government in response to the U.S./Taiwan engagement, and any such policies and regulations or other responses may adversely affect our business operations in China.17CPP and HBP operations are also subject to the effects of international trade agreements and regulations such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, and the activities and regulations of the World Trade Organization. Although these trade agreements generally have positive effects on trade liberalization, sourcing flexibility and cost of goods by reducing or eliminating the duties and/or quotas assessed on products manufactured in a particular country, trade agreements can also adversely affect CPP and HBP businesses. For example, trade agreements can result in setting quotas on products that may be imported from a particular country into key markets including the U.S., Canada, Australia and the U.K., or may make it easier for other companies to compete by eliminating restrictions on products from countries where CPP and HBP competitors source products.The ability of CPP and HBP to import products in a timely and cost-effective manner may continue to be affected by conditions at ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers, such as port and shipping capacity, labor disputes, severe weather or increased homeland security requirements in the U.S. and other countries, as well as the potential for increased costs due to currency exchange fluctuations. These issues could delay importation of products or require CPP and HBP to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to customers. These alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher transit costs, which could have an adverse impact on CPP and HBP business and financial condition. The COVID-19 outbreak, or any other future pandemic could adversely impact our results of operations.The future impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, or any other future pandemic, and the spread of the pathogen on a global basis could adversely affect our businesses in a number of respects, although the extent, nature and timing of such impact cannot be predicted as of the date of this filing. The COVID-19 outbreak led countries around the world, as well as most states in the U.S., to implement restrictions from time-to-time relating to the operation of almost all types of businesses. Most of these restrictions have been eliminated or reduced due to a reduction in the health risk of COVID-19. As of the date of this filing, all of our manufacturing and distribution facilities are operating.  However, government actions taken based on the changing nature of the outbreak in the U.S. or in other countries in which we do business could result in temporary closures of Griffon facilities.During the height of COVID-19 our supply chain experienced certain disruptions which, together with other factors such as a shortage of labor, resulted in longer delivery lead times and restricted manufacturing capacity for certain of our products. While our supply chain appears to generally be stable at this time, should a resurgence of COVID-19 occur, our supply chain could again be negatively impacted; for example, certain of our suppliers could be required by government authorities to temporarily cease operations or might be limited in their production capacity. If as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, including a potential resurgence of the virus in the fall and winter months, governments take additional protective actions, it may have a material adverse impact on Griffon’s businesses and operating results for the reasons described above. In such event, the extent and duration of any impact on our businesses would be difficult to predict. To the extent the COVID-19 outbreak adversely affects our businesses, operations, financial condition and operating results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks factors such as those relating to our high level of indebtedness, our need to generate sufficient cash flows to service our indebtedness, and our ability to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that govern our indebtedness, as described in more detail below.Griffon’s businesses are subject to seasonal variations and the impact of uncertain weather patterns. Griffon's revenue and earnings are generally lowest in our first and fourth quarters ending December 31, and September 30, respectively, and highest in the second and third quarters ending March 31, and June 30, respectively, primarily due to the seasonality within the AMES and HBP businesses.  In 2022, with the addition of Hunter Fan, 58% (55%, excluding Hunter Fan sales) of AMES' sales occurred during the second and third quarters compared to 53% in both 2021 and 2020.  HBP’s business is driven by renovation and construction during warm weather, which is generally at reduced levels during the winter months, generally in our second quarter.Demand for lawn and garden products is influenced by weather, particularly weekend weather during the peak gardening season. AMES' sales volumes could be adversely affected by certain weather patterns such as unseasonably cool or warm temperatures, hurricanes, water shortages or floods. In addition, lack of snow or lower than average snowfall during the winter season may result in reduced sales of certain AMES' products such as snow shovels and other snow tools. As a result, AMES' results of operations, financial results and cash flows could be adversely impacted.18Unionized employees could strike or participate in a work stoppage. At September 30, 2022, Griffon employed approximately 6,200 people on a full-time basis, approximately 4% of whom are covered by collective bargaining or similar labor agreements. If unionized employees engage in a strike or other work stoppage, or if Griffon is unable to negotiate acceptable extensions of agreements with labor unions, a significant disruption of operations and increased operating costs could occur. In addition, any renegotiation or renewal of labor agreements could result in higher wages or benefits paid to unionized employees, which could increase operating costs and as a result have a material adverse effect on profitability. Griffon’s operations and reputation may be adversely impacted if our information technology (IT) systems, or the IT systems of third parties with whom we do business, fail to perform adequately or if we or such third parties are the subject of a data breach or cyber-attack.We rely on IT systems, networks and services to conduct our business, including communicating with employees and our key commercial customers, ordering and managing materials and products from suppliers, shipping products to customers and analyzing and reporting results of operations. While we have taken steps to ensure the security of our information technology systems, our systems may nevertheless be vulnerable to computer viruses, security breaches and other disruptions from unauthorized users. Cyber criminals are becoming more sophisticated and knowledgeable every day, and as their tactics evolve, it is a constant challenge to ensure that our IT security practices are sufficient to protect our IT systems and data. If our IT systems are damaged or cease to function properly for an extended period of time, whether as a result of a significant cyber incident or otherwise, our ability to communicate internally as well as with our customers and suppliers could be significantly impaired, which may adversely impact our business, operations and reputation.In the normal course of our business, we collect, store, and transmit proprietary and confidential information regarding our brands, customers, employees, suppliers and others. We also engage third parties that store, process and transmit these types of information, as well as personal information, on our behalf. An operational failure or breach of security from increasingly sophisticated cyber threats could lead to loss, misuse or unauthorized disclosure of this information about our employees or customers, which may result in regulatory or other legal proceedings, and could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation. We also may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks. Any such attacks or precautionary measures taken to prevent anticipated attacks may result in increasing costs, including costs for additional technologies, training, and third-party consultants. The losses incurred from a breach of data security and operational failures as well as the precautionary measures required to address this evolving risk may adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.We depend on our information systems to process orders, manage inventory and accounts receivable collections,  purchase, sell, and ship products efficiently and on a timely basis, maintain cost-effective operations, and provide superior service to our customers. If these systems are damaged, infiltrated, shutdown, or cease to function properly (whether by planned upgrades, force majeure, telecommunications failures, hardware or software break-ins or viruses, other cyber security incidents, or otherwise), we may suffer disruption in our ability to manage and operate our business.There can be no assurance that the precautions which we have taken against certain events that could disrupt the operations of our information systems will prevent the occurrence of such a disruption. Any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Griffon may be unable to implement its acquisition growth strategy, which may result in added expenses without a commensurate increase in revenue and income, and divert management’s attention.Making strategic acquisitions is a significant part of Griffon’s growth plans. The ability to successfully complete acquisitions depends on identifying and acquiring, on acceptable terms, companies that either complement or enhance currently held businesses or expand Griffon into new profitable businesses, and, for certain acquisitions, obtaining financing on acceptable terms. Additionally, Griffon must properly integrate acquired businesses in order to maximize profitability. The competition for acquisition candidates is intense and Griffon cannot assure that it will successfully identify acquisition candidates and complete acquisitions at reasonable purchase prices, in a timely manner, or at all. Further, there is a risk that acquisitions will not be properly integrated into Griffon’s existing structure. Griffon closed the acquisitions of La Hacienda, Tuscan Path, ClosetMaid and Harper Brush in the months of July through November 2017, Kelkay in February 2018, CornellCookson in June 2018, Apta in November 2019, Quatro in December 2020 and Hunter Fan in January 2022. This integration risk may be exacerbated when numerous acquisitions are consummated in a short time period.19In implementing an acquisition growth strategy, the following may be encountered:•Costs associated with incomplete or poorly implemented acquisitions;•Expenses, delays and difficulties of integrating acquired companies into Griffon’s existing organization;•Dilution of the interest of existing stockholders;•Diversion of management’s attention; or•Difficulty in obtaining financing on acceptable terms, or at all.An unsuccessful implementation of Griffon’s acquisition growth strategy, including the failure to properly integrate acquisitions, could have an adverse impact on Griffon’s results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. We may also incur debt or assume contingent liabilities in connection with acquisitions, which could impose restrictions on our business operations and harm our operating results.The pendency of our current process to explore strategic alternatives and the possible failure to consummate a strategic transaction could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our future business and results of operations.In May 2022, Griffon’s Board of Directors publicly announced that it would explore a comprehensive range of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value including a sale, merger, divestiture, recapitalization or other strategic transaction. This process is active and ongoing. The uncertainties associated with this process, and the expenses and efforts involved, may negatively affect our business and our relationships with employees, customers, suppliers, distributors and vendors. If we do not enter into or consummate a strategic transaction, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Furthermore, if we do not consummate a transaction, the price of our common stock may decline from the current market price, as the current market price might incorporate a market assumption that a transaction will be consummated. A failed transaction may also result in reduced employee morale and productivity, negative publicity and a negative impression of us in the investment community. Further, any disruptions to our business resulting from any announcement and pendency of a transaction, including any adverse changes in our relationships with our customers, suppliers, distributors, vendors and employees or recruiting and retention efforts, could continue or accelerate in the event of a failed acquisition. Matters relating to any failed transaction may require significant costs and expenses and substantial management time and resources, which could otherwise have been devoted to operating and growing our businesses.Risks Related to Our IndebtednessWhile Griffon’s senior notes, which have limited covenants, are not due until 2028; its $800 million Term Loan B (current balance of $496 million), which also has limited covenants, is not due until 2029; and its $400 million revolving line of credit, which has greater covenant requirements, does not mature until 2025, there are potential impacts from Griffon’s use of debt to finance certain of its activities, especially acquisitions and expansions, as set forth below.Compliance with restrictions and covenants in Griffon’s debt agreements may limit its ability to take corporate actions.The credit agreement entered into by, and, to a lesser extent, the terms of the senior notes issued by, Griffon each contain covenants that restrict the ability of Griffon and its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional debt, pay dividends, incur liens and make investments, acquisitions, dispositions, restricted payments and capital expenditures. Under the credit agreement, Griffon is also required to comply with specific financial ratios and tests. Griffon may not be able to comply in the future with these covenants or restrictions as a result of events beyond its control, such as prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions or a change in control of Griffon. If Griffon defaults in maintaining compliance with the covenants and restrictions in its credit agreement or the senior notes, its lenders could declare all of the principal and interest amounts outstanding due and payable and, in the case of the credit agreement, terminate the commitments to extend credit to Griffon in the future. If Griffon or its subsidiaries are unable to secure credit in the future, its business could be harmed.Griffon may be unable to raise additional financing if needed.Griffon may need to raise additional financing in the future in order to implement its business plan, refinance debt, or acquire new or complimentary businesses or assets. Any required additional financing may be unavailable, or only available at unfavorable terms, due to uncertainties in the credit markets. If Griffon raises additional funds by issuing equity securities, current holders of its common stock may experience significant ownership interest dilution and the holders of the new securities may have rights senior to the rights associated with current outstanding common stock.20Griffon’s indebtedness and interest expense could limit cash flow and adversely affect operations and Griffon’s ability to make full payment on outstanding debt.Griffon’s indebtedness poses potential risks such as:•A substantial portion of cash flows from operations could be used to pay principal and interest on debt, thereby reducing the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, product development and other general corporate purposes;•Insufficient cash flows from operations may force Griffon to sell assets, or seek additional capital, which Griffon may not be able to secure on favorable terms, if at all; and•Its level of indebtedness may make Griffon more vulnerable to economic or industry downturns.Risk Related to Our Common StockGriffon has the ability to issue additional equity securities, which would lead to dilution of issued and outstanding common stock.The issuance of additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities would result in dilution to existing stockholders’ equity interests. Griffon is authorized to issue, without stockholder vote or approval, 3,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series, and has the ability to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of any such series. Any such series of preferred stock could contain dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices, liquidation preferences or other rights superior to the rights of holders of Griffon’s common stock.  While there is no present intention of issuing any such preferred stock, Griffon reserves the right to do so at any time. In addition, Griffon is authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, up to 85,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 57,064,331 shares, net of treasury shares, were outstanding as of September 30, 2022. Additionally, Griffon is authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, securities convertible into either shares of common stock or preferred stock.General Risk Factors
Each of Griffon's businesses faces risks related to the disruption of its primary manufacturing facilities.The manufacturing facilities for each of Griffon's businesses are concentrated in just a few locations, and in the case of CPP, some of these locations are abroad in low-cost locations. Any of Griffon's manufacturing facilities are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, such as natural or man-made disasters, pandemics, terrorist activities, disruptions of information technology resources, and utility interruptions. Such disruptions may cause delays in shipping products, which could result in the loss of business or customer trust, adversely affecting Griffon’s businesses and operating results.Manufacturing capacity constraints or increased manufacturing costs may have a material adverse effect on Griffon's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Griffon’s current manufacturing resources may be inadequate to meet significantly increased demand for some of its products. Griffon’s ability to increase its manufacturing capacity depends on many factors, including the availability of capital, steadily increasing consumer demand, equipment delivery, construction lead-times, installation, qualification, and permitting and other regulatory requirements. Increasing capacity through the use of third-party manufacturers may depend on Griffon’s ability to develop and maintain such relationships and the ability of such third parties to devote additional capacity to fill its orders.A lack of sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand could cause customer service levels to decrease, which may negatively affect customer demand for Griffon's products and customer relations generally, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on Griffon's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, operating facilities at or near capacity may also increase production and distribution costs and negatively impact relations with employees or contractors, which could result in disruptions to operations.In addition, manufacturing costs may increase significantly and Griffon may not be able to pass along all or any of such increase to its customers; and when such increases are passed off to customers, there will be a time lag, which may be significant. 21If CPP and HBP do not continue to develop and maintain leading brands or realize the anticipated benefits of advertising and promotion spend, its operating results may suffer.The ability of CPP and HBP to compete successfully depends in part on the company’s ability to develop and maintain leading brands so that retail and other customers will need its products to meet consumer demand. Leading brands allow both CPP and HBP to realize economies of scale in its operations. The development and maintenance of such brands require significant investment in brand-building and marketing initiatives. While CPP and HBP plan to continue to increase its expenditures for advertising and promotion and other brand-building and marketing initiatives over the long term, the initiatives may not deliver the anticipated results and the results of such initiatives may not cover the costs of the increased investment. Griffon may be required to record impairment charges for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. Griffon is required to assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually for impairment or on an interim basis if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest impairment exists. If impairment testing indicates that the carrying amount of reporting units or indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds the respective fair value, an impairment charge would be recognized. If goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets were to become impaired, the results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022, we recorded a non-cash, pre-tax goodwill impairment of $342,027, and a non-cash pre-tax indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment of $175,000. These non-cash impairments resulted in an aggregate decrease of $8.43 in our earnings per share for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2022. Should we have to record additional impairment charges in the future, it could similarly have a significant negative impact on our earnings per share for the year in which any such impairment charge is recorded.If Griffon's subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform their obligations, Griffon's performance and ability to win future business could be harmed.Griffon relies on other companies to provide materials, major components and products to fulfill contractual obligations. Such arrangements may involve subcontracts, teaming arrangements, or supply agreements with other companies. There is a risk that Griffon may have disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed. In addition, changes in the economic environment, including constraints on available financing, may adversely affect the financial stability of Griffon's supply chain and their ability to meet their performance requirements or to provide needed supplies on a timely basis. A disruption or failure of any supplier could have an adverse effect on Griffon's business resulting in an impact to profitability, possible termination of a contract, imposition of fines or penalties, and harm to Griffon's reputation impacting its ability to secure future business.Griffon’s companies must continually improve existing products, design and sell new products and invest in research and development in order to compete effectively. The markets for Griffon’s products are characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and continuous improvements in products. Due to constant changes in Griffon's markets, future success depends on Griffon's ability to develop new technologies, products, processes and product applications.  Griffon's long-term success in the competitive retail environment and the industrial and commercial markets depends on its ability to develop and commercialize a continuing stream of innovative new products that are appealing to ultimate end users and create demand. New product development and commercialization efforts, including efforts to enter markets or product categories in which Griffon has limited or no prior experience, have inherent risks. These risks include the costs involved, such as development and commercialization, product development or launch delays, and the failure of new products and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance or growth in sales or operating income.Griffon also faces the risk that its competitors will introduce innovative new products that compete with Griffon’s products.  In addition, sales generated by new products could cause a decline in sales of Griffon’s other existing products. If new product development and commercialization efforts are not successful, Griffon’s financial results could be adversely affected.22Product and technological developments are accomplished both through internally-funded R&D projects, as well as through strategic partnerships with customers. Because it is not generally possible to predict the amount of time required and costs involved in achieving certain R&D objectives, actual development costs may exceed budgeted amounts and estimated product development schedules may be extended. Griffon’s financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if: •Product improvements are not completed on a timely basis;•New products are not introduced on a timely basis or do not achieve sufficient market penetration;•There are budget overruns or delays in R&D efforts; or•New products experience reliability or quality problems, or otherwise do not meet customer preferences or requirements. The loss of certain key officers or employees could adversely affect Griffon’s business. The success of Griffon is materially dependent upon the continued services of certain key officers and employees. The loss of such key personnel could have a material adverse effect on Griffon’s operating results or financial condition. Griffon is exposed to a variety of risks relating to non-U.S. sales and operations, including non-U.S. economic and political conditions and fluctuations in exchange rates.Griffon and its companies conduct operations in Canada, Australasia, the U.K., and China, and sell their products in many countries around the world. Sales of products through non-U.S. subsidiaries accounted for approximately 17% of consolidated revenue for the year ended September 30, 2022. These sales could be adversely affected by changes in political and economic conditions, trade protection measures, such as tariffs, the ability of the Company to enter into industrial cooperation agreements (offset agreements), differing intellectual property rights and laws and changes in regulatory requirements that restrict the sales of products or increase costs in such locations. Enforcement of existing laws in such jurisdictions can be uncertain, and the lack of a sophisticated body of laws can create various uncertainties, including with respect to customer and supplier contracts. Currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in the non-U.S. regions in which Griffon does business may also have an impact on future reported financial results.Griffon's international sales and operations are subject to applicable laws relating to trade, export controls and foreign corrupt practices, the violation of which could adversely affect operations. Griffon is subject to various anti-corruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. In addition, Griffon is subject to certain export controls, laws and regulations, as well as to economic sanctions, laws and embargoes imposed by various governments or organizations, including the U.S. and the European Union or member countries. Violations of anti-corruption, export controls or sanctions laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties, including loss of export privileges and loss of authorizations needed to conduct Griffon's international business. Such violations could also result in Griffon being subject to other liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on Griffon's business, results of operations and financial condition.Griffon may not be able to protect its proprietary rights. Griffon relies on a combination of patent, copyright and trademark laws, common law, trade secrets, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions to protect proprietary rights. Such measures do not provide absolute protection and Griffon cannot give assurance that measures for protecting these proprietary rights are and will be adequate, or that competitors will not independently develop similar technologies. Griffon or its suppliers may inadvertently infringe on, or may be accused of infringing on, proprietary rights of others.Griffon is regularly improving its technology and employing existing technologies in new ways. Though Griffon takes reasonable precautions to ensure it does not infringe on the rights of others, it is possible that Griffon may inadvertently infringe on, or be accused of infringing on, proprietary rights held by others. If Griffon is found to have infringed on the propriety rights held by others, any related litigation or settlement relating to such infringement may have a material effect on Griffon’s business, results of operations and financial condition.It is also possible that Griffon’s suppliers may inadvertently infringe on, or be accused of infringing on, proprietary rights held by others. For example, a product provided to HBP by one of its suppliers was found to infringe on the intellectual property rights of a competitor of this supplier. If other Griffon suppliers are found to have infringed (or are alleged to have infringed) on 23the propriety rights of others, such infringement may have a material adverse effect on Griffon’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For example, the supplier may not be able to develop an alternative design that meets Griffon’s needs at a comparable cost or at all, and the supply of certain products or components to Griffon may be interrupted. Griffon is exposed to product liability and warranty claims. Griffon is subject to product liability and warranty claims in the ordinary course of business, including with respect to former businesses now included within discontinued operations. These claims relate to the conformity of its products with required specifications, and to alleged or actual defects in Griffon’s products (or in end-products in which Griffon’s products were a component part) that cause damage to property or persons. There can be no assurance that the frequency and severity of product liability claims brought against Griffon will not increase, which claims can be brought either by an injured customer of an end product manufacturer who used one of Griffon's products as a component or by a direct purchaser. There is also no assurance that the number and value of warranty claims will not increase as compared to historical claim rates, or that Griffon's warranty reserve at any particular time is sufficient. No assurance can be given that indemnification from customers or coverage under insurance policies will be adequate to cover future product liability claims against Griffon; for example, product liability insurance typically does not cover claims for punitive damages. Warranty claims are typically not covered by insurance at all. Product liability insurance can be expensive, difficult to maintain and may be unobtainable in the future on acceptable terms. The amount and scope of any insurance coverage may be inadequate if a product liability claim is successfully asserted. Furthermore, if any significant claims are made, the business and the related financial condition of Griffon may be adversely affected by negative publicity. Griffon has been, and may in the future be, subject to claims and liabilities under environmental laws and regulations.Griffon’s operations and assets are subject to environmental laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment, the handling and disposal of wastes, including solid and hazardous wastes, and otherwise relating to health, safety and protection of the environment, in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Griffon does not expect to make any expenditure with respect to ongoing compliance with or remediation under these environmental laws and regulations that would have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results or financial condition. However, the applicable requirements under environmental laws and regulations may change at any time. Griffon can incur environmental costs related to sites that are no longer owned or operated, as well as third-party sites to which hazardous materials are sent. Material expenditures or liabilities may be incurred in connection with such claims. See the Commitment and Contingencies footnote in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on environmental contingencies. Based on facts presently known, the outcome of current environmental matters are not expected to have a material adverse effect on Griffon’s results of operations and financial condition. However, presently unknown environmental conditions, changes in environmental laws and regulations or other unanticipated events may give rise to claims that may involve material expenditures or liabilities. Changes in income tax laws and regulations or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect profitability.Griffon is subject to Federal, state and local income taxes in the U.S. and in various taxing jurisdictions outside the U.S. Tax provisions and liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various U.S. and international tax jurisdictions. Griffon’s effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in any valuation allowance for deferred tax assets or the amendment or enactment of tax laws. The amount of income taxes paid is subject to audits by U.S. Federal, state and local tax authorities, as well as tax authorities in the taxing jurisdictions outside the U.S. If such audits result in assessments different from recorded income tax liabilities, Griffon’s future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to its income tax provision.Actions taken by activist shareholders could be disruptive and costly and may conflict with or disrupt the strategic direction of our business.Similar to the activist shareholder campaign initiated in 2021, activist shareholders may from time to time attempt to effect changes in our strategic direction and seek changes regarding Griffon’s corporate governance or structure. Our Board of Directors and management team strive to maintain constructive, ongoing communications with all shareholders who wish to speak with us, including activist shareholders, and welcomes their views and opinions with the goal of working together constructively to enhance value for all shareholders. However, activist campaigns that contest, or conflict with, our strategic direction could have an adverse effect on us because:24a.responding to actions by activist shareholders can disrupt our operations, be costly and time consuming, and divert the attention of our Board and senior management from the pursuit of our business strategies, andb.perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may cause (i) instability or lack of continuity, which may be exploited by our competitors, (ii) concern on the part of current or potential customers, (iii) loss of business opportunities, or (iv) difficulties in attracting and retain qualified personnel and business partners.Activist campaigns may also cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions, or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the fundamental underlying value of our businesses"
1,GFF,GRIFFON CORP,2021-11-17,"Risk Factors
 Griffon’s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors which could cause Griffon’s actual results to vary materially from recent or anticipated future results. The risk factors discussed in this section should be carefully considered with all of the information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risk factors should not be considered the only risk factors facing Griffon. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that are currently deemed immaterial may also materially impact Griffon’s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows in the future. In general, Griffon is subject to the same general risks and uncertainties that impact other diverse manufacturing companies including, but not limited to, general economic, industry and/or market conditions and growth rates; impact of natural disasters and pandemics, and their effect on global markets; possible future terrorist threats and their effect on the worldwide economy; and changes in laws or accounting rules. Griffon has identified the following specific risks and uncertainties that it believes have the potential to materially affect its business and financial condition.19Risks Related to Our BusinessThe COVID-19 outbreak could adversely impact our results of operations.The future impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, or any other future pandemic, and the spread of the pathogen on a global basis could adversely affect our businesses in a number of respects, although the extent, nature and timing of such impact cannot be predicted as of the date of this filing. The COVID-19 outbreak has led countries around the world, as well as most states in the U.S., to implement restrictions from time-to-time relating to the operation of almost all types of businesses. Within the U.S., the standards vary from state to state, but typically require all but “critical”, “essential” or “life-sustaining” businesses to close all offices and facilities. We believe, based on the various standards published to date, that our businesses meet the requisite standard in all U.S states. We also believe that our businesses meet the applicable standards to remain open in Canada, the U.K., Ireland and Australia. As of the date of this filing, all of our manufacturing and distribution facilities in the U.S., Canada,  the U.K., Ireland, Australia and China are operating, although some of them are operating at reduced capacity as a result of our implementation of procedures designed to prevent the spread of the virus, such as social distancing and staggered shifts. However, government actions taken based on the changing nature of the outbreak in the U.S. or in other countries in which we do business, as well as the changing of standards regarding what type of facilities are permitted to remain open and evolving interpretations of existing standards, could result in additional closures of Griffon facilities.Our supply chain has experienced certain disruptions which, together with other factors such as a shortage of labor, has resulted in longer delivery lead times and restricted manufacturing capacity for certain of our products.  Commodity prices have increased during COVID-19 and may continue to increase, and we may not be able to pass off all or any of such price increases to our customers on a timely basis, or at all.  It is difficult to predict whether the supply chain disruptions that impact us will improve, worsen or remain the same in the near term.  Our suppliers could be required by government authorities to temporarily cease operations in accordance with the various restrictions discussed above; might be limited in their production capacity due to complying with restrictions relating to the operation of businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic; or could suffer their own supply chain disruptions, impacting their ability to continue to supply us with the quantity of materials required by us.  On September 9, 2021, President Biden announced a proposed new rule requiring that all employers with at least 100 employees require that their employees be fully vaccinated or tested weekly. The U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) issued an emergency temporary standard regulation to carry out this mandate. On November 6, 2021, the Unites States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit granted a stay of the emergency temporary standard, and on November 12, 2021 the Court upheld its stay and barred OSHA from enforcing the mandate “pending adequate judicial review” of a motion for permanent injunction. At this time, it is unclear, among other things, when the vaccine mandate will go into effect (or if it will go into effect at all); whether it will apply to all employees or only to employees who work in the office; and how compliance will be documented.As a company with more than 100 employees, it is anticipated that, should the vaccine mandate go into effect, we would be subject to the OSHA regulation concerning COVID-19 vaccination and the vaccine mandate. Should the mandate apply to us, we may be required to implement a requirement that all of our employees get vaccinated, subject to limited exceptions.  At this time, it is not possible to predict the impact that a vaccine mandate, or a vaccine requirement should we adopt one, will have on us or on our workforce. Any vaccine requirement or vaccine mandate, if implemented, may result in employee attrition, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.If as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, including a potential resurgence of the virus in the fall and winter months, governments take additional protective actions, or extend the time period for existing protective actions, it may have a material adverse impact on Griffon’s businesses and operating results. This could include additional closures of our facilities of an unknown duration, or the closure of the facilities of our customers, suppliers, or other vendors in our supply chain. Any disruption of our supply chain or the businesses of our customers could adversely impact our businesses and results of operations.  The COVID-19 outbreak has recently worsened in some U.S. states, and as a result, some states have put in place new restrictions regarding the operation of many types of businesses or have tightened up restrictions already in place.  Many medical experts believe that during the winter, as the weather gets colder and more people spend time with others indoors, the COVID-19 infection rate will worsen. In addition, the widespread public health crisis caused by the COVID-19 outbreak has adversely impacted the economies and financial markets worldwide, resulting in an economic downturn that has adversely impacted many businesses, including ours. The extent and duration of the impact on the global economy and financial markets from the COVID-19 outbreak is difficult to predict, and the extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak will negatively affect us and the duration of any potential business disruption is uncertain. The impact to our results will depend to a large extent on future developments and new information that may emerge regarding the duration and severity of the COVID-19 outbreak and the actions taken by authorities and other entities to contain the COVID-19 outbreak or treat its impact, and the impact of such actions, all of which are beyond our control. These potential impacts, while uncertain, could adversely affect our operating results. To the extent the COVID-19 outbreak adversely affects our businesses, operations, financial condition and operating 20results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks factors such as those relating to our high level of indebtedness, our need to generate sufficient cash flows to service our indebtedness, and our ability to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that govern our indebtedness, as described in more detail below.Current worldwide economic uncertainty and market volatility could adversely affect Griffon’s businesses. The current worldwide economic uncertainty and market volatility could continue to have an adverse effect on Griffon during 2022, particularly within the CPP and HBP segments, which is linked to the U.S. housing and the commercial property markets, and the U.S. economy in general.   Purchases of many CPP and HBP products are discretionary for consumers who are generally more willing to purchase products during periods in which favorable macroeconomic conditions prevail. These conditions could make it more difficult to obtain additional credit on favorable terms for investments in current businesses or for acquisitions, or could render financing unavailable; in addition, while we do not have any near term debt maturities, if these conditions persist, we may have difficulty refinancing our debt when it comes due.  Griffon is also exposed to certain fundamental economic risks including a decrease in the demand for the products and services it offers or a higher likelihood of default on its receivables. Adverse trends and general economic conditions, especially those that relate to construction and renovation, will impact Griffon’s business.The CPP and HBP businesses serve residential and commercial construction and renovation, and are influenced by market conditions that affect these industries. For the year ended September 30, 2021, approximately 54% and 46% of Griffon’s consolidated revenue was derived from the CPP and HBP segments, respectively, which was dependent on renovation of existing homes, new home construction, and commercial non-residential construction, repair and replacement. The strength of the U.S. economy, the age of existing home stock, job growth, interest rates, consumer confidence and the availability of consumer credit, as well as demographic factors such as migration into the U.S. and migration of the population within the U.S., have an effect on CPP and HBP.  To the extent market conditions for residential or commercial construction and renovation are weaker than expected, this will likely have an adverse impact on the performance and financial results of the CPP and HBP businesses.Griffon operates in highly competitive industries and may be unable to compete effectively. Griffon’s operating companies face intense competition in the markets they serve. Griffon competes primarily on the basis of technical expertise, product differentiation, quality of products and services, and price. There are a number of competitors to Griffon, some of which are larger and have greater resources than Griffon’s operating companies. Griffon's operating companies may face additional competition from companies that operate in countries with significantly lower operating costs.  Many CPP and HBP customers are large mass merchandisers, such as home centers, warehouse clubs, discount stores, commercial distributors and e-commerce companies. The growing share of the market represented by these large mass merchandisers, together with changes in consumer shopping patterns, have contributed to the increase of multi-category retailers and e-commerce companies that have strong negotiating power with suppliers. Many of these retailers import products directly from foreign suppliers to source and sell products under their own private label brands to compete with CPP and HBP products and brands, which puts increasing price pressure on the products of these businesses. In addition, the intense competition in the retail and e-commerce sectors, combined with the overall increasingly competitive economic environment, may result in a number of customers experiencing financial difficulty, or failing in the future. The loss of, or a failure by, one of CPP’s or HBP’s significant customers could adversely impact our sales and operating cash flows.To address all of these challenges, CPP and HBP must be able to respond to these competitive pressures, and the failure to respond effectively could result in a loss of sales, reduced profitability and a limited ability to recover cost increases through price increases. In addition, there can be no assurance that Griffon will not encounter increased competition in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on Griffon’s financial results.21The loss of large customers can harm financial results. A small number of customers account for, and are expected to continue to account for, a substantial portion of Griffon's consolidated revenue.  Home Depot, Lowe’s and Bunnings are significant customers of CPP, and Home Depot and Menards are significant customers of HBP.  Home Depot accounted for approximately 19% of consolidated revenue, 26% of CPP's revenue and 10% HBP's revenue for the year ended September 30, 2021.    Future operating results will continue to substantially depend on the success of Griffon’s largest customers, as well as Griffon’s relationships with them. Orders from these customers are subject to fluctuation and may be reduced materially due to changes in customer needs or other factors. Any reduction or delay in sales of products to one or more of these customers could significantly reduce Griffon’s revenue. Griffon’s operating results will also depend on successfully developing relationships with additional key customers. Griffon cannot assure that its largest customers will be retained or that additional key customers will be recruited. Also, both CPP and HBP extend credit to its customers, which exposes it to credit risk.  The largest customer accounted for approximately 28%, 7% and 19% of the net accounts receivable of CPP, HBP and Griffon’s net accounts receivable as of September 30, 2021, respectively. If this customer were to become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay its debts, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of CPP, HBP and Griffon could be adversely affected.A significant customer of our discontinued DE segment is the U.S. Government and its agencies and subcontractors, including Lockheed Martin and Boeing, and together accounts for approximately 69% of DE revenue.Reliance on third party suppliers and manufacturers may impair the ability of CPP and HBP to meet its customer demands. CPP and HBP rely on a limited number of domestic and foreign companies to supply components and manufacture certain of its products. The percentage of CPP and HBP worldwide sourced finished goods as a percent of revenue approximated 40% and 8%, respectively, in 2021. The percentage of CPP and HBP's worldwide sourced components as a percent of cost of goods sold approximated 9% and 19%, respectively, in 2021. Reliance on third party suppliers and manufacturers may reduce control over the timing of deliveries and quality of both CPP and HBP products. Reduced product quality or failure to deliver products timely may jeopardize relationships with certain of CPP's and HBP's key customers. In addition, reliance on third party suppliers or manufacturers may result in the failure to meet CPP and HBP customer demands. Continued turbulence in the worldwide economy may affect the liquidity and financial condition of CPP and HBP suppliers. Should any of these parties fail to manufacture sufficient supply, go out of business or discontinue a particular component, alternative suppliers may not be found in a timely manner, if at all. Such events may impact the ability of CPP and HBP to fill orders, which could have a material adverse effect on customer relationships.Recently, one of our suppliers informed HBP that a component it supplies to HBP was found to infringe on the intellectual property rights of one of its competitors.  This supplier has assured HBP that it is developing an alternative design for such component that will allow it to continue to meet HBP’s needs on an uninterrupted basis. However, should the supply of this component be interrupted, it could adversely impact HBP’s business and results of operations. If Griffon is unable to obtain raw materials for products at favorable prices it could adversely impact operating performance. CPP and HBP suppliers primarily provide resin, wood, steel and wire rod.  Both of these businesses could experience shortages of raw materials or components for products or be forced to seek alternative sources of supply. If temporary shortages due to disruptions in supply caused by weather, transportation, production delays or other factors require raw materials to be secured from sources other than current suppliers, the terms may not be as favorable as current terms or certain materials may not be available at all. In recent years, both CPP and HBP have experienced price increases for most of its raw materials. While most key raw materials used in Griffon’s businesses are generally available from numerous sources, raw materials are subject to price fluctuations. Because raw materials in the aggregate constitute a significant component of the cost of goods sold, price fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on Griffon’s results of operations. Griffon’s ability to pass raw material price increases to customers is limited due to supply arrangements and competitive pricing pressure, and there is generally a time lag between increased raw material costs and implementation of corresponding price increases for Griffon’s products. In particular, sharp increases in raw material prices are more difficult to pass through to customers and may negatively affect short-term financial performance.CPP is subject to risks from sourcing from international locations, especially China CPP's business is global, with products and raw materials sourced from, manufactured in and sold in multiple countries around the world. There are risks associated with conducting a business that may be impacted by political and other developments associated with international trade. In this regard, certain products sold by CPP in the United States and elsewhere are sourced 22from China; and raw materials used by CPP may be sourced from China and therefore may have their prices impacted by tariffs imposed on trade between the United States and China. The sourcing of CPP finished goods, components and raw materials from China are generally subject to supply agreements with Chinese companies. China does not have a well-developed, consolidated body of laws governing agreements with international customers. Enforcement of existing laws or contracts based on existing law may be uncertain and sporadic, and it may be difficult to obtain swift and equitable enforcement or to obtain enforcement of a judgment by a court of another jurisdiction. The relative inexperience of China’s judiciary on matters of international trade in many cases creates additional uncertainty as to the outcome of any litigation. In addition, interpretation of statutes and regulations in China may be subject to government policies or political changes. Because of the volume of sourcing by CPP from China, the ongoing trade dispute between the U.S. and China, including the imposition of tariffs on various Chinese imports into the U.S. at various times since March 2018, represents a continuing risk to CPP revenue and operating performance. The United States entered into what is described as “Phase 1” trade agreement with China on January 15, 2020, which reduces some existing tariffs that had been imposed and defers proposed increases of the tariff rate on an additional $250 billion of Chinese goods from 25% to 30% that had been planned for October 15, 2019, and proposed 15% tariffs on an additional $160 billion of a wide range of goods and materials imported from China to be effective December 15, 2019.  Under the Phase 1 agreement, existing 25% tariffs previously imposed on $250 billion of Chinese goods will remain in place, while a 15% tariff on another $120 billion of Chinese goods has been reduced to 7.5%.  In response, China has imposed tariffs on certain U.S. products, some of which are being reduced as part of the Phase 1 agreement. China may take additional actions if additional U.S. tariffs are reduced or imposed.  On May 8, 2020, the two countries reaffirmed their Phase 1 trade agreement notwithstanding the COVID-19 pandemic. In October 2021 the U.S. and Chinese trade representatives discussed the status of the Phase 1 agreement after the Biden administration outlined its agenda for trade policy with China. The Biden administration has indicated it will continue the strict tariffs against Chinese imports to maintain pressure on China to live up to its commitments under the Phase 1 agreement, while reinstating the process for U.S. importers to seek exclusions from the tariffs.  In view of the early stage of re-engagement on trade policy between the Chinese and U.S. governments, any potential impact on our business remains uncertain.  Any escalation of trade tensions or the imposition of additional tariffs by the U.S. Government on various steel and aluminum finished goods, as well as a variety of resins, fabrics and wood products could materially affect our operations. As a result of these tariffs and the fluid nature of ongoing trade negotiations, we intend to continue to manage our China supply base, which may include raising prices on certain goods. This may in turn result in reduced sales or the loss of customers and could impact our operating performance. The continuing political and economic conflicts between U.S. and China have resulted in and may continue to cause retaliatory policies from both countries, including a recent executive order issued by the U.S. President eliminating the preferential trade status of Hong Kong in response to China’s action to impose new security measures and regulation on Hong Kong. We cannot predict what new and additional retaliatory policies and regulations may be implemented by the Chinese government in response to U.S. actions, and such policies and regulations may adversely affect our business operations in China.CPP and HBP operations are also subject to the effects of international trade agreements and regulations such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, and the activities and regulations of the World Trade Organization. Although these trade agreements generally have positive effects on trade liberalization, sourcing flexibility and cost of goods by reducing or eliminating the duties and/or quotas assessed on products manufactured in a particular country, trade agreements can also adversely affect CPP and HBP businesses. For example, trade agreements can result in setting quotas on products that may be imported from a particular country into key markets including the U.S., Canada, Australia and the U.K., or may make it easier for other companies to compete by eliminating restrictions on products from countries where CPP and HBP competitors source products.The ability of CPP and HBP to import products in a timely and cost-effective manner may continue to be affected by conditions at ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers, such as port and shipping capacity, labor disputes, severe weather or increased homeland security requirements in the U.S. and other countries, as well as the potential for increased costs due to currency exchange fluctuations. These issues could delay importation of products or require CPP and HBP to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to customers. These alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher transit costs, which could have an adverse impact on CPP and HBP business and financial condition.23Griffon’s businesses are subject to seasonal variations and the impact of uncertain weather patterns. Griffon's revenue and earnings are generally lowest in our first and fourth quarters ending December 31, and September 30, respectively, and highest in the second and third quarters ending March 31, and June 30, respectively, primarily due to the seasonality within the AMES and Clopay businesses.  In 2021, 53% of AMES' sales occurred during the second and third quarters compared to 53% and 56% in 2020 and 2019, respectively.   In 2021 and 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, sales orders shifted somewhat into the third and fourth quarters resulting in revenue increasing in these two quarters to 55% in each of 2021 and 2020 sales. Clopay’s business is driven by renovation and construction during warm weather, which is generally at reduced levels during the winter months, generally in our second quarter.Telephonics historically has had higher revenue and earnings in the second half of Griffon's fiscal year ending September 30 (although this has not always been the case).Demand for lawn and garden products is influenced by weather, particularly weekend weather during the peak gardening season. AMES' sales volumes could be adversely affected by certain weather patterns such as unseasonably cool or warm temperatures, hurricanes, water shortages or floods. In addition, lack of snow or lower than average snowfall during the winter season may result in reduced sales of certain AMES' products such as snow shovels and other snow tools. As a result, AMES' results of operations, financial results and cash flows could be adversely impacted.Unionized employees could strike or participate in a work stoppage. At September 30, 2021, Griffon employed approximately 6,700 people on a full-time basis, excluding approximately 700 related to Telephonics, approximately 5% of whom are covered by collective bargaining or similar labor agreements (all within Telephonics and CPP). If unionized employees engage in a strike or other work stoppage, or if Griffon is unable to negotiate acceptable extensions of agreements with labor unions, a significant disruption of operations and increased operating costs could occur. In addition, any renegotiation or renewal of labor agreements could result in higher wages or benefits paid to unionized employees, which could increase operating costs and as a result have a material adverse effect on profitability.   Telephonics’ business depends heavily upon government contracts and, therefore, the defense budget. Telephonics sells products to the U.S. Government and its agencies both directly and indirectly as a first-tier supplier to prime contractors in the defense industry such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Northrop Grumman. In the year ended September 30, 2021, U.S. government contracts and subcontracts accounted for approximately 10% of the combined revenue of Griffon’s consolidated revenue and Telephonics revenue.  Contracts involving the U.S. government may include various risks, including: •Termination for default or for convenience by the government;•Reduction or modification in the event of changes in the government’s requirements or budgetary constraints;•Increased or unexpected costs, causing losses or reduced profits under contracts where Telephonics’ prices are fixed, or determinations that certain costs are not allowable under particular government contracts;•The failure or inability of the prime contractor to perform its contract under circumstances in which Telephonics is a subcontractor;•Failure to observe and comply with government  and procurement regulations such that Telephonics could be suspended or barred from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts;•The failure of the government to exercise options for additional work provided for in contracts;•The inherent discretion of government agencies in determining whether Telephonics has complied with all specifications set forth in a government contract; and•The government’s right, in certain circumstances, to freely use technology developed under these contracts.Telephonics’ U.S. Government end-user contracts contain a termination for convenience clause, regardless if Telephonics is the prime contractor or the subcontractor. This clause generally entitles Telephonics, upon a termination for convenience, to receive the purchase price for delivered items, reimbursement of allowable work-in-process costs, and an allowance for profit. Allowable costs would include the costs to terminate existing agreements with suppliers. The programs in which Telephonics participate may extend for several years, and may be funded on an incremental basis. Decreases in the U.S. defense budget, in particular with respect to programs to which Telephonics supplies materials, could have a material adverse impact on Telephonics' financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows. The U.S. government may not continue to fund programs to which Telephonics’ development projects apply. Even if funding is continued, Telephonics may fail to compete successfully to obtain funding pursuant to such programs. Reductions to funding on existing 24programs or delays in the funding of new opportunities could affect the timing of revenue recognition, and impact Telephonics' and Griffon's results of operations.Telephonics’ business could be adversely affected by a government shutdown The impact of a government shutdown for any duration could have a material adverse effect on Telephonics’ revenues, profits and cash flows. Telephonics relies on government personnel to conduct routine business processes related to the inspection and delivery of products for various programs, to approve and pay certain billings and invoices, to process export licenses and for other administrative services that, if disrupted, could have an immediate impact on Telephonics’ business. Telephonics’ business could be adversely affected by a negative audit by the U.S. Government As a government contractor, and a subcontractor to government contractors, Telephonics is subject to audits and investigations by U.S. Government Agencies such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Defense Security Service, with respect to its classified contracts, other Inspectors General and the Department of Justice. These agencies review a contractor’s performance under its contracts, its cost structure and compliance with applicable laws and standards as well as compliance with applicable regulations, including those relating to facility and personnel security clearances. These agencies also review the adequacy of, and a contractor’s compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the contractor’s management, purchasing, property, estimating, compensation, and accounting and information systems. Any costs found to be misclassified or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed, or must be refunded if already billed and collected. Griffon could incur significant expenses in complying with audits and subpoenas issued by the government in aid of inquiries and investigations. If an audit or an investigation uncovers a failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, or improper or illegal activities, Telephonics may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and/or administrative sanctions, which could include contract termination, forfeiture of profit, suspension of payments, fines, including treble damages, and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. Government. In addition, if allegations of impropriety are made, Telephonics and Griffon could suffer serious harm to their reputation. Many Telephonics contracts contain performance obligations that require innovative design capabilities, are technologically complex, or are dependent upon factors not wholly within Telephonics' control. Failure to meet these obligations could adversely affect customer relations, future business opportunities, and overall profitability. Telephonics designs, develops and manufactures advanced and innovative surveillance and communication products for a broad range of applications for use in varying environments. As with many of Telephonics' programs, system specifications, operational requirements and test requirements are challenging, exacerbated by the need for quick delivery schedules. Technical problems encountered and delays in the development or delivery of such products, as well as the inherent discretion involved in government approval related to compliance with applicable specifications of products supplied under government contracts, could prevent Telephonics from meeting contractual obligations, which could subject Telephonics to termination for default. Under a termination for default, the company is entitled to negotiate payment for undelivered work if the Government requests the transfer of title and delivery of partially completed supplies and materials. Conversely, if the Government does not make this request, there is no obligation to reimburse the company for its costs incurred. Telephonics may also be subject to the repayment of advance and progress payments, if any. Additionally, Telephonics may be liable to the Government for any of its excess costs incurred in acquiring supplies and services similar to those terminated for default, and for other damages. Should any of the foregoing events occur, it could result in a material adverse effect on Griffon's financial position.Griffon's business could be negatively affected by cyber or other security threats or other disruptions.Griffon and its operating companies are subjected to cyber and other security threats common to U.S. businesses. As a U.S. defense contractor, Telephonics, in particular, may be the target of cyber security threats to its information technology infrastructure and unauthorized attempts to gain access to sensitive or highly confidential information that could compromise U.S. security.  The types of threats could vary from attacks common to most industries to more advanced and persistent, highly organized adversaries who target Telephonics because of national security information in its possession. Individuals and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including organizations sponsored by foreign countries, may use a wide variety of methods, such as deploying malicious software or exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware, software, or other infrastructure in order to gain access to our networks or using social engineering techniques to induce our employees to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or take other actions to gain access to our data. Inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access to confidential data. For example, system administrators may fail to timely remove employee account access when no longer appropriate. Employees or third parties may also intentionally compromise our systems, security or confidential information. 25If Telephonics is unable to protect sensitive information, its customers or governmental authorities could question the adequacy of its security processes and procedures and its compliance with evolving government cyber security requirements for government contractors. Due to the evolving nature of these security threats, and the increasing difficulty of detecting and defending against them, the risk and impact of any future incident cannot be predicted.The costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions could be significant.  Security events such as these could adversely affect Griffon's internal operations, future financial results and reputation, as well as result in the loss of competitive advantages derived from research and development efforts and other intellectual property.Griffon may be unable to implement its acquisition growth strategy, which may result in added expenses without a commensurate increase in revenue and income, and divert management’s attention.Making strategic acquisitions is a significant part of Griffon’s growth plans. The ability to successfully complete acquisitions depends on identifying and acquiring, on acceptable terms, companies that either complement or enhance currently held businesses or expand Griffon into new profitable businesses, and, for certain acquisitions, obtaining financing on acceptable terms. Additionally, Griffon must properly integrate acquired businesses in order to maximize profitability. The competition for acquisition candidates is intense and Griffon cannot assure that it will successfully identify acquisition candidates and complete acquisitions at reasonable purchase prices, in a timely manner, or at all. Further, there is a risk that acquisitions will not be properly integrated into Griffon’s existing structure. Griffon closed the acquisitions of La Hacienda, Tuscan Path, ClosetMaid and Harper Brush in the months of July through November 2017, Kelkay in February 2018, CornellCookson in June 2018, Apta in November 2019 and Quatro in December 2020. This integration risk may be exacerbated when numerous acquisitions are consummated in a short time period.In implementing an acquisition growth strategy, the following may be encountered:•Costs associated with incomplete or poorly implemented acquisitions;•Expenses, delays and difficulties of integrating acquired companies into Griffon’s existing organization;•Dilution of the interest of existing stockholders;•Diversion of management’s attention; or•Difficulty in obtaining financing on acceptable terms, or at all.An unsuccessful implementation of Griffon’s acquisition growth strategy, including the failure to properly integrate acquisitions, could have an adverse impact on Griffon’s results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. We may also incur debt or assume contingent liabilities in connection with acquisitions, which could impose restrictions on our business operations and harm our operating results.Risks Related to Our IndebtednessWhile Griffon’s senior notes, which have limited covenants, are not due until 2028, and while its $400 million revolving line of credit, which is largely undrawn and has greater covenant requirements, does not mature until 2025, there are potential impacts from Griffon’s use of debt to finance certain of its activities, especially acquisitions and expansions, as set forth below.Compliance with restrictions and covenants in Griffon’s debt agreements may limit its ability to take corporate actions.The credit agreement entered into by, and, to a lesser extent, the terms of the senior notes issued by, Griffon each contain covenants that restrict the ability of Griffon and its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional debt, pay dividends, incur liens and make investments, acquisitions, dispositions, restricted payments and capital expenditures. Under the credit agreement, which is largely undrawn, Griffon is also required to comply with specific financial ratios and tests. Griffon may not be able to comply in the future with these covenants or restrictions as a result of events beyond its control, such as prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions or a change in control of Griffon. If Griffon defaults in maintaining compliance with the covenants and restrictions in its credit agreement or the senior notes, its lenders could declare all of the principal and interest amounts outstanding due and payable and, in the case of the credit agreement, terminate the commitments to extend credit to Griffon in the future. If Griffon or its subsidiaries are unable to secure credit in the future, its business could be harmed.26Griffon may be unable to raise additional financing if needed.Griffon may need to raise additional financing in the future in order to implement its business plan, refinance debt, or acquire new or complimentary businesses or assets. Any required additional financing may be unavailable, or only available at unfavorable terms, due to uncertainties in the credit markets. If Griffon raises additional funds by issuing equity securities, current holders of its common stock may experience significant ownership interest dilution and the holders of the new securities may have rights senior to the rights associated with current outstanding common stock.Griffon’s indebtedness and interest expense could limit cash flow and adversely affect operations and Griffon’s ability to make full payment on outstanding debt.Griffon’s indebtedness poses potential risks such as:•A substantial portion of cash flows from operations could be used to pay principal and interest on debt, thereby reducing the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, product development and other general corporate purposes;•Insufficient cash flows from operations may force Griffon to sell assets, or seek additional capital, which Griffon may not be able to secure on favorable terms, if at all; and•Its level of indebtedness may make Griffon more vulnerable to economic or industry downturns.Risk Related to Our Common StockGriffon has the ability to issue additional equity securities, which would lead to dilution of issued and outstanding common stock.The issuance of additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities would result in dilution to existing stockholders’ equity interests. Griffon is authorized to issue, without stockholder vote or approval, 3,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series, and has the ability to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of any such series. Any such series of preferred stock could contain dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices, liquidation preferences or other rights superior to the rights of holders of Griffon’s common stock.  While there is no present intention of issuing any such preferred stock, Griffon reserves the right to do so at any time. In addition, Griffon is authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, up to 85,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 56,613,011 shares, net of treasury shares, were outstanding as of September 30, 2021. Additionally, Griffon is authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, securities convertible into either shares of common stock or preferred stock.General Risk Factors
Each of Griffon's businesses faces risks related to the disruption of its primary manufacturing facilities.The manufacturing facilities for each of Griffon's businesses are concentrated in just a few locations, and in the case of CPP, some of these locations are abroad in low-cost locations. Any of Griffon's manufacturing facilities are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, such as natural or man-made disasters, pandemics, terrorist activities, disruptions of information technology resources, and utility interruptions. Such disruptions may cause delays in shipping products, which could result in the loss of business or customer trust, adversely affecting Griffon’s businesses and operating results.Manufacturing capacity constraints or increased manufacturing costs may have a material adverse effect on Griffon's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Griffon’s current manufacturing resources may be inadequate to meet significantly increased demand for some of its products. Griffon’s ability to increase its manufacturing capacity depends on many factors, including the availability of capital, steadily increasing consumer demand, equipment delivery, construction lead-times, installation, qualification, and permitting and other regulatory requirements. Increasing capacity through the use of third-party manufacturers may depend on Griffon’s ability to develop and maintain such relationships and the ability of such third parties to devote additional capacity to fill its orders.A lack of sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand could cause customer service levels to decrease, which may negatively affect customer demand for Griffon's products and customer relations generally, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on Griffon's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, operating facilities 27at or near capacity may also increase production and distribution costs and negatively impact relations with employees or contractors, which could result in disruptions to operations.In addition, manufacturing costs may increase significantly and Griffon may not be able to pass along all or any of such increase to its customers; and when such increases are passed off to customers, there will be a time lag, which may be significant. If CPP and HBP do not continue to develop and maintain leading brands or realize the anticipated benefits of advertising and promotion spend, its operating results may suffer.The ability of CPP and HBP to compete successfully depends in part on the company’s ability to develop and maintain leading brands so that retail and other customers will need its products to meet consumer demand. Leading brands allow both CPP and HBP to realize economies of scale in its operations. The development and maintenance of such brands require significant investment in brand-building and marketing initiatives. While CPP and HBP plan to continue to increase its expenditures for advertising and promotion and other brand-building and marketing initiatives over the long term, the initiatives may not deliver the anticipated results and the results of such initiatives may not cover the costs of the increased investment. Griffon may be required to record impairment charges for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.Griffon is required to assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually for impairment or on an interim basis if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest impairment exists. If impairment testing indicates that the carrying value of reporting units or indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds the respective fair value, an impairment charge would be recognized. If goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets were to become impaired, the results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.If Griffon's subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform their obligations, Griffon's performance and ability to win future business could be harmed.Griffon relies on other companies to provide materials, major components and products to fulfill contractual obligations. Such arrangements may involve subcontracts, teaming arrangements, or supply agreements with other companies. There is a risk that Griffon may have disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed. In addition, changes in the economic environment, including defense budgets and constraints on available financing, may adversely affect the financial stability of Griffon's supply chain and their ability to meet their performance requirements or to provide needed supplies on a timely basis. A disruption or failure of any supplier could have an adverse effect on Griffon's business resulting in an impact to profitability, possible termination of a contract, imposition of fines or penalties, and harm to Griffon's reputation impacting its ability to secure future business.Griffon’s companies must continually improve existing products, design and sell new products and invest in research and development in order to compete effectively. The markets for Griffon’s products are characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and continuous improvements in products. Due to constant changes in Griffon's markets, future success depends on Griffon's ability to develop new technologies, products, processes and product applications.  Griffon's long-term success in the competitive retail environment and the industrial and commercial markets depends on its ability to develop and commercialize a continuing stream of innovative new products that are appealing to ultimate end users and create demand. New product development and commercialization efforts, including efforts to enter markets or product categories in which Griffon has limited or no prior experience, have inherent risks. These risks include the costs involved, such as development and commercialization, product development or launch delays, and the failure of new products and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance or growth in sales or operating income.Griffon also faces the risk that its competitors will introduce innovative new products that compete with Griffon’s products.  In addition, sales generated by new products could cause a decline in sales of Griffon’s other existing products. If new product development and commercialization efforts are not successful, Griffon’s financial results could be adversely affected.28Product and technological developments are accomplished both through internally-funded R&D projects, as well as through strategic partnerships with customers. Because it is not generally possible to predict the amount of time required and costs involved in achieving certain R&D objectives, actual development costs may exceed budgeted amounts and estimated product development schedules may be extended. Griffon’s financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if: •Product improvements are not completed on a timely basis;•New products are not introduced on a timely basis or do not achieve sufficient market penetration;•There are budget overruns or delays in R&D efforts; or•New products experience reliability or quality problems, or otherwise do not meet customer preferences or requirements. The loss of certain key officers or employees could adversely affect Griffon’s business. The success of Griffon is materially dependent upon the continued services of certain key officers and employees. The loss of such key personnel could have a material adverse effect on Griffon’s operating results or financial condition. Griffon is exposed to a variety of risks relating to non-U.S. sales and operations, including non-U.S. economic and political conditions and fluctuations in exchange rates.Griffon and its companies conduct operations in Canada, Australasia, the U.K., Mexico and China, and sell their products in many countries around the world. Sales of products through non-U.S. subsidiaries accounted for approximately 17% of consolidated revenue for the year ended September 30, 2021. These sales could be adversely affected by changes in political and economic conditions, trade protection measures, such as tariffs, the ability of the Company to enter into industrial cooperation agreements (offset agreements), differing intellectual property rights and laws and changes in regulatory requirements that restrict the sales of products or increase costs in such locations. Enforcement of existing laws in such jurisdictions can be uncertain, and the lack of a sophisticated body of laws can create various uncertainties, including with respect to customer and supplier contracts. Currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in the non-U.S. regions in which Griffon does business may also have an impact on future reported financial results.Griffon's international sales and operations are subject to applicable laws relating to trade, export controls and foreign corrupt practices, the violation of which could adversely affect operations. Griffon is subject to various anti-corruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. In addition, Griffon is subject to export controls, laws and regulations such as the Arms Export Control Act, the International Traffic in Arms Regulation and the Export Administration Regulations, as well as to economic sanctions, laws and embargoes imposed by various governments or organizations, including the U.S. and the European Union or member countries. Violations of anti-corruption, export controls or sanctions laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties, including debarment, loss of export privileges and loss of authorizations needed to conduct Griffon's international business, and could harm the ability to enter into contracts with the U.S. Government. Such violations could also result in Griffon being subject to other liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on Griffon's business, results of operations and financial condition.Griffon may not be able to protect its proprietary rights. Griffon relies on a combination of patent, copyright and trademark laws, common law, trade secrets, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions to protect proprietary rights. Such measures do not provide absolute protection and Griffon cannot give assurance that measures for protecting these proprietary rights are and will be adequate, or that competitors will not independently develop similar technologies. Griffon may inadvertently infringe on, or may be accused of infringing on, proprietary rights held by another party. Griffon is regularly improving its technology and employing existing technologies in new ways. Though Griffon takes reasonable precautions to ensure it does not infringe on the rights of others, it is possible that Griffon may inadvertently infringe on, or be accused of infringing on, proprietary rights held by others. If Griffon is found to have infringed on the propriety rights held by others, any related litigation or settlement relating to such infringement may have a material effect on Griffon’s business, results of operations and financial condition. 29Griffon is exposed to product liability and warranty claims. Griffon is subject to product liability and warranty claims in the ordinary course of business, including with respect to former businesses now included within discontinued operations. These claims relate to the conformity of its products with required specifications, and to alleged or actual defects in Griffon’s products (or in end-products in which Griffon’s products were a component part) that cause damage to property or persons. There can be no assurance that the frequency and severity of product liability claims brought against Griffon will not increase, which claims can be brought either by an injured customer of an end product manufacturer who used one of Griffon's products as a component or by a direct purchaser. There is also no assurance that the number and value of warranty claims will not increase as compared to historical claim rates, or that Griffon's warranty reserve at any particular time is sufficient. No assurance can be given that indemnification from customers or coverage under insurance policies will be adequate to cover future product liability claims against Griffon; for example, product liability insurance typically does not cover claims for punitive damages. Warranty claims are typically not covered by insurance at all. Product liability insurance can be expensive, difficult to maintain and may be unobtainable in the future on acceptable terms. The amount and scope of any insurance coverage may be inadequate if a product liability claim is successfully asserted. Furthermore, if any significant claims are made, the business and the related financial condition of Griffon may be adversely affected by negative publicity. Griffon has been, and may in the future be, subject to claims and liabilities under environmental laws and regulations.Griffon’s operations and assets are subject to environmental laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment, the handling and disposal of wastes, including solid and hazardous wastes, and otherwise relating to health, safety and protection of the environment, in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Griffon does not expect to make any expenditure with respect to ongoing compliance with or remediation under these environmental laws and regulations that would have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results or financial condition. However, the applicable requirements under environmental laws and regulations may change at any time. Griffon can incur environmental costs related to sites that are no longer owned or operated, as well as third-party sites to which hazardous materials are sent. Material expenditures or liabilities may be incurred in connection with such claims. See the Commitment and Contingencies footnote in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on environmental contingencies. Based on facts presently known, the outcome of current environmental matters are not expected to have a material adverse effect on Griffon’s results of operations and financial condition. However, presently unknown environmental conditions, changes in environmental laws and regulations or other unanticipated events may give rise to claims that may involve material expenditures or liabilities. Changes in income tax laws and regulations or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect profitability.Griffon is subject to Federal, state and local income taxes in the U.S. and in various taxing jurisdictions outside the U.S. Tax provisions and liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various U.S. and international tax jurisdictions. Griffon’s effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in any valuation allowance for deferred tax assets or the amendment or enactment of tax laws. The amount of income taxes paid is subject to audits by U.S. Federal, state and local tax authorities, as well as tax authorities in the taxing jurisdictions outside the U.S. If such audits result in assessments different from recorded income tax liabilities, Griffon’s future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to its income tax provision.Actions taken by activist shareholders could be disruptive and costly and may conflict with or disrupt the strategic direction of our business.Activist shareholders may from time to time attempt to effect changes in our strategic direction and seek changes regarding Griffon’s corporate governance or structure. Our Board of Directors and management team strive to maintain constructive, ongoing communications with all shareholders who wish to speak with us, including activist shareholders, and welcomes their views and opinions with the goal of working together constructively to enhance value for all shareholders. However, activist campaigns that contest, or conflict with, our strategic direction could have an adverse effect on us because:a.responding to actions by activist shareholders can disrupt our operations, be costly and time consuming, and divert the attention of our Board and senior management from the pursuit of our business strategies, andb.perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may cause (i) instability or lack of continuity, which may be exploited by our competitors, (ii) concern on the part of current or potential customers, (iii) loss of business opportunities, or (iv) difficulties in attracting and retain qualified personnel and business partners.30Activist campaigns may also cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions, or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the fundamental underlying value of our businesses"
2,GFF,GRIFFON CORP,2020-11-13,"Risk Factors
 Griffon’s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors which could cause Griffon’s actual results to vary materially from recent or anticipated future results. The risk factors discussed in this section should be carefully considered with all of the information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risk factors should not be considered the only risk factors facing Griffon. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that are currently deemed immaterial may also materially impact Griffon’s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows in the future. In general, Griffon is subject to the same general risks and uncertainties that impact other diverse manufacturing companies including, but not limited to, general economic, industry and/or market conditions and growth rates; impact of natural disasters and pandemics, and their effect on global markets; possible future terrorist threats and their effect on the worldwide economy; and changes in laws or accounting rules. Griffon has identified the following specific risks and uncertainties that it believes have the potential to materially affect its business and financial condition.Risks Related to Our BusinessThe COVID-19 outbreak could adversely impact our results of operations.The future impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and the spread of the pathogen on a global basis could adversely affect our businesses in a number of respects, although the extent, nature and timing of such impact cannot be predicted as of the date of this filing. The COVID-19 outbreak has led countries around the world, as well as most states in the U.S., to implement restrictions from time-to-time relating to the operation of almost all types of businesses. Within the U.S., the standards vary from state to state, but typically require all but “critical”, “essential” or “life-sustaining” businesses to close all offices and facilities. We believe, based on the various standards published to date, that our businesses meet the requisite standard in all U.S states. We also believe that our businesses meet the applicable standards to remain open in Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Australia. As of the date 18of this filing, all of our manufacturing and distribution facilities in the U.S., Canada,  the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia and China are operating, although some of them are operating at reduced capacity as a result of our implementation of procedures designed to prevent the spread of the virus, such as social distancing and staggered shifts. However, government actions taken based on the changing nature of the outbreak in the U.S. or in other countries in which we do business, as well as the changing of standards regarding what type of facilities are permitted to remain open and evolving interpretations of existing standards, could result in additional closures of Griffon facilities.To date, our supply chain has not experienced significant disruptions, and at this time we do not anticipate any such significant disruptions in the near term. However, our suppliers could be required by government authorities to temporarily cease operations in accordance with the various restrictions discussed above; might be limited in their production capacity due to complying with restrictions relating to the operation of businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic; or could suffer their own supply chain disruptions, impacting their ability to continue to supply us with the quantity of materials required by us.If as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, including a potential resurgence of the virus in the fall and winter months, governments take additional protective actions, or extend the time period for existing protective actions, it may have a material adverse impact on Griffon’s businesses and operating results. This could include additional closures of our facilities of an unknown duration, or the closure of the facilities of our customers, suppliers, or other vendors in our supply chain. Any disruption of our supply chain or the businesses of our customers could adversely impact our businesses and results of operations.  The COVID-19 outbreak has recently worsened in many U.S. states, and as a result, certain states have put in place new restrictions regarding the operation of many types of businesses or have tightened up restrictions already in place.  Many medical experts believe that during the winter, as the weather gets colder and more people spend time with others indoors, the COVID-19 infection rate will worsen. In addition, the widespread public health crisis caused by the COVID-19 outbreak has adversely impacted the economies and financial markets worldwide, resulting in an economic downturn that has adversely impacted many businesses, including ours. The extent and duration of the impact on the global economy and financial markets from the COVID-19 outbreak is difficult to predict, and the extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak will negatively affect us and the duration of any potential business disruption is uncertain. The impact to our results will depend to a large extent on future developments and new information that may emerge regarding the duration and severity of the COVID-19 outbreak and the actions taken by authorities and other entities to contain the COVID-19 outbreak or treat its impact, and the impact of such actions, all of which are beyond our control. These potential impacts, while uncertain, could adversely affect our operating results. To the extent the COVID-19 outbreak adversely affects our businesses, operations, financial condition and operating results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks factors such as those relating to our high level of indebtedness, our need to generate sufficient cash flows to service our indebtedness, and our ability to comply with the covenants contained in the agreements that govern our indebtedness, as described in more detail below.Current worldwide economic uncertainty and market volatility could adversely affect Griffon’s businesses. The current worldwide economic uncertainty and market volatility could continue to have an adverse effect on Griffon during 2021, particularly within the CPP and HBP segments, which is linked to the U.S. housing and the commercial property markets, and the U.S. economy in general.   Purchases of many CPP and HBP products are discretionary for consumers who are generally more willing to purchase products during periods in which favorable macroeconomic conditions prevail. Disruptions in the credit markets have increased the spread between the yields realized on risk-free and higher risk securities, resulting in illiquidity in parts of the credit markets. These conditions could make it more difficult to obtain additional credit on favorable terms for investments in current businesses or for acquisitions, or could render financing unavailable; in addition, while we do not have any near term debt maturities, if these conditions persist, we may have difficulty refinancing our debt when it comes due.  Griffon is also exposed to certain fundamental economic risks including a decrease in the demand for the products and services it offers or a higher likelihood of default on its receivables. Adverse trends and general economic conditions, especially those that relate to construction and renovation, will impact Griffon’s business.The CPP and HBP businesses serve residential and commercial construction and renovation, and are influenced by market conditions that affect these industries. For the year ended September 30, 2020, approximately 47% and 39% of Griffon’s consolidated revenue was derived from the CPP and HBP segments, respectively, which was dependent on renovation of existing homes, new home construction, and commercial non-residential construction, repair and replacement. The strength of the U.S. economy, the age of existing home stock, job growth, interest rates, consumer confidence and the availability of consumer credit, as well as demographic factors such as migration into the U.S. and migration of the population within the U.S., have an effect on CPP and HBP.  To the extent market conditions for residential or commercial construction and renovation are weaker than expected, this will likely have an adverse impact on the performance and financial results of the CPP and HBP businesses.Griffon operates in highly competitive industries and may be unable to compete effectively.19 Griffon’s operating companies face intense competition in the markets they serve. Griffon competes primarily on the basis of technical expertise, product differentiation, quality of products and services, and price. There are a number of competitors to Griffon, some of which are larger and have greater resources than Griffon’s operating companies. Griffon's operating companies may face additional competition from companies that operate in countries with significantly lower operating costs.  Many CPP and HBP customers are large mass merchandisers, such as home centers, warehouse clubs, discount stores, commercial distributors and e-commerce companies. The growing share of the market represented by these large mass merchandisers, together with changes in consumer shopping patterns, have contributed to the increase of multi-category retailers and e-commerce companies that have strong negotiating power with suppliers. Many of these retailers import products directly from foreign suppliers to source and sell products under their own private label brands to compete with CPP and HBP products and brands, which puts increasing price pressure on the products of these businesses. In addition, the intense competition in the retail and e-commerce sectors, combined with the overall increasingly competitive economic environment, may result in a number of customers experiencing financial difficulty, or failing in the future. The loss of, or a failure by, one of CPP’s or HBP’s significant customers could adversely impact our sales and operating cash flows.To address all of these challenges, CPP and HBP must be able to respond to these competitive pressures, and the failure to respond effectively could result in a loss of sales, reduced profitability and a limited ability to recover cost increases through price increases. In addition, there can be no assurance that Griffon will not encounter increased competition in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on Griffon’s financial results.The loss of large customers can harm financial results. A small number of customers account for, and are expected to continue to account for, a substantial portion of Griffon's consolidated revenue.  Home Depot, Lowe’s and Bunnings are significant customers of CPP, and Home Depot and Menards are significant customers of HBP.  Home Depot accounted for approximately 17% of consolidated revenue, 27% of CPP's revenue and 12% HBP's revenue for the year ended September 30, 2020. The U.S. Government and its agencies and subcontractors, including Lockheed Martin and Boeing, is a significant customer of DE, and together accounts for approximately 10% of consolidated revenue and 69% of DE segment revenue (Lockheed Martin and Boeing each individually represent less than 10% of consolidated revenue inclusive of such sales to the U.S. Government). Future operating results will continue to substantially depend on the success of Griffon’s largest customers, as well as Griffon’s relationships with them. Orders from these customers are subject to fluctuation and may be reduced materially due to changes in customer needs or other factors. Any reduction or delay in sales of products to one or more of these customers could significantly reduce Griffon’s revenue. Griffon’s operating results will also depend on successfully developing relationships with additional key customers. Griffon cannot assure that its largest customers will be retained or that additional key customers will be recruited. Also, both CPP and HBP extend credit to its customers, which exposes it to credit risk.  The largest customer accounted for approximately 28%, 6% and 18% of the net accounts receivable of CPP, HBP and Griffon’s net accounts receivable as of September 30, 2020, respectively. If this customer were to become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay its debts, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of CPP, HBP and Griffon could be adversely affected.Reliance on third party suppliers and manufacturers may impair CPP and HBP ability to meet its customer demands. CPP and HBP rely on a limited number of domestic and foreign companies to supply components and manufacture certain of its products. The percentage of CPP and HBP worldwide sourced finished goods as a percent of revenue approximated 31% and 9%, respectively, in 2020. The percentage of CPP and HBP's worldwide sourced components as a percent of cost of goods sold approximated 10% and 17%, respectively, in 2020. Reliance on third party suppliers and manufacturers may reduce control over the timing of deliveries and quality of both CPP and HBP products. Reduced product quality or failure to deliver products timely may jeopardize relationships with certain of CPP's and HBP's key customers. In addition, reliance on third party suppliers or manufacturers may result in the failure to meet CPP and HBP customer demands. Continued turbulence in the worldwide economy may affect the liquidity and financial condition of CPP and HBP suppliers. Should any of these parties fail to manufacture sufficient supply, go out of business or discontinue a particular component, alternative suppliers may not be found in a timely manner, if at all. Such events could impact the ability of  CPP and HBP to fill orders, which could have a material adverse effect on customer relationships. 20If Griffon is unable to obtain raw materials for products at favorable prices it could adversely impact operating performance. CPP and HBP suppliers primarily provide resin, wood, steel and wire rod.  Both of these businesses could experience shortages of raw materials or components for products or be forced to seek alternative sources of supply. If temporary shortages due to disruptions in supply caused by weather, transportation, production delays or other factors require raw materials to be secured from sources other than current suppliers, the terms may not be as favorable as current terms or certain materials may not be available at all. In recent years, both CPP and HBP have experienced price increases in steel and plastic resins. While most key raw materials used in Griffon’s businesses are generally available from numerous sources, raw materials are subject to price fluctuations. Because raw materials in the aggregate constitute a significant component of the cost of goods sold, price fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on Griffon’s results of operations. Griffon’s ability to pass raw material price increases to customers is limited due to supply arrangements and competitive pricing pressure, and there is generally a time lag between increased raw material costs and implementation of corresponding price increases for Griffon’s products. In particular, sharp increases in raw material prices are more difficult to pass through to customers and may negatively affect short-term financial performance.CPP is subject to risks from sourcing from international locations, especially China CPP's business is global, with products and raw materials sourced from, manufactured in and sold in multiple countries around the world. There are risks associated with conducting a business that may be impacted by political and other developments associated with international trade. In this regard, certain products sold by CPP in the United States and elsewhere are sourced from China; and raw materials used by CPP may be sourced from China and therefore may have their prices impacted by tariffs imposed on trade between the United States and China. The sourcing of CPP finished goods, components and raw materials from China are generally subject to supply agreements with Chinese companies. China does not have a well-developed, consolidated body of laws governing agreements with international customers. Enforcement of existing laws or contracts based on existing law may be uncertain and sporadic, and it may be difficult to obtain swift and equitable enforcement or to obtain enforcement of a judgment by a court of another jurisdiction. The relative inexperience of China’s judiciary on matters of international trade in many cases creates additional uncertainty as to the outcome of any litigation. In addition, interpretation of statutes and regulations in China may be subject to government policies reflecting domestic political changes. Because of the volume of sourcing by CPP from China, the ongoing trade dispute between the U.S. and China, including the imposition of tariffs on various Chinese imports into the U.S. at various times since March 2018, represents a continuing risk to CPP revenue and operating performance. The United States entered into what is described as “Phase 1” trade agreement with China on January 15, 2020, which reduces some existing tariffs that had been imposed and defers proposed increases of the tariff rate on an additional $250 billion of Chinese goods from 25% to 30% that had been planned for October 15, 2019, and proposed 15% tariffs on an additional $160 billion of a wide range of goods and materials imported from China to be effective December 15, 2019.  Under the Phase 1 agreement, existing 25% tariffs previously imposed on $250 billion of Chinese goods will remain in place, while a 15% tariff on another $120 billion of Chinese goods has been reduced to 7.5%.  In response, China has imposed tariffs on certain U.S. products, some of which are being reduced as part of the Phase 1 agreement. China may take additional actions if additional U.S. tariffs are reduced or imposed.  On May 8, 2020, the two countries reaffirmed their Phase 1 trade agreement notwithstanding the COVID-19 pandemic. In view of potential discussions between the Chinese and U.S. governments on a second phase agreement, for which discussions only among trade negotiators are currently scheduled, the ultimate level of tariffs, the ultimate scope of them, and whether or how the proposed additional tariffs will impact our business is uncertain.  The imposition of additional tariffs by the U.S. government on various steel and aluminum finished goods, as well as a variety of resins, fabrics and wood products could materially affect our operations. As a result of these tariffs and the fluid nature of ongoing trade negotiations, we intend to continue to manage our China supply base, which may include raising prices on certain goods. This may in turn result in reduced sales or the loss of customers and could impact our operating performance.The continuing political and economic conflicts between U.S. and China have resulted in and may continue to cause retaliatory policies from both countries, including a recent executive order issued by the U.S. President eliminating the preferential trade status of Hong Kong in response to China’s action to impose new security measures and regulation on Hong Kong. We cannot predict what new and additional retaliatory policies and regulations may be implemented by the Chinese government in response to U.S. actions, and such policies and regulations may adversely affect our business operations in China.CPP and HBP operations are also subject to the effects of international trade agreements and regulations such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, and the activities and regulations of the World Trade Organization. Although these trade agreements generally have positive effects on trade liberalization, sourcing flexibility and cost of goods by reducing or eliminating the duties 21and/or quotas assessed on products manufactured in a particular country, trade agreements can also adversely affect CPP and HBP businesses. For example, trade agreements can result in setting quotas on products that may be imported from a particular country into key markets including the U.S., Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom, or may make it easier for other companies to compete by eliminating restrictions on products from countries where CPP and HBP competitors source products.The ability of CPP and HBP to import products in a timely and cost-effective manner may also be affected by conditions at ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers, such as port and shipping capacity, labor disputes, severe weather or increased homeland security requirements in the U.S. and other countries, as well as the potential for increased costs due to currency exchange fluctuations. These issues could delay importation of products or require CPP and HBP to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to customers. These alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher transit costs, which could have an adverse impact on CPP and HBP business and financial condition.Griffon’s businesses are subject to seasonal variations and the impact of uncertain weather patterns. Griffon's revenue and earnings are generally lowest in our first and fourth quarters ending December 31, and September 30, respectively, and highest in the second and third quarters ending March 31, and June 30, respectively, primarily due to the seasonality of the AMES business.  In 2020, 53% of AMES' sales occurred during the second and third quarters compared to 56% and 57% in 2019 and 2018, respectively.   In 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, sales orders shifted somewhat into the third and fourth quarters resulting in revenue increasing in these two quarters to 55% of 2020 sales.  Clopay’s business is driven by residential renovation and construction, which occurs more during warm weather, than during the winter months, and so revenues and earnings of Clopay are generally lower in the second quarter.  Telephonics historically has had higher revenue and earnings in the second half of Griffon's fiscal year ending September 30 (although this has not always been the case).Demand for lawn and garden products is influenced by weather, particularly weekend weather during the peak gardening season. AMES' sales volumes could be adversely affected by certain weather patterns such as unseasonably cool or warm temperatures, hurricanes, water shortages or floods. In addition, lack of snow or lower than average snowfall during the winter season may result in reduced sales of certain AMES' products such as snow shovels and other snow tools. As a result, AMES' results of operations, financial results and cash flows could be adversely impacted.Unionized employees could strike or participate in a work stoppage. At September 30, 2020, Griffon employed approximately 7,400 people on a full-time basis, approximately 6% of whom are covered by collective bargaining or similar labor agreements (all within Telephonics and CPP). If unionized employees engage in a strike or other work stoppage, or if Griffon is unable to negotiate acceptable extensions of agreements with labor unions, a significant disruption of operations and increased operating costs could occur. In addition, any renegotiation or renewal of labor agreements could result in higher wages or benefits paid to unionized employees, which could increase operating costs and as a result have a material adverse effect on profitability.   Telephonics’ business depends heavily upon government contracts and, therefore, the defense budget. Telephonics sells products to the U.S. government and its agencies both directly and indirectly as a first-tier supplier to prime contractors in the defense industry such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Northrop Grumman. In the year ended September 30, 2020, U.S. government contracts and subcontracts accounted for approximately 10% of Griffon’s consolidated revenue. Contracts involving the U.S. government may include various risks, including: •Termination for default or for convenience by the government;•Reduction or modification in the event of changes in the government’s requirements or budgetary constraints;•Increased or unexpected costs, causing losses or reduced profits under contracts where Telephonics’ prices are fixed, or determinations that certain costs are not allowable under particular government contracts;•The failure or inability of the prime contractor to perform its contract under circumstances in which Telephonics is a subcontractor;•Failure to observe and comply with government  and procurement regulations such that Telephonics could be suspended or barred from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts;•The failure of the government to exercise options for additional work provided for in contracts;•The inherent discretion of government agencies in determining whether Telephonics has complied with all specifications set forth in a government contract; and•The government’s right, in certain circumstances, to freely use technology developed under these contracts.22Telephonics’ U.S. Government end-user contracts contain a termination for convenience clause, regardless if Telephonics is the prime contractor or the subcontractor. This clause generally entitles Telephonics, upon a termination for convenience, to receive the purchase price for delivered items, reimbursement of allowable work-in-process costs, and an allowance for profit. Allowable costs would include the costs to terminate existing agreements with suppliers. The programs in which Telephonics participate may extend for several years, and may be funded on an incremental basis. Decreases in the U.S. defense budget, in particular with respect to programs to which Telephonics supplies materials, could have a material adverse impact on Telephonics' financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows. The U.S. government may not continue to fund programs to which Telephonics’ development projects apply. Even if funding is continued, Telephonics may fail to compete successfully to obtain funding pursuant to such programs. Reductions to funding on existing programs or delays in the funding of new opportunities could affect the timing of revenue recognition, and impact Telephonics' and Griffon's results of operations.Telephonics’ business could be adversely affected by a government shutdown The impact of a government shutdown for any duration could have a material adverse effect on Telephonics’ revenues, profits and cash flows. Telephonics relies on government personnel to conduct routine business processes related to the inspection and delivery of products for various programs, to approve and pay certain billings and invoices, to process export licenses and for other administrative services that, if disrupted, could have an immediate impact on Telephonics’ business. Telephonics’ business could be adversely affected by a negative audit by the U.S. Government As a government contractor, and a subcontractor to government contractors, Telephonics is subject to audits and investigations by U.S. Government Agencies such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Defense Security Service, with respect to its classified contracts, other Inspectors General and the Department of Justice. These agencies review a contractor’s performance under its contracts, its cost structure and compliance with applicable laws and standards as well as compliance with applicable regulations, including those relating to facility and personnel security clearances. These agencies also review the adequacy of, and a contractor’s compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the contractor’s management, purchasing, property, estimating, compensation, and accounting and information systems. Any costs found to be misclassified or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed, or must be refunded if already billed and collected. Griffon could incur significant expenses in complying with audits and subpoenas issued by the government in aid of inquiries and investigations. If an audit or an investigation uncovers a failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, or improper or illegal activities, Telephonics may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and/or administrative sanctions, which could include contract termination, forfeiture of profit, suspension of payments, fines, including treble damages, and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. Government. In addition, if allegations of impropriety are made, Telephonics and Griffon could suffer serious harm to their reputation. Many Telephonics contracts contain performance obligations that require innovative design capabilities, are technologically complex, or are dependent upon factors not wholly within Telephonics' control. Failure to meet these obligations could adversely affect customer relations, future business opportunities, and overall profitability. Telephonics designs, develops and manufactures advanced and innovative surveillance and communication products for a broad range of applications for use in varying environments. As with many of Telephonics' programs, system specifications, operational requirements and test requirements are challenging, exacerbated by the need for quick delivery schedules. Technical problems encountered and delays in the development or delivery of such products, as well as the inherent discretion involved in government approval related to compliance with applicable specifications of products supplied under government contracts, could prevent Telephonics from meeting contractual obligations, which could subject Telephonics to termination for default. Under a termination for default, the company is entitled to negotiate payment for undelivered work if the Government requests the transfer of title and delivery of partially completed supplies and materials. Conversely, if the Government does not make this request, there is no obligation to reimburse the company for its costs incurred. Telephonics may also be subject to the repayment of advance and progress payments, if any. Additionally, Telephonics may be liable to the Government for any of its excess costs incurred in acquiring supplies and services similar to those terminated for default, and for other damages. Should any of the foregoing events occur, it could result in a material adverse effect on Griffon's financial position.Griffon's business could be negatively affected by cyber or other security threats or other disruptions.Griffon and its operating companies are subjected to cyber and other security threats common to U.S. businesses. As a U.S. defense contractor, Telephonics, in particular, may be the target of cyber security threats to its information technology infrastructure and unauthorized attempts to gain access to sensitive or highly confidential information that could compromise U.S. security.  The 23types of threats could vary from attacks common to most industries to more advanced and persistent, highly organized adversaries who target Telephonics because of national security information in its possession. Individuals and groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including organizations sponsored by foreign countries, may use a wide variety of methods, such as deploying malicious software or exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware, software, or other infrastructure in order to gain access to our networks or using social engineering techniques to induce our employees to disclose passwords or other sensitive information or take other actions to gain access to our data. Inadequate account security practices may also result in unauthorized access to confidential data. For example, system administrators may fail to timely remove employee account access when no longer appropriate. Employees or third parties may also intentionally compromise our systems, security or confidential information. If Telephonics is unable to protect sensitive information, its customers or governmental authorities could question the adequacy of its security processes and procedures and its compliance with evolving government cyber security requirements for government contractors. Due to the evolving nature of these security threats, and the increasing difficulty of detecting and defending against them, the risk and impact of any future incident cannot be predicted.The costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions could be significant.  Security events such as these could adversely affect Griffon's internal operations, future financial results and reputation, as well as result in the loss of competitive advantages derived from research and development efforts and other intellectual property.Griffon may be unable to implement its acquisition growth strategy, which may result in added expenses without a commensurate increase in revenue and income, and divert management’s attention.Making strategic acquisitions is a significant part of Griffon’s growth plans. The ability to successfully complete acquisitions depends on identifying and acquiring, on acceptable terms, companies that either complement or enhance currently held businesses or expand Griffon into new profitable businesses, and, for certain acquisitions, obtaining financing on acceptable terms. Additionally, Griffon must properly integrate acquired businesses in order to maximize profitability. The competition for acquisition candidates is intense and Griffon cannot assure that it will successfully identify acquisition candidates and complete acquisitions at reasonable purchase prices, in a timely manner, or at all. Further, there is a risk that acquisitions will not be properly integrated into Griffon’s existing structure. Griffon closed the acquisitions of La Hacienda, Tuscan Path, ClosetMaid and Harper Brush in the months of July through November 2017, Kelkay in February 2018, CornellCookson in June 2018 and Apta in November 2019. This integration risk may be exacerbated when numerous acquisitions are consummated in a short time period.In implementing an acquisition growth strategy, the following may be encountered:•Costs associated with incomplete or poorly implemented acquisitions;•Expenses, delays and difficulties of integrating acquired companies into Griffon’s existing organization;•Dilution of the interest of existing stockholders;•Diversion of management’s attention; or•Difficulty in obtaining financing on acceptable terms, or at all.An unsuccessful implementation of Griffon’s acquisition growth strategy, including the failure to properly integrate acquisitions, could have an adverse impact on Griffon’s results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. We may also incur debt or assume contingent liabilities in connection with acquisitions, which could impose restrictions on our business operations and harm our operating results.Risks Related to Our IndebtednessWhile Griffon’s senior notes, which have limited covenants, are not due until 2028, and while its $400 million revolving line of credit, which is largely undrawn and has greater covenant requirements, does not mature until 2025, there are potential impacts from Griffon’s use of debt to finance certain of its activities, especially acquisitions and expansions, as set forth below.24Compliance with restrictions and covenants in Griffon’s debt agreements may limit its ability to take corporate actions.The credit agreement entered into by, and, to a lesser extent, the terms of the senior notes issued by, Griffon each contain covenants that restrict the ability of Griffon and its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional debt, pay dividends, incur liens and make investments, acquisitions, dispositions, restricted payments and capital expenditures. Under the credit agreement, which is largely undrawn, Griffon is also required to comply with specific financial ratios and tests. Griffon may not be able to comply in the future with these covenants or restrictions as a result of events beyond its control, such as prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions or a change in control of Griffon. If Griffon defaults in maintaining compliance with the covenants and restrictions in its credit agreement or the senior notes, its lenders could declare all of the principal and interest amounts outstanding due and payable and, in the case of the credit agreement, terminate the commitments to extend credit to Griffon in the future. If Griffon or its subsidiaries are unable to secure credit in the future, its business could be harmed.Griffon may be unable to raise additional financing if needed.Griffon may need to raise additional financing in the future in order to implement its business plan, refinance debt, or acquire new or complimentary businesses or assets. Any required additional financing may be unavailable, or only available at unfavorable terms, due to uncertainties in the credit markets. If Griffon raises additional funds by issuing equity securities, current holders of its common stock may experience significant ownership interest dilution and the holders of the new securities may have rights senior to the rights associated with current outstanding common stock.Griffon’s indebtedness and interest expense could limit cash flow and adversely affect operations and Griffon’s ability to make full payment on outstanding debt.Griffon’s indebtedness poses potential risks such as:•A substantial portion of cash flows from operations could be used to pay principal and interest on debt, thereby reducing the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, product development and other general corporate purposes;•Insufficient cash flows from operations may force Griffon to sell assets, or seek additional capital, which Griffon may not be able to secure on favorable terms, if at all; and•Its level of indebtedness may make Griffon more vulnerable to economic or industry downturns.Risk Related to Our Common StockGriffon has the ability to issue additional equity securities, which would lead to dilution of issued and outstanding common stock.The issuance of additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities would result in dilution to existing stockholders’ equity interests. Griffon is authorized to issue, without stockholder vote or approval, 3,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series, and has the ability to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of any such series. Any such series of preferred stock could contain dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices, liquidation preferences or other rights superior to the rights of holders of Griffon’s common stock.  While there is no present intention of issuing any such preferred stock, Griffon reserves the right to do so at any time. In addition, Griffon is authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, up to 85,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 56,129,784 shares, net of treasury shares, were outstanding as of September 30, 2020. Additionally, Griffon is authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, securities convertible into either shares of common stock or preferred stock.General Risk Factors
Each of Griffon's businesses faces risks related to the disruption of its primary manufacturing facilities.The manufacturing facilities for each of Griffon's businesses are concentrated in just a few locations, and in the case of CPP, some of these locations are abroad in low-cost locations. Any of Griffon's manufacturing facilities are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, such as natural or man-made disasters, pandemics, terrorist activities, disruptions of information technology resources, and utility interruptions. Such disruptions may cause delays in shipping products, which could result in the loss of business or customer trust, adversely affecting Griffon’s businesses and operating results.25Manufacturing capacity constraints or increased manufacturing costs may have a material adverse effect on Griffon's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Griffon’s current manufacturing resources may be inadequate to meet significantly increased demand for some of its products. Griffon’s ability to increase its manufacturing capacity depends on many factors, including the availability of capital, steadily increasing consumer demand, equipment delivery, construction lead-times, installation, qualification, and permitting and other regulatory requirements. Increasing capacity through the use of third-party manufacturers may depend on Griffon’s ability to develop and maintain such relationships and the ability of such third parties to devote additional capacity to fill its orders.A lack of sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand could cause customer service levels to decrease, which may negatively affect customer demand for Griffon's products and customer relations generally, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on Griffon's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, operating facilities at or near capacity may also increase production and distribution costs and negatively impact relations with employees or contractors, which could result in disruptions to operations.In addition, manufacturing costs may increase significantly and Griffon may not be able to successfully recover these cost increases with increased pricing to its customers.If CPP and HBP do not continue to develop and maintain leading brands or realize the anticipated benefits of advertising and promotion spend, its operating results may suffer.The ability of CPP and HBP to compete successfully depends in part on the company’s ability to develop and maintain leading brands so that retail and other customers will need its products to meet consumer demand. Leading brands allow both CPP and HBP to realize economies of scale in its operations. The development and maintenance of such brands require significant investment in brand-building and marketing initiatives. While CPP and HBP plan to continue to increase its expenditures for advertising and promotion and other brand-building and marketing initiatives over the long term, the initiatives may not deliver the anticipated results and the results of such initiatives may not cover the costs of the increased investment. Griffon may be required to record impairment charges for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.Griffon is required to assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually for impairment or on an interim basis if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest impairment exists. If impairment testing indicates that the carrying value of reporting units or indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds the respective fair value, an impairment charge would be recognized. If goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets were to become impaired, the results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.If Griffon's subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform their obligations, Griffon's performance and ability to win future business could be harmed.Griffon relies on other companies to provide materials, major components and products to fulfill contractual obligations. Such arrangements may involve subcontracts, teaming arrangements, or supply agreements with other companies. There is a risk that Griffon may have disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed. In addition, changes in the economic environment, including defense budgets and constraints on available financing, may adversely affect the financial stability of Griffon's supply chain and their ability to meet their performance requirements or to provide needed supplies on a timely basis. A disruption or failure of any supplier could have an adverse effect on Griffon's business resulting in an impact to profitability, possible termination of a contract, imposition of fines or penalties, and harm to Griffon's reputation impacting its ability to secure future business.Griffon’s companies must continually improve existing products, design and sell new products and invest in research and development in order to compete effectively. The markets for Griffon’s products are characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and continuous improvements in products. Due to constant changes in Griffon's markets, future success depends on Griffon's ability to develop new technologies, products, processes and product applications.  Griffon's long-term success in the competitive retail environment and the industrial and commercial markets depends on its ability to develop and commercialize a continuing stream of innovative new products that are appealing to ultimate end users and create demand. New product development and commercialization efforts, including efforts to enter markets or product categories in which Griffon has limited or no prior experience, have inherent risks. These risks include the costs involved, such as development and commercialization, product development or launch delays, and 26the failure of new products and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance or growth in sales or operating income.Griffon also faces the risk that its competitors will introduce innovative new products that compete with Griffon’s products.  In addition, sales generated by new products could cause a decline in sales of Griffon’s other existing products. If new product development and commercialization efforts are not successful, Griffon’s financial results could be adversely affected.Product and technological developments are accomplished both through internally-funded R&D projects, as well as through strategic partnerships with customers. Because it is not generally possible to predict the amount of time required and costs involved in achieving certain R&D objectives, actual development costs may exceed budgeted amounts and estimated product development schedules may be extended. Griffon’s financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if: •Product improvements are not completed on a timely basis;•New products are not introduced on a timely basis or do not achieve sufficient market penetration;•There are budget overruns or delays in R&D efforts; or•New products experience reliability or quality problems, or otherwise do not meet customer preferences or requirements. The loss of certain key officers or employees could adversely affect Griffon’s business. The success of Griffon is materially dependent upon the continued services of certain key officers and employees. The loss of such key personnel could have a material adverse effect on Griffon’s operating results or financial condition. Griffon is exposed to a variety of risks relating to non-U.S. sales and operations, including non-U.S. economic and political conditions and fluctuations in exchange rates.Griffon and its companies conduct operations in Canada, Australasia, the United Kingdom, Mexico and China, and sell their products in many countries around the world. Sales of products through non-U.S. subsidiaries accounted for approximately 17% of consolidated revenue for the year ended September 30, 2020. These sales could be adversely affected by changes in political and economic conditions, trade protection measures, such as tariffs, the ability of the Company to enter into industrial cooperation agreements (offset agreements), differing intellectual property rights and laws and changes in regulatory requirements that restrict the sales of products or increase costs in such locations. Enforcement of existing laws in such jurisdictions can be uncertain, and the lack of a sophisticated body of laws can create various uncertainties, including with respect to customer and supplier contracts. Currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in the non-U.S. regions in which Griffon does business may also have an impact on future reported financial results.Griffon's international sales and operations are subject to applicable laws relating to trade, export controls and foreign corrupt practices, the violation of which could adversely affect operations. Griffon is subject to various anti-corruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. In addition, Griffon is subject to export controls, laws and regulations such as the Arms Export Control Act, the International Traffic in Arms Regulation and the Export Administration Regulations, as well as to economic sanctions, laws and embargoes imposed by various governments or organizations, including the U.S. and the European Union or member countries. Violations of anti-corruption, export controls or sanctions laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties, including debarment, loss of export privileges and loss of authorizations needed to conduct Griffon's international business, and could harm the ability to enter into contracts with the U.S. Government. Such violations could also result in Griffon being subject to other liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on Griffon's business, results of operations and financial condition.Griffon may not be able to protect its proprietary rights. Griffon relies on a combination of patent, copyright and trademark laws, common law, trade secrets, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions to protect proprietary rights. Such measures do not provide absolute protection and Griffon cannot give assurance that measures for protecting these proprietary rights are and will be adequate, or that competitors will not independently develop similar technologies. Griffon may inadvertently infringe on, or may be accused of infringing on, proprietary rights held by another party. Griffon is regularly improving its technology and employing existing technologies in new ways. Though Griffon takes reasonable precautions to ensure it does not infringe on the rights of others, it is possible that Griffon may inadvertently infringe on, or be accused of infringing on, proprietary rights held by others. If Griffon is found to have infringed on the propriety rights held by 27others, any related litigation or settlement relating to such infringement may have a material effect on Griffon’s business, results of operations and financial condition. Griffon is exposed to product liability and warranty claims. Griffon is subject to product liability and warranty claims in the ordinary course of business, including with respect to former businesses now included within discontinued operations. These claims relate to the conformity of its products with required specifications, and to alleged or actual defects in Griffon’s products (or in end-products in which Griffon’s products were a component part) that cause damage to property or persons. There can be no assurance that the frequency and severity of product liability claims brought against Griffon will not increase, which claims can be brought either by an injured customer of an end product manufacturer who used one of Griffon's products as a component or by a direct purchaser. There is also no assurance that the number and value of warranty claims will not increase as compared to historical claim rates, or that Griffon's warranty reserve at any particular time is sufficient. No assurance can be given that indemnification from customers or coverage under insurance policies will be adequate to cover future product liability claims against Griffon; for example, product liability insurance typically does not cover claims for punitive damages. Warranty claims are typically not covered by insurance at all. Product liability insurance can be expensive, difficult to maintain and may be unobtainable in the future on acceptable terms. The amount and scope of any insurance coverage may be inadequate if a product liability claim is successfully asserted. Furthermore, if any significant claims are made, the business and the related financial condition of Griffon may be adversely affected by negative publicity. Griffon has been, and may in the future be, subject to claims and liabilities under environmental laws and regulations.Griffon’s operations and assets are subject to environmental laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment, the handling and disposal of wastes, including solid and hazardous wastes, and otherwise relating to health, safety and protection of the environment, in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Griffon does not expect to make any expenditure with respect to ongoing compliance with or remediation under these environmental laws and regulations that would have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results or financial condition. However, the applicable requirements under environmental laws and regulations may change at any time. Griffon can incur environmental costs related to sites that are no longer owned or operated, as well as third-party sites to which hazardous materials are sent. Material expenditures or liabilities may be incurred in connection with such claims. See the Commitment and Contingencies footnote in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on environmental contingencies. Based on facts presently known, the outcome of current environmental matters are not expected to have a material adverse effect on Griffon’s results of operations and financial condition. However, presently unknown environmental conditions, changes in environmental laws and regulations or other unanticipated events may give rise to claims that may involve material expenditures or liabilities. Changes in income tax laws and regulations or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect profitability.Griffon is subject to Federal, state and local income taxes in the U.S. and in various taxing jurisdictions outside the U.S. Tax provisions and liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various U.S. and international tax jurisdictions. Griffon’s effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in any valuation allowance for deferred tax assets or the amendment or enactment of tax laws. The amount of income taxes paid is subject to audits by U.S. Federal, state and local tax authorities, as well as tax authorities in the taxing jurisdictions outside the U.S. If such audits result in assessments different from recorded income tax liabilities, Griffon’s future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to its income tax provision"
9,GFF,GRIFFON CORP,2019-11-22,"Risk Factors
 Griffon’s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors which could cause Griffon’s actual results to vary materially from recent or anticipated future results. The risk factors discussed in this section should be carefully considered with all of the information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risk factors should not be considered the only risk factors facing Griffon. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that are currently deemed immaterial may also materially impact Griffon’s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows in the future. In general, Griffon is subject to the same general risks and uncertainties that impact other diverse manufacturing companies including, but not limited to, general economic, industry and/or market conditions and growth rates; impact of natural disasters and their effect on global markets; possible future terrorist threats and their effect on the worldwide economy; and changes in laws or accounting rules. Griffon has identified the following specific risks and uncertainties that it believes have the potential to materially affect its business and financial condition. Current worldwide economic uncertainty and market volatility could adversely affect Griffon’s businesses. The current worldwide economic uncertainty and market volatility could continue to have an adverse effect on Griffon during 2020, particularly within  the CPP and HBP segments, which is linked to the U.S. housing and the commercial property markets, and the U.S. economy in general.   Purchases of many CPP and HBP products are discretionary for consumers who are generally more willing to purchase products during periods in which favorable macroeconomic conditions prevail. Additionally, the current condition of the credit markets could impact Griffon’s ability to refinance expiring debt or obtain additional credit on favorable terms for investments in current businesses or for acquisitions, or may render financing unavailable. Griffon is also exposed to certain fundamental economic risks including a decrease in the demand for the products and services it offers or a higher likelihood of default on its receivables. Adverse trends and general economic conditions, especially those that relate to construction and renovation, will impact Griffon’s business.The CPP and HBP businesses serve residential and commercial construction and renovation, and are influenced by market conditions that affect these industries. For the year ended September 30, 2019,  approximately 45% and 40% of Griffon’s consolidated revenue was derived from the CPP and HBP segments, respectively, which was dependent on renovation of existing homes, new home construction, and commercial non-residential construction, repair and replacement. The strength of the U.S. economy, the age of existing home stock, job growth, interest rates, consumer confidence and the availability of consumer credit, as well as demographic factors such as migration into the U.S. and migration of the population within the U.S., have an effect on CPP and HBP.  To the extent market conditions for residential or commercial construction and renovation are weaker than expected, this will likely have an adverse impact on the performance and financial results of the CPP and HBP businesses.Griffon operates in highly competitive industries and may be unable to compete effectively. Griffon’s operating companies face intense competition in the markets they serve. Griffon competes primarily on the basis of technical expertise, product differentiation, quality of products and services, and price. There are a number of competitors to Griffon, some of which are larger and have greater resources than Griffon’s operating companies. Griffon's operating companies may face additional competition from companies that operate in countries with significantly lower operating costs.  Many CPP and HBP customers are large mass merchandisers, such as home centers, warehouse clubs,  discount stores, commercial distributors and e-commerce companies. The growing share of the market represented by these large mass merchandisers, together with changes in consumer shopping patterns, have contributed to the increase of  multi-category retailers and e-commerce companies that have strong negotiating power with suppliers. Many of these retailers import products directly from foreign suppliers to source and sell products under their own private label brands to compete with CPP and HBP products and brands, which puts increasing price pressure on the products of these businesses. In addition, the intense competition in the retail and e-commerce sectors, combined with the overall increasingly competitive economic environment, may result in a number of customers experiencing financial difficulty, or failing in the future. The loss of, or a failure by, one of CPP or HBP customers could adversely impact our sales and operating cash flows. To address all of these challenges, CPP and HBP must be able to respond to these competitive pressures, and the failure to respond effectively could result in a loss of sales, reduced profitability and a limited ability to recover cost increases through price increases. In addition, there can be no assurance that Griffon will not encounter increased competition in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on Griffon’s financial results.16The loss of large customers can harm financial results. A small number of customers account for, and are expected to continue to account for, a substantial portion of Griffon's consolidated revenue.  Home Depot, Lowe’s and Bunnings are significant customers of CPP, and Home Depot and Menards are significant customers of HBP.  Home Depot accounted for approximately 18% of consolidated revenue, 28% of CPP's revenue and 13% HBP's revenue for the year ended September 30, 2019. The U.S. Government and its agencies and subcontractors, including Lockheed Martin and Boeing, is a significant customer of Telephonics, and together accounts for approximately 10% of consolidated revenue and 63% of Defense Electronics segment revenue (Lockheed Martin and Boeing each individually represent less than 10% of consolidated revenue inclusive of such sales to the U.S. Government). Future operating results will continue to substantially depend on the success of Griffon’s largest customers, as well as Griffon’s relationships with them. Orders from these customers are subject to fluctuation and may be reduced materially due to changes in customer needs or other factors. Any reduction or delay in sales of products to one or more of these customers could significantly reduce Griffon’s revenue. Griffon’s operating results will also depend on successfully developing relationships with additional key customers. Griffon cannot assure that its largest customers will be retained or that additional key customers will be recruited. Also, both CPP and HBP extend credit to its customers, which exposes it to credit risk.  The largest customer accounted for approximately 20%, 8% and 12% of the net accounts receivable of CPP, HBP and Griffon’s net accounts receivable as of September 30, 2019, respectively. If this customer were to become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay its debts, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of CPP, HBP and Griffon could be adversely affected.Reliance on third party suppliers and manufacturers may impair CPP and HBP ability to meet its customer demands. CPP and HBP rely on a limited number of domestic and foreign companies to supply components and manufacture certain of its products. The percentage of CPP and HBP worldwide sourced finished goods as a percent of revenue approximated 32% and 8%, respectively, in 2019. The percentage of CPP and HBP's worldwide sourced components as a percent of cost of goods sold approximated 12% and 16%, respectively, in 2019. Reliance on third party suppliers and manufacturers may reduce control over the timing of deliveries and quality of both CPP and HBP products. Reduced product quality or failure to deliver products timely may jeopardize relationships with certain of CPP and HBP key customers. In addition, reliance on third party suppliers or manufacturers may result in the failure to meet CPP and HBP customer demands. Continued turbulence in the worldwide economy may affect the liquidity and financial condition of CPP and HBP suppliers. Should any of these parties fail to manufacture sufficient supply, go out of business or discontinue a particular component, alternative suppliers may not be found in a timely manner, if at all. Such events could impact the ability of  CPP and HBP to fill orders, which could have a material adverse effect on customer relationships. If Griffon is unable to obtain raw materials for products at favorable prices it could adversely impact operating performance. CPP and HBP suppliers primarily provide resin, wood, steel and wire rod.  Both of these businesses could experience shortages of raw materials or components for products or be forced to seek alternative sources of supply. If temporary shortages due to disruptions in supply caused by weather, transportation, production delays or other factors require raw materials to be secured from sources other than current suppliers, the terms may not be as favorable as current terms or certain materials may not be available at all. In recent years, both CPP and HBP have experienced price increases in steel and plastic resins. While most key raw materials used in Griffon’s businesses are generally available from numerous sources, raw materials are subject to price fluctuations. Because raw materials in the aggregate constitute a significant component of the cost of goods sold, price fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on Griffon’s results of operations. Griffon’s ability to pass raw material price increases to customers is limited due to supply arrangements and competitive pricing pressure, and there is generally a time lag between increased raw material costs and implementation of corresponding price increases for Griffon’s products. In particular, sharp increases in raw material prices are more difficult to pass through to customers and may negatively affect short-term financial performance.CPP is subject to risks from sourcing from international locations, especially China CPP' business is global, with products and raw materials sourced from, manufactured in and sold in multiple countries around the world. There are risks associated with conducting a business that may be impacted by political and other developments associated with international trade. In this regard, certain products sold by CPP in the United States and elsewhere are sourced from China; and raw materials used by CPP may be sourced from China and therefore may have their prices impacted by tariffs imposed on trade between the United States and China. 17The sourcing of CPP finished goods, components and raw materials from China are generally subject to supply agreements with Chinese companies. China does not have a well-developed, consolidated body of laws governing agreements with international customers. Enforcement of existing laws or contracts based on existing law may be uncertain and sporadic, and it may be difficult to obtain swift and equitable enforcement or to obtain enforcement of a judgment by a court of another jurisdiction. The relative inexperience of China’s judiciary on matters of international trade in many cases creates additional uncertainty as to the outcome of any litigation. In addition, interpretation of statutes and regulations in China may be subject to government policies reflecting domestic political changes. Because of the volume of sourcing by CPP from China, the ongoing trade dispute between the U.S. and China, including the imposition of tariffs on various Chinese imports into the U.S. at various times since March 2018, represents a continuing risk to CPP revenue and operating performance. Following the initial announcement in March 2018 of a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum imports, the Trump Administration imposed additional and/or increased tariffs on a wide variety of consumer and industrial items imported from China throughout the remainder of 2018 and 2019 to date. Some of these tariffs were subsequently reduced and/or delayed as the Trump Administration continues to pursue trade negotiations with China.  The materials subject to these  tariffs include various steel and aluminum finished goods, as well as a variety of resins, fabrics and wood products. As a result of these tariffs  and the fluid nature of ongoing trade negotiations, we intend to continue to manage our China supply base, which may include raising  prices on certain goods. This may in turn result in reduced sales or the loss of customers and could impact our operating performance. CPP and HBP operations are also subject to the effects of international trade agreements and regulations such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, and the activities and regulations of the World Trade Organization. Although these trade agreements generally have positive effects on trade liberalization, sourcing flexibility and cost of goods by reducing or eliminating the duties and/or quotas assessed on products manufactured in a particular country, trade agreements can also adversely affect CPP and HBP businesses. For example, trade agreements can result in setting quotas on products that may be imported from a particular country into key markets including the U.S., Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom, or may make it easier for other companies to compete by eliminating restrictions on products from countries where CPP and HBP competitors source products. The ability of CPP and HBP to import products in a timely and cost-effective manner may also be affected by conditions at ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers, such as port and shipping capacity, labor disputes, severe weather or increased homeland security requirements in the U.S. and other countries. These issues could delay importation of products or require CPP and HBP to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to customers. These alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher transit costs, which could have an adverse impact on CPP and HBP business and financial condition.Griffon’s businesses are subject to seasonal variations and the impact of uncertain weather patterns. Historically, overall Griffon revenue and earnings are lower in the first and second quarters ending December 31 and March 31, respectively and higher in the third and fourth quarters ending June 30 and September 30, respectively.  Griffon's revenue and earnings are generally lowest in our first and fourth quarters ending December 31, and September 30, respectively, and highest in the second and third quarters ending March 31, and June 30, respectively, primarily due to the seasonality of the AMES business.  In 2019, 56% of AMES' sales occurred during the second and third quarters.  Clopay’s business is driven by residential renovation and construction, which occurs more during warm weather, than during the winter months, and so revenues and earnings of Clopay are generally lower in the second quarter.  Telephonics historically has had higher revenue and earnings in the second half of Griffon's fiscal year ending September 30 (although this has not always been the case).Demand for lawn and garden products is influenced by weather, particularly weekend weather during the peak gardening season. AMES' sales volumes could be adversely affected by certain weather patterns such as unseasonably cool or warm temperatures, hurricanes, water shortages or floods. In addition, lack of snow or lower than average snowfall during the winter season may result in reduced sales of certain AMES' products such as snow shovels and other snow tools. As a result, AMES' results of operations, financial results and cash flows could be adversely impacted.Each of Griffon's businesses faces risks related to the disruption of its primary manufacturing facilities.The manufacturing facilities for each of Griffon's businesses are concentrated in just a few locations, and in the case of CPP, some of these locations are abroad in low-cost locations. Any of Griffon's manufacturing facilities are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, such as natural or man-made disasters, terrorist activities, disruptions of information technology resources, and utility interruptions. Such disruptions may cause delays in shipping products, which could result in the loss of business or customer trust, adversely affecting Griffon’s businesses and operating results.18Manufacturing capacity constraints or increased manufacturing costs may have a material adverse effect on Griffon's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Griffon’s current manufacturing resources may be inadequate to meet significantly increased demand for some of its products. Griffon’s ability to increase its manufacturing capacity depends on many factors, including the availability of capital, steadily increasing consumer demand, equipment delivery, construction lead-times, installation, qualification, and permitting and other regulatory requirements. Increasing capacity through the use of third-party manufacturers may depend on Griffon’s ability to develop and maintain such relationships and the ability of such third parties to devote additional capacity to fill its orders.A lack of sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand could cause customer service levels to decrease, which may negatively affect customer demand for Griffon's products and customer relations generally, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on Griffon's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, operating facilities at or near capacity may also increase production and distribution costs and negatively impact relations with employees or contractors, which could result in disruptions to operations.In addition, manufacturing costs may increase significantly and Griffon may not be able to successfully recover these cost increases with increased pricing to its customers.If CPP and HBP do not continue to develop and maintain leading brands or realize the anticipated benefits of advertising and promotion spend, its operating results may suffer.The ability of CPP and HBP to compete successfully depends in part on the company’s ability to develop and maintain leading brands so that retail and other customers will need its products to meet consumer demand. Leading brands allow both CPP and HBP to realize economies of scale in its operations. The development and maintenance of such brands require significant investment in brand-building and marketing initiatives. While CPP and HBP plan to continue to increase its expenditures for advertising and promotion and other brand-building and marketing initiatives over the long term, the initiatives may not deliver the anticipated results and the results of such initiatives may not cover the costs of the increased investment.Unionized employees could strike or participate in a work stoppage. At September 30, 2019, Griffon employed approximately 7,300 people on a full-time basis, approximately 6% of whom are covered by collective bargaining or similar labor agreements (all within Telephonics and CPP). If unionized employees engage in a strike or other work stoppage, or if Griffon is unable to negotiate acceptable extensions of agreements with labor unions, a significant disruption of operations and increased operating costs could occur. In addition, any renegotiation or renewal of labor agreements could result in higher wages or benefits paid to unionized employees, which could increase operating costs and as a result have a material adverse effect on profitability.  Griffon may be required to record impairment charges for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.Griffon is required to assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually for impairment or on an interim basis if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest impairment exists. If impairment testing indicates that the carrying value of reporting units or indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds the respective fair value, an impairment charge would be recognized. If goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets were to become impaired, the results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.  Telephonics’ business depends heavily upon government contracts and, therefore, the defense budget. Telephonics sells products to the U.S. government and its agencies both directly and indirectly as a first-tier supplier to prime contractors in the defense industry such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Northrop Grumman. In the year ended September 30, 2019, U.S. government contracts and subcontracts accounted for approximately 10% of Griffon’s consolidated revenue. Contracts involving the U.S. government may include various risks, including: •Termination for default or for convenience by the government;•Reduction or modification in the event of changes in the government’s requirements or budgetary constraints;•Increased or unexpected costs, causing losses or reduced profits under contracts where Telephonics’ prices are fixed, or determinations that certain costs are not allowable under particular government contracts;•The failure or inability of the prime contractor to perform its contract under circumstances in which Telephonics is a subcontractor;19•Failure to observe and comply with government business practice and procurement regulations such that Telephonics could be suspended or barred from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts;•The failure of the government to exercise options for additional work provided for in contracts;•The inherent discretion of government agencies in determining whether Telephonics has complied with all specifications set forth in a government contract; and•The government’s right, in certain circumstances, to freely use technology developed under these contracts.All of Telephonics’ U.S. Government end-user contracts contain a termination for convenience clause, regardless if Telephonics is the prime contractor or the subcontractor. This clause generally entitles Telephonics, upon a termination for convenience, to receive the purchase price for delivered items, reimbursement of allowable work-in-process costs, and an allowance for profit. Allowable costs would include the costs to terminate existing agreements with suppliers. The programs in which Telephonics participates may extend for several years, and may be funded on an incremental basis. Decreases in the U.S. defense budget, in particular with respect to programs to which Telephonics supplies materials, could have a material adverse impact on Telephonics' financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows. The U.S. government may not continue to fund programs to which Telephonics’ development projects apply. Even if funding is continued, Telephonics may fail to compete successfully to obtain funding pursuant to such programs. Reductions to funding on existing programs or delays in the funding of new opportunities could affect the timing of revenue recognition, and impact Telephonics' and Griffon's results of operations.Ability of government to fund and conduct its operations The impact of a government shutdown for any duration could have a material adverse effect on Telephonics’ revenues, profits and cash flows. Telephonics relies on government personnel to conduct routine business processes related to the inspection and delivery of products for various programs, to approve and pay certain billings and invoices, to process export licenses and for other administrative services that, if disrupted, could have an immediate impact on Telephonics’ business. Telephonics’ business could be adversely affected by a negative audit by the U.S. Government As a government contractor, and a subcontractor to government contractors, Telephonics is subject to audits and investigations by U.S. Government Agencies such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Defense Security Service, with respect to its classified contracts, other Inspectors General and the Department of Justice. These agencies review a contractor’s performance under its contracts, its cost structure and compliance with applicable laws and standards as well as compliance with applicable regulations, including those relating to facility and personnel security clearances. These agencies also review the adequacy of, and a contractor’s compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the contractor’s management, purchasing, property, estimating, compensation, and accounting and information systems. Any costs found to be misclassified or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed, or must be refunded if already billed and collected. Griffon could incur significant expenses in complying with audits and subpoenas issued by the government in aid of inquiries and investigations. If an audit or an investigation uncovers a failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, or improper or illegal activities, Telephonics may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and/or administrative sanctions, which could include contract termination, forfeiture of profit, suspension of payments, fines, including treble damages, and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. Government. In addition, if allegations of impropriety are made, Telephonics and Griffon could suffer serious harm to their reputation. Many Telephonics contracts contain performance obligations that require innovative design capabilities, are technologically complex, or are dependent upon factors not wholly within Telephonics' control. Failure to meet these obligations could adversely affect customer relations, future business opportunities, and overall profitability. Telephonics designs, develops and manufactures advanced and innovative surveillance and communication products for a broad range of applications for use in varying environments. As with many of Telephonics' programs, system specifications, operational requirements and test requirements are challenging, exacerbated by the need for quick delivery schedules. Technical problems encountered and delays in the development or delivery of such products, as well as the inherent discretion involved in government approval related to compliance with applicable specifications of products supplied under government contracts, could prevent Telephonics from meeting contractual obligations, which could subject Telephonics to termination for default. Under a termination for default, the company is entitled to negotiate payment for undelivered work if the Government requests the transfer of title and delivery of partially completed supplies and materials. Conversely, if the Government does not make this request, there is no obligation to reimburse the company for its costs incurred. Telephonics may also be subject to the repayment of advance and progress payments, if any. Additionally, Telephonics may be liable to the Government for any of its excess costs incurred in acquiring supplies and services similar to those terminated for default, and for other damages. Should any of the foregoing events occur, it could result in a material adverse effect on Griffon's financial position.20Griffon's business could be negatively affected by cyber or other security threats or other disruptions.Overall, Griffon and its operating companies are subjected to cyber and other security threats common to U.S. businesses. As a U.S. defense contractor, Telephonics, in particular, may be the target of cyber security threats to its information technology infrastructure and unauthorized attempts to gain access to sensitive or highly confidential information that could compromise U.S. security.  The types of threats could vary from attacks common to most industries to more advanced and persistent, highly organized adversaries who target Telephonics because of national security information in its possession.  If Telephonics is unable to protect sensitive information, its customers or governmental authorities could question the adequacy of its security processes and procedures and its compliance with evolving government cyber security requirements for government contractors. Due to the evolving nature of these security threats, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted.The costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions could be significant.  Security events such as these could adversely affect Griffon's internal operations, future financial results and reputation, as well as result in the loss of competitive advantages derived from research and development efforts and other intellectual property.If Griffon's subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform their obligations, Griffon's performance and ability to win future business could be harmed.Griffon relies on other companies to provide materials, major components and products to fulfill contractual obligations. Such arrangements may involve subcontracts, teaming arrangements, or supply agreements with other companies. There is a risk that Griffon may have disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed. In addition, changes in the economic environment, including defense budgets and constraints on available financing, may adversely affect the financial stability of Griffon's supply chain and their ability to meet their performance requirements or to provide needed supplies on a timely basis. A disruption or failure of any supplier could have an adverse effect on Griffon's business resulting in an impact to profitability, possible termination of a contract, imposition of fines or penalties, and harm to Griffon's reputation impacting its ability to secure future business.Griffon’s companies must continually improve existing products, design and sell new products and invest in research and development in order to compete effectively. The markets for Griffon’s products are characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and continuous improvements in products. Due to constant changes in Griffon's markets, future success depends on Griffon's ability to develop new technologies, products, processes and product applications.  Griffon's long-term success in the competitive retail environment and the industrial and commercial markets depends on its ability to develop and commercialize a continuing stream of innovative new products that are appealing to ultimate end users and create demand. New product development and commercialization efforts, including efforts to enter markets or product categories in which Griffon has limited or no prior experience, have inherent risks. These risks include the costs involved, such as development and commercialization, product development or launch delays, and the failure of new products and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance or growth in sales or operating income.Griffon also faces the risk that its competitors will introduce innovative new products that compete with Griffon’s products.  In addition, sales generated by new products could cause a decline in sales of Griffon’s other existing products. If new product development and commercialization efforts are not successful, Griffon’s financial results could be adversely affected.Product and technological developments are accomplished both through internally-funded R&D projects, as well as through strategic partnerships with customers. Because it is not generally possible to predict the amount of time required and costs involved in achieving certain R&D objectives, actual development costs may exceed budgeted amounts and estimated product development schedules may be extended. Griffon’s financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if: •Product improvements are not completed on a timely basis;•New products are not introduced on a timely basis or do not achieve sufficient market penetration;•There are budget overruns or delays in R&D efforts; or•New products experience reliability or quality problems, or otherwise do not meet customer preferences or requirements.21Griffon may be unable to implement its acquisition growth strategy, which may result in added expenses without a commensurate increase in revenue and income and divert management’s attention. Making strategic acquisitions is a significant part of Griffon’s growth plans. The ability to successfully complete acquisitions depends on identifying and acquiring, on acceptable terms, companies that either complement or enhance currently held businesses or expand Griffon into new profitable businesses, and, for certain acquisitions, obtaining financing on acceptable terms. Additionally, Griffon must properly integrate acquired businesses in order to maximize profitability. The competition for acquisition candidates is intense and Griffon cannot assure that it will successfully identify acquisition candidates and complete acquisitions at reasonable purchase prices, in a timely manner, or at all. Further, there is a risk that acquisitions will not be properly integrated into Griffon’s existing structure. Griffon closed the acquisitions of La Hacienda, Tuscan Path, ClosetMaid and Harper Brush in the months of July through November 2017, Kelkay in February 2018, and CornellCookson in June 2018. This integration risk may be exacerbated when numerous acquisitions are consummated in a short time period. In implementing an acquisition growth strategy, the following may be encountered: •Costs associated with incomplete or poorly implemented acquisitions;•Expenses, delays and difficulties of integrating acquired companies into Griffon’s existing organization;•Dilution of the interest of existing stockholders;•Diversion of management’s attention; or•Difficulty in obtaining financing on acceptable terms, or at all.An unsuccessful implementation of Griffon’s acquisition growth strategy, including the failure to properly integrate acquisitions, could have an adverse impact on Griffon’s results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The loss of certain key officers or employees could adversely affect Griffon’s business. The success of Griffon is materially dependent upon the continued services of certain key officers and employees. The loss of such key personnel could have a material adverse effect on Griffon’s operating results or financial condition. Griffon is exposed to a variety of risks relating to non-U.S. sales and operations, including non-U.S. economic and political conditions and fluctuations in exchange rates.Griffon and its companies conduct operations in Canada, Australasia, the United Kingdom, Mexico and China, and sell their products in many countries around the world. Sales of products through non-U.S. subsidiaries accounted for approximately 16% of consolidated revenue for the year ended September 30, 2019. These sales could be adversely affected by changes in political and economic conditions, trade protection measures, such as tariffs, the ability of the Company to enter into industrial cooperation agreements (offset agreements), differing intellectual property rights and laws and changes in regulatory requirements that restrict the sales of products or increase costs in such locations. Enforcement of existing laws in such jurisdictions can be uncertain, and the lack of a sophisticated body of laws can create various uncertainties, including with respect to customer and supplier contracts. Currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in the non-U.S. regions in which Griffon does business may also have an impact on future reported financial results.Griffon's international sales and operations are subject to applicable laws relating to trade, export controls and foreign corrupt practices, the violation of which could adversely affect operations. Griffon is subject to various anti-corruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. In addition, Griffon is subject to export controls, laws and regulations such as the Arms Export Control Act, the International Traffic in Arms Regulation and the Export Administration Regulations, as well as to economic sanctions, laws and embargoes imposed by various governments or organizations, including the U.S. and the European Union or member countries. Violations of anti-corruption, export controls, or sanctions laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties, including debarment, loss of export privileges and loss of authorizations needed to conduct Griffon's international business, and could harm the ability to enter into contracts with the U.S. Government. Such violations could also result in Griffon being subject to other liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on Griffon's business, results of operations and financial condition.22Griffon may not be able to protect its proprietary rights. Griffon relies on a combination of patent, copyright and trademark laws, common law, trade secrets, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions to protect proprietary rights. Such measures do not provide absolute protection and Griffon cannot give assurance that measures for protecting these proprietary rights are and will be adequate, or that competitors will not independently develop similar technologies. Griffon may inadvertently infringe on, or may be accused of infringing on, proprietary rights held by another party. Griffon is regularly improving its technology and employing existing technologies in new ways. Though Griffon takes reasonable precautions to ensure it does not infringe on the rights of others, it is possible that Griffon may inadvertently infringe on, or be accused of infringing on, proprietary rights held by others. If Griffon is found to have infringed on the propriety rights held by others, any related litigation or settlement relating to such infringement may have a material effect on Griffon’s business, results of operations and financial condition. Griffon is exposed to product liability and warranty claims. Griffon is subject to product liability and warranty claims in the ordinary course of business, including with respect to former businesses now included within discontinued operations. These claims relate to the conformity of its products with required specifications, and to alleged or actual defects in Griffon’s products (or in end-products in which Griffon’s products were a component part) that cause damage to property or persons. There can be no assurance that the frequency and severity of product liability claims brought against Griffon will not increase, which claims can be brought either by an injured customer of an end product manufacturer who used one of Griffon's products as a component or by a direct purchaser. There is also no assurance that the number and value of warranty claims will not increase as compared to historical claim rates, or that Griffon's warranty reserve at any particular time is sufficient. No assurance can be given that indemnification from customers or coverage under insurance policies will be adequate to cover future product liability claims against Griffon; for example, product liability insurance typically does not cover claims for punitive damages. Warranty claims are typically not covered by insurance at all. Product liability insurance can be expensive, difficult to maintain and may be unobtainable in the future on acceptable terms. The amount and scope of any insurance coverage may be inadequate if a product liability claim is successfully asserted. Furthermore, if any significant claims are made, the business and the related financial condition of Griffon may be adversely affected by negative publicity. Griffon has been, and may in the future be, subject to claims and liabilities under environmental laws and regulations.Griffon’s operations and assets are subject to environmental laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment, the handling and disposal of wastes, including solid and hazardous wastes, and otherwise relating to health, safety and protection of the environment, in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Griffon does not expect to make any expenditure with respect to ongoing compliance with or remediation under these environmental laws and regulations that would have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results or financial condition. However, the applicable requirements under environmental laws and regulations may change at any time. Griffon can incur environmental costs related to sites that are no longer owned or operated, as well as third-party sites to which hazardous materials are sent. Material expenditures or liabilities may be incurred in connection with such claims. See the Commitment and Contingencies footnote in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on environmental contingencies. Based on facts presently known, the outcome of current environmental matters are not expected to have a material adverse effect on Griffon’s results of operations and financial condition. However, presently unknown environmental conditions, changes in environmental laws and regulations or other unanticipated events may give rise to claims that may involve material expenditures or liabilities. Changes in income tax laws and regulations or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect profitability.Griffon is subject to Federal, state and local income taxes in the U.S. and in various taxing jurisdictions outside the U.S. Tax provisions and liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various U.S. and international tax jurisdictions. Griffon’s effective tax rate could be adversely affected by the 2017 “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” (“TCJA”) which includes a new U.S. tax on certain off-shore earnings, referred to as Global Intangible Low Tax Income, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in any valuation allowance for deferred tax assets or the amendment or enactment of tax laws. The amount of income taxes paid is subject to audits by U.S. Federal, state and local tax authorities, as well as tax authorities in the taxing jurisdictions outside the U.S. If such audits result in assessments different from recorded income tax liabilities, Griffon’s future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to its income tax provision.23There are risks associated with Griffon’s indebtedness. While Griffon’s senior notes, which have limited covenants, are not due until 2022, and while its $350 million revolving line of credit, which is largely undrawn, has greater covenant requirements, there are potential impacts from Griffon’s use of debt to finance certain of its activities, especially acquisitions and expansions, as set forth below. Compliance with restrictions and covenants in Griffon’s debt agreements may limit its ability to take corporate actions. The credit agreement entered into by, and, to a lesser extent, the terms of the senior notes issued by, Griffon each contain covenants that restrict the ability of Griffon and its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional debt, pay dividends, incur liens and make investments, acquisitions, dispositions, restricted payments and capital expenditures. Under the credit agreement, which is largely undrawn, Griffon is also required to comply with specific financial ratios and tests. Griffon may not be able to comply in the future with these covenants or restrictions as a result of events beyond its control, such as prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions or a change in control of Griffon. If Griffon defaults in maintaining compliance with the covenants and restrictions in its credit agreement or the senior notes, its lenders could declare all of the principal and interest amounts outstanding due and payable and, in the case of the credit agreement, terminate the commitments to extend credit to Griffon in the future. If Griffon or its subsidiaries are unable to secure credit in the future, its business could be harmed.Griffon may be unable to raise additional financing if needed. Griffon may need to raise additional financing in the future in order to implement its business plan, refinance debt, or to acquire new or complimentary businesses or assets. Any required additional financing may be unavailable, or only available at unfavorable terms, due to uncertainties in the credit markets. If Griffon raises additional funds by issuing equity securities, current holders of its common stock may experience significant ownership interest dilution and the holders of the new securities may have rights senior to the rights associated with current outstanding common stock. Griffon’s indebtedness and interest expense could limit cash flow and adversely affect operations and Griffon’s ability to make full payment on outstanding debt. Griffon’s indebtedness poses potential risks such as: •A substantial portion of cash flows from operations could be used to pay principal and interest on debt, thereby reducing the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, product development and other general corporate purposes;•Insufficient cash flows from operations may force Griffon to sell assets, or seek additional capital, which Griffon may not be able to accomplish on favorable terms, if at all; and•Its level of indebtedness may make Griffon more vulnerable to economic or industry downturns.Griffon has the ability to issue additional equity securities, which would lead to dilution of issued and outstanding common stock. The issuance of additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities would result in dilution to existing stockholders’ equity interests. Griffon is authorized to issue, without stockholder vote or approval, 3,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series, and has the ability to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of any such series. Any such series of preferred stock could contain dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices, liquidation preferences or other rights superior to the rights of holders of Griffon’s common stock.  While there is no present intention of issuing any such preferred stock, Griffon reserves the right to do so at any time. In addition, Griffon is authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, up to 85,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 46,806,076 shares, net of treasury shares, were outstanding as of September 30, 2019. Additionally, Griffon is authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, securities convertible into either shares of common stock or preferred stock"
12,GFF,GRIFFON CORP,2018-11-19,"Risk Factors
 Griffon’s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors which could cause Griffon’s actual results to vary materially from recent or anticipated future results. The risk factors discussed in this section should be carefully considered with all of the information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risk factors should not be considered the only risk factors facing Griffon. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that are currently deemed immaterial may also materially impact Griffon’s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows in the future. In general, Griffon is subject to the same general risks and uncertainties that impact other diverse manufacturing companies including, but not limited to, general economic, industry and/or market conditions and growth rates; impact of natural disasters and their effect on global markets; possible future terrorist threats and their effect on the worldwide economy; and changes in laws or accounting rules. Griffon has identified the following specific risks and uncertainties that it believes have the potential to materially affect its business and financial condition. Current worldwide economic uncertainty and market volatility could adversely affect Griffon’s businesses. The current worldwide economic uncertainty and market volatility could continue to have an adverse effect on Griffon during 2019, particularly in HBP, which is substantially linked to the U.S. housing and the commercial property markets, and the U.S. economy in general.   Purchases of many HBP products are discretionary for consumers who are generally more willing to purchase products during periods in which favorable macroeconomic conditions prevail. Additionally, the current condition of the credit markets could impact Griffon’s ability to refinance expiring debt or obtain additional credit on favorable terms for investments in 14current businesses or for acquisitions, or may render financing unavailable. Griffon is also exposed to certain fundamental economic risks including a decrease in the demand for the products and services it offers or a higher likelihood of default on its receivables. Adverse trends and general economic conditions, especially those that relate to construction and renovation, will impact Griffon’s business.HBP’s business serves residential and commercial construction and renovation, and is influenced by market conditions that affect these industries. For the year ended September 30, 2018, assuming CornellCookson was acquired on October 1, 2017, approximately 83% of Griffon’s consolidated revenue was derived from the HBP segment, which was dependent on renovation of existing homes, new home construction, and commercial non-residential construction, repair and replacement. Following the acquisition of CornellCookson, a greater portion of CBP’s business relates to commercial construction and renovation. The strength of the U.S. economy, the age of existing home stock, job growth, interest rates, consumer confidence and the availability of consumer credit, as well as demographic factors such as migration into the U.S. and migration of the population within the U.S., also have an effect on HBP.  With the addition of CornellCookson, a greater portion of CBP’s business is dependent on commercial construction and renovation of warehouses and retail facilities. To the extent market conditions for residential and commercial construction and renovation are weaker than expected, this will likely have an adverse impact on the performance and financial results of the HBP business.Griffon operates in highly competitive industries and may be unable to compete effectively. Griffon’s operating companies face intense competition in the markets they serve. Griffon competes primarily on the basis of technical expertise, product differentiation, quality of products and services, and price. There are a number of competitors to Griffon, some of which are larger and have greater resources than Griffon’s operating companies. Griffon's operating companies may face additional competition from companies that operate in countries with significantly lower operating costs.  Many of HBP’s customers are large mass merchandisers, such as discount stores, home centers, warehouse clubs, commercial distributors and e-commerce companies. The growing share of the market represented by these large mass merchandisers, together with changes in consumer shopping patterns, have contributed to the increase of  multi-category retailers and e-commerce companies that have strong negotiating power with suppliers. Many of these retailers import products directly from foreign suppliers to source and sell products under their own private label brands to compete with HBP’s products and brands, which puts increasing price pressure on HBP's products. In addition, the intense competition in the retail and e-commerce sectors, combined with the overall increasingly competitive economic environment, may result in a number of customers experiencing financial difficulty, or failing in the future. The loss of, or a failure by, one of HBP’s large customers could adversely impact HBP’s sales and operating cash flows. To address all of these challenges, HBP must be able to respond to these competitive pressures, and the failure to respond effectively could result in a loss of sales, reduced profitability and a limited ability to recover cost increases through price increases. In addition, there can be no assurance that Griffon will not encounter increased competition in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on Griffon’s financial results.The loss of large customers can harm financial results. A small number of customers account for, and are expected to continue to account for, a substantial portion of Griffon's consolidated revenue.  Home Depot, Lowe’s, Menards and Bunnings are significant customers of HBP with Home Depot accounting for approximately 19% of consolidated revenue and 23% of HBP's revenue for the year ended September 30, 2018. The U.S. Government and its agencies and subcontractors, including Lockheed Martin and Boeing, is a significant customer of Telephonics, and together accounts for approximately 10% of consolidated revenue and 62% of Telephonics segment revenue (Lockheed Martin and Boeing each individually represent less than 10% of consolidated revenue inclusive of such sales to the U.S. Government). Future operating results will continue to substantially depend on the success of Griffon’s largest customers, as well as Griffon’s relationships with them. Orders from these customers are subject to fluctuation and may be reduced materially due to changes in customer needs or other factors. Any reduction or delay in sales of products to one or more of these customers could significantly reduce Griffon’s revenue. Griffon’s operating results will also depend on successfully developing relationships with additional key customers. Griffon cannot assure that its largest customers will be retained or that additional key customers will be recruited. Also, HBP extends credit to its customers, which exposes it to credit risk. HBP’s largest customer accounted for approximately 24% and 20% of HBP’s and Griffon’s net accounts receivable as of September 30, 2018, respectively. If this customer were to become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay its debts, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of HBP and Griffon could be adversely affected.15Reliance on third party suppliers and manufacturers may impair HBP's ability to meet its customer demands. HBP relies on a limited number of domestic and foreign companies to supply components and manufacture certain of its products. The percentage of HBP's sourced finished goods as a percent of revenue approximated 20% in 2018. The percentage of HBP's sourced components as a percent of cost of goods sold approximated 13% in 2018. Reliance on third party suppliers and manufacturers may reduce control over the timing of deliveries and quality of HBP's products. Reduced product quality or failure to deliver products timely may jeopardize relationships with certain of HBP's key customers. In addition, reliance on third party suppliers or manufacturers may result in the failure to meet HBP's customer demands. Continued turbulence in the worldwide economy may affect the liquidity and financial condition of HBP's suppliers. Should any of these parties fail to manufacture sufficient supply, go out of business or discontinue a particular component, alternative suppliers may not be found in a timely manner, if at all. Such events could impact HBP's ability to fill orders, which could have a material adverse effect on customer relationships. If Griffon is unable to obtain raw materials for products at favorable prices it could adversely impact operating performance. HBP’s suppliers primarily provide resin, wood, steel and wire rod.  HBP could experience shortages of raw materials or components for products or be forced to seek alternative sources of supply. If temporary shortages due to disruptions in supply caused by weather, transportation, production delays or other factors require raw materials to be secured from sources other than current suppliers, the terms may not be as favorable as current terms or certain materials may not be available at all. In recent years, HBP has experienced price increases in steel and plastic resins. While most key raw materials used in Griffon’s businesses are generally available from numerous sources, raw materials are subject to price fluctuations. Because raw materials in the aggregate constitute a significant component of the cost of goods sold, price fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on Griffon’s results of operations. Griffon’s ability to pass raw material price increases to customers is limited due to supply arrangements and competitive pricing pressure, and there is generally a time lag between increased raw material costs and implementation of corresponding price increases for Griffon’s products. In particular, sharp increases in raw material prices are more difficult to pass through to customers and may negatively affect short-term financial performance. HBP is subject to risks from sourcing from international locations, especially China HBP’s business is global, with products and raw materials sourced from, manufactured in and sold in multiple countries around the world. There are risks associated with conducting a business that may be impacted by political and other developments associated with international trade. In this regard, certain products sold by HBP in the United States and elsewhere are sourced from China; and raw materials used by HBP may be sourced from China and therefore may have their prices impacted by tariffs imposed on trade between the United States and China. The sourcing of HBP's finished goods, components and raw materials from China are generally subject to supply agreements with Chinese companies. China does not have a well-developed, consolidated body of laws governing agreements with international customers. Enforcement of existing laws or contracts based on existing law may be uncertain and sporadic, and it may be difficult to obtain swift and equitable enforcement or to obtain enforcement of a judgment by a court of another jurisdiction. The relative inexperience of China’s judiciary on matters of international trade in many cases creates additional uncertainty as to the outcome of any litigation. In addition, interpretation of statutes and regulations in China may be subject to government policies reflecting domestic political changes. Because of the high volume of sourcing by HBP from China, if significant tariffs or other restrictions are placed on Chinese imports into the U.S. or any related counter-measures are taken by China, HBP’s revenue and results of operations may be materially harmed. The Trump Administration has signaled that it may alter trade agreements and terms between China and the U.S., including limiting trade with China and/or imposing a tariff on imports from China. In March 2018, a 25% tariff was imposed on steel imports and a 10% tariff was imposed on aluminum imports, and additional tariffs were announced on goods imported from China specifically, as well as certain other countries. The materials subject to these additional tariffs include various steel and aluminum finished goods, as well as a variety of resins, fabrics and wood products. As a result of these tariffs we intend to manage our China supply base and raise prices on certain goods, which may result in the loss of customers and reduced sales and could impact our operating performance. HBP’s operations are also subject to the effects of international trade agreements and regulations such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, and the activities and regulations of the World Trade Organization. Although these trade agreements generally have positive effects on trade liberalization, sourcing flexibility and cost of goods by reducing or eliminating the 16duties and/or quotas assessed on products manufactured in a particular country, trade agreements can also adversely affect HBP’s business. For example, trade agreements can result in setting quotas on products that may be imported from a particular country into key markets including the U.S., Canada, Australia and the United Kingdom, or may make it easier for other companies to compete by eliminating restrictions on products from countries where HBP’s competitors source products. HBP’s ability to import products in a timely and cost-effective manner may also be affected by conditions at ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers, such as port and shipping capacity, labor disputes, severe weather or increased homeland security requirements in the U.S. and other countries. These issues could delay importation of products or require HBP to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to customers. These alternatives may not be available on short notice or could result in higher transit costs, which could have an adverse impact on HBP’s business and financial condition.Griffon’s businesses are subject to seasonal variations and the impact of uncertain weather patterns. Historically, overall Griffon revenue and earnings are lower in the first and second quarters ending December 31 and March 31, respectively and higher in the third and fourth quarters ending June 30 and September 30, respectively.  HBP revenue and earnings are generally lowest in our first and fourth quarters ending December 31, and September 30, respectively, and highest in the second and third quarters ending March 31, and June 30, respectively, primarily due to the seasonality of the AMES business.  In 2018, 55% of AMES' sales occurred during the second and third quarters.  CBP’s business is driven by residential renovation and construction, which occurs more during warm weather, than during the winter months, and so revenues and earnings of CBP are generally lower in the second quarter.  Telephonics historically has had higher revenue and earnings in the second half of Griffon's fiscal year ending September 30 (although this has not always been the case).Demand for lawn and garden products is influenced by weather, particularly weekend weather during the peak gardening season. AMES' sales volumes could be adversely affected by certain weather patterns such as unseasonably cool or warm temperatures, hurricanes, water shortages or floods. In addition, lack of snow or lower than average snowfall during the winter season may result in reduced sales of certain AMES' products such as snow shovels and other snow tools. As a result, AMES' results of operations, financial results and cash flows could be adversely impacted. Each of Griffon's businesses faces risks related to the disruption of its primary manufacturing facilities.The manufacturing facilities for each of Griffon's businesses are concentrated in just a few locations, and in the case of AMES, some of these locations are abroad in low-cost locations. Any of Griffon's manufacturing facilities are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, such as natural or man-made disasters, terrorist activities, disruptions of information technology resources, and utility interruptions. Such disruptions may cause delays in shipping products, which could result in the loss of business or customer trust, adversely affecting Griffon’s businesses and operating results. Manufacturing capacity constraints or increased manufacturing costs may have a material adverse effect on Griffon's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Griffon’s current manufacturing resources may be inadequate to meet significantly increased demand for some of its products. Griffon’s ability to increase its manufacturing capacity depends on many factors, including the availability of capital, steadily increasing consumer demand, equipment delivery, construction lead-times, installation, qualification, and permitting and other regulatory requirements. Increasing capacity through the use of third-party manufacturers may depend on Griffon’s ability to develop and maintain such relationships and the ability of such third parties to devote additional capacity to fill its orders.A lack of sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand could cause customer service levels to decrease, which may negatively affect customer demand for Griffon's products and customer relations generally, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on Griffon's business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, operating facilities at or near capacity may also increase production and distribution costs and negatively impact relations with employees or contractors, which could result in disruptions to operations.In addition, manufacturing costs may increase significantly and Griffon may not be able to successfully recover these cost increases with increased pricing to its customers.If AMES does not continue to develop and maintain leading brands or realize the anticipated benefits of advertising and promotion spend, its operating results may suffer.17The ability of AMES to compete successfully depends in part on the company’s ability to develop and maintain leading brands so that retail and other customers will need its products to meet consumer demand. Leading brands allow AMES to realize economies of scale in its operations. The development and maintenance of such brands require significant investment in brand-building and marketing initiatives. While AMES plans to continue to increase its expenditures for advertising and promotion and other brand-building and marketing initiatives over the long term, the initiatives may not deliver the anticipated results and the results of such initiatives may not cover the costs of the increased investment.Unionized employees could strike or participate in a work stoppage. At September 30, 2018, Griffon employed approximately 7,200 people on a full-time basis, approximately 6% of whom are covered by collective bargaining or similar labor agreements (all within Telephonics and AMES). If unionized employees engage in a strike or other work stoppage, or if Griffon is unable to negotiate acceptable extensions of agreements with labor unions, a significant disruption of operations and increased operating costs could occur. In addition, any renegotiation or renewal of labor agreements could result in higher wages or benefits paid to unionized employees, which could increase operating costs and as a result have a material adverse effect on profitability.  Griffon may be required to record impairment charges for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.Griffon is required to assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually for impairment or on an interim basis if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest impairment exists. If impairment testing indicates that the carrying value of reporting units or indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds the respective fair value, an impairment charge would be recognized. If goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets were to become impaired, the results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.  Telephonics’ business depends heavily upon government contracts and, therefore, the defense budget. Telephonics sells products to the U.S. government and its agencies both directly and indirectly as a first-tier supplier to prime contractors in the defense industry such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Northrop Grumman. In the year ended September 30, 2018, U.S. government contracts and subcontracts accounted for approximately 10% of Griffon’s consolidated revenue. Contracts involving the U.S. government may include various risks, including: •Termination for default or for convenience by the government;•Reduction or modification in the event of changes in the government’s requirements or budgetary constraints;•Increased or unexpected costs, causing losses or reduced profits under contracts where Telephonics’ prices are fixed, or determinations that certain costs are not allowable under particular government contracts;•The failure or inability of the prime contractor to perform its contract under circumstances in which Telephonics is a subcontractor;•Failure to observe and comply with government business practice and procurement regulations such that Telephonics could be suspended or barred from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts;•The failure of the government to exercise options for additional work provided for in contracts;•The inherent discretion of government agencies in determining whether Telephonics has complied with all specifications set forth in a government contract; and•The government’s right, in certain circumstances, to freely use technology developed under these contracts.All of Telephonics’ U.S. Government end-user contracts contain a termination for convenience clause, regardless if Telephonics is the prime contractor or the subcontractor. This clause generally entitles Telephonics, upon a termination for convenience, to receive the purchase price for delivered items, reimbursement of allowable work-in-process costs, and an allowance for profit. Allowable costs would include the costs to terminate existing agreements with suppliers. The programs in which Telephonics participates may extend for several years, and may be funded on an incremental basis. Decreases in the U.S. defense budget, in particular with respect to programs to which Telephonics supplies materials, could have a material adverse impact on Telephonics' financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows. The U.S. government may not continue to fund programs to which Telephonics’ development projects apply. Even if funding is continued, Telephonics may fail to compete successfully to obtain funding pursuant to such programs. Reductions to funding on existing programs or delays in the funding of new opportunities could affect the timing of revenue recognition, and impact Telephonics' and Griffon's results of operations.Ability of government to fund and conduct its operations18 The impact of a government shutdown for any duration could have a material adverse effect on Telephonics’ revenues, profits and cash flows. Telephonics relies on government personnel to conduct routine business processes related to the inspection and delivery of products for various programs, to approve and pay certain billings and invoices, to process export licenses and for other administrative services that, if disrupted, could have an immediate impact on Telephonics’ business. Telephonics’ business could be adversely affected by a negative audit by the U.S. Government As a government contractor, and a subcontractor to government contractors, Telephonics is subject to audits and investigations by U.S. Government Agencies such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Defense Security Service, with respect to its classified contracts, other Inspectors General and the Department of Justice. These agencies review a contractor’s performance under its contracts, its cost structure and compliance with applicable laws and standards as well as compliance with applicable regulations, including those relating to facility and personnel security clearances. These agencies also review the adequacy of, and a contractor’s compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the contractor’s management, purchasing, property, estimating, compensation, and accounting and information systems. Any costs found to be misclassified or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed, or must be refunded if already billed and collected. Griffon could incur significant expenses in complying with audits and subpoenas issued by the government in aid of inquiries and investigations. If an audit or an investigation uncovers a failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, or improper or illegal activities, Telephonics may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and/or administrative sanctions, which could include contract termination, forfeiture of profit, suspension of payments, fines, including treble damages, and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. Government. In addition, if allegations of impropriety are made, Telephonics and Griffon could suffer serious harm to their reputation. Many of Griffon's contracts contain performance obligations that require innovative design capabilities, are technologically complex, or are dependent upon factors not wholly within Griffon's control. Failure to meet these obligations could adversely affect customer relations, future business opportunities, and overall profitability. Telephonics designs, develops and manufactures advanced and innovative surveillance and communication products for a broad range of applications for use in varying environments. As with many of Telephonics' programs, system specifications, operational requirements and test requirements are challenging, exacerbated by the need for quick delivery schedules. Technical problems encountered and delays in the development or delivery of such products, as well as the inherent discretion involved in government approval related to compliance with applicable specifications of products supplied under government contracts, could prevent Griffon from meeting contractual obligations, which could subject Griffon to termination for default. Under a termination for default, the company is entitled to negotiate payment for undelivered work if the Government requests the transfer of title and delivery of partially completed supplies and materials. Conversely, if the Government does not make this request, there is no obligation to reimburse the company for its costs incurred. Griffon may also be subject to the repayment of advance and progress payments, if any. Additionally, the company may be liable to the Government for any of its excess costs incurred in acquiring supplies and services similar to those terminated for default, and for other damages. Should any of the foregoing events occur, it could result in a material adverse effect on Griffon's financial position.Griffon's business could be negatively affected by cyber or other security threats or other disruptions.Overall, Griffon and its operating companies are subjected to cyber and other security threats common to U.S. businesses. As a U.S. defense contractor, Telephonics, in particular, may be the target of cyber security threats to its information technology infrastructure and unauthorized attempts to gain access to sensitive or highly confidential information that could compromise U.S. security.  The types of threats could vary from attacks common to most industries to more advanced and persistent, highly organized adversaries who target Telephonics because of national security information in its possession.  If Telephonics is unable to protect sensitive information, its customers or governmental authorities could question the adequacy of its security processes and procedures and its compliance with evolving government cyber security requirements for government contractors. Due to the evolving nature of these security threats, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted.The costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions could be significant.  Security events such as these could adversely affect Griffon's internal operations, future financial results and reputation, as well as result in the loss of competitive advantages derived from research and development efforts and other intellectual property.If Griffon's subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform their obligations, Griffon's performance and ability to win future business could be harmed.19Griffon relies on other companies to provide materials, major components and products to fulfill contractual obligations. Such arrangements may involve subcontracts, teaming arrangements, or supply agreements with other companies. There is a risk that Griffon may have disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed. In addition, changes in the economic environment, including defense budgets and constraints on available financing, may adversely affect the financial stability of Griffon's supply chain and their ability to meet their performance requirements or to provide needed supplies on a timely basis. A disruption or failure of any supplier could have an adverse effect on Griffon's business resulting in an impact to profitability, possible termination of a contract, imposition of fines or penalties, and harm to Griffon's reputation impacting its ability to secure future business.Griffon’s companies must continually improve existing products, design and sell new products and invest in research and development in order to compete effectively. The markets for Griffon’s products are characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and continuous improvements in products. Due to constant changes in Griffon's markets, future success depends on Griffon's ability to develop new technologies, products, processes and product applications.  Griffon's long-term success in the competitive retail environment and the industrial and commercial markets depends on its ability to develop and commercialize a continuing stream of innovative new products that are appealing to ultimate end users and create demand. New product development and commercialization efforts, including efforts to enter markets or product categories in which Griffon has limited or no prior experience, have inherent risks. These risks include the costs involved, such as development and commercialization, product development or launch delays, and the failure of new products and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance or growth in sales or operating income.Griffon also faces the risk that its competitors will introduce innovative new products that compete with Griffon’s products.  In addition, sales generated by new products could cause a decline in sales of Griffon’s other existing products. If new product development and commercialization efforts are not successful, Griffon’s financial results could be adversely affected.Product and technological developments are accomplished both through internally-funded R&D projects, as well as through strategic partnerships with customers. Because it is not generally possible to predict the amount of time required and costs involved in achieving certain R&D objectives, actual development costs may exceed budgeted amounts and estimated product development schedules may be extended. Griffon’s financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if: •Product improvements are not completed on a timely basis;•New products are not introduced on a timely basis or do not achieve sufficient market penetration;•There are budget overruns or delays in R&D efforts; or•New products experience reliability or quality problems, or otherwise do not meet customer preferences or requirements.Griffon may be unable to implement its acquisition growth strategy, which may result in added expenses without a commensurate increase in revenue and income and divert management’s attention. Making strategic acquisitions is a significant part of Griffon’s growth plans. The ability to successfully complete acquisitions depends on identifying and acquiring, on acceptable terms, companies that either complement or enhance currently held businesses or expand Griffon into new profitable businesses, and, for certain acquisitions, obtaining financing on acceptable terms. Additionally, Griffon must properly integrate acquired businesses in order to maximize profitability. The competition for acquisition candidates is intense and Griffon cannot assure that it will successfully identify acquisition candidates and complete acquisitions at reasonable purchase prices, in a timely manner, or at all. Further, there is a risk that acquisitions will not be properly integrated into Griffon’s existing structure. Griffon closed the acquisitions of La Hacienda, Tuscan Path, ClosetMaid and Harper Brush in the months of July through November 2017, Kelkay in February 2018, and CornellCookson in June 2018. This integration risk may be exacerbated when numerous acquisitions are consummated in a short time period. In implementing an acquisition growth strategy, the following may be encountered: •Costs associated with incomplete or poorly implemented acquisitions;•Expenses, delays and difficulties of integrating acquired companies into Griffon’s existing organization;•Dilution of the interest of existing stockholders;•Diversion of management’s attention; or•Difficulty in obtaining financing on acceptable terms, or at all.20An unsuccessful implementation of Griffon’s acquisition growth strategy, including the failure to properly integrate acquisitions, could have an adverse impact on Griffon’s results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The loss of certain key officers or employees could adversely affect Griffon’s business. The success of Griffon is materially dependent upon the continued services of certain key officers and employees. The loss of such key personnel could have a material adverse effect on Griffon’s operating results or financial condition. Griffon is exposed to a variety of risks relating to non-U.S. sales and operations, including non-U.S. economic and political conditions and fluctuations in exchange rates.Griffon and its companies conduct operations in Canada, Australasia, the United Kingdom, Mexico and China, and sell their products in many countries around the world. Sales of products through non-U.S. subsidiaries accounted for approximately 17% of consolidated revenue for the year ended September 30, 2018. These sales could be adversely affected by changes in political and economic conditions, trade protection measures, such as tariffs, the ability of the Company to enter into industrial cooperation agreements (offset agreements), differing intellectual property rights and laws and changes in regulatory requirements that restrict the sales of products or increase costs in such locations. Enforcement of existing laws in such jurisdictions can be uncertain, and the lack of a sophisticated body of laws can create various uncertainties, including with respect to customer and supplier contracts. Currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in the non-U.S. regions in which Griffon does business may also have an impact on future reported financial results.Griffon's international sales and operations are subject to applicable laws relating to trade, export controls and foreign corrupt practices, the violation of which could adversely affect operations. Griffon is subject to various anti-corruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. In addition, Griffon is subject to export controls, laws and regulations such as the Arms Export Control Act, the International Traffic in Arms Regulation and the Export Administration Regulations, as well as to economic sanctions, laws and embargoes imposed by various governments or organizations, including the U.S. and the European Union or member countries. Violations of anti-corruption, export controls, or sanctions laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties, including debarment, loss of export privileges and loss of authorizations needed to conduct Griffon's international business, and could harm the ability to enter into contracts with the U.S. Government. Such violations could also result in Griffon being subject to other liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on Griffon's business, results of operations and financial condition.Griffon may not be able to protect its proprietary rights. Griffon relies on a combination of patent, copyright and trademark laws, common law, trade secrets, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions to protect proprietary rights. Such measures do not provide absolute protection and Griffon cannot give assurance that measures for protecting these proprietary rights are and will be adequate, or that competitors will not independently develop similar technologies. Griffon may inadvertently infringe on, or may be accused of infringing on, proprietary rights held by another party. Griffon is regularly improving its technology and employing existing technologies in new ways. Though Griffon takes reasonable precautions to ensure it does not infringe on the rights of others, it is possible that Griffon may inadvertently infringe on, or be accused of infringing on, proprietary rights held by others. If Griffon is found to have infringed on the propriety rights held by others, any related litigation or settlement relating to such infringement may have a material effect on Griffon’s business, results of operations and financial condition. Griffon is exposed to product liability and warranty claims. Griffon is subject to product liability and warranty claims in the ordinary course of business, including with respect to former businesses now included within discontinued operations. These claims relate to the conformity of its products with required specifications, and to alleged or actual defects in Griffon’s products (or in end-products in which Griffon’s products were a component part) that cause damage to property or persons. There can be no assurance that the frequency and severity of product liability claims brought against Griffon will not increase, which claims can be brought either by an injured customer of an end product manufacturer who used one of Griffon's products as a component or by a direct purchaser. There is also no assurance that the number and value of warranty claims will not increase as compared to historical claim rates, or that Griffon's warranty reserve at any particular time is sufficient. No assurance can be given that indemnification from customers or coverage under insurance policies will be adequate to cover future product liability claims against Griffon; for example, product liability insurance typically does not cover claims for punitive damages. Warranty claims are typically not covered by insurance at all. Product liability insurance 21can be expensive, difficult to maintain and may be unobtainable in the future on acceptable terms. The amount and scope of any insurance coverage may be inadequate if a product liability claim is successfully asserted. Furthermore, if any significant claims are made, the business and the related financial condition of Griffon may be adversely affected by negative publicity. Griffon has been, and may in the future be, subject to claims and liabilities under environmental laws and regulations.Griffon’s operations and assets are subject to environmental laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment, the handling and disposal of wastes, including solid and hazardous wastes, and otherwise relating to health, safety and protection of the environment, in the various jurisdictions in which it operates. Griffon does not expect to make any expenditure with respect to ongoing compliance with or remediation under these environmental laws and regulations that would have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results or financial condition. However, the applicable requirements under environmental laws and regulations may change at any time. Griffon can incur environmental costs related to sites that are no longer owned or operated, as well as third-party sites to which hazardous materials are sent. Material expenditures or liabilities may be incurred in connection with such claims. See the Commitment and Contingencies footnote in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on environmental contingencies. Based on facts presently known, the outcome of current environmental matters are not expected to have a material adverse effect on Griffon’s results of operations and financial condition. However, presently unknown environmental conditions, changes in environmental laws and regulations or other unanticipated events may give rise to claims that may involve material expenditures or liabilities. Changes in income tax laws and regulations or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect profitability.Griffon is subject to Federal, state and local income taxes in the U.S. and in various taxing jurisdictions outside the U.S. Tax provisions and liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various U.S. and international tax jurisdictions. Griffon’s effective tax rate could be adversely affected by the 2017 “Tax Cuts and Jobs Act” (“TCJA”) which includes a new U.S. tax on certain off-shore earnings, referred to as Global Intangible Low Tax Income, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in any valuation allowance for deferred tax assets or the amendment or enactment of tax laws. The amount of income taxes paid is subject to audits by U.S. Federal, state and local tax authorities, as well as tax authorities in the taxing jurisdictions outside the U.S. If such audits result in assessments different from recorded income tax liabilities, Griffon’s future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to its income tax provision.There are risks associated with Griffon’s indebtedness. While Griffon’s senior notes, which have limited covenants, are not due until 2022, and while its $350 million revolving line of credit, which is largely undrawn, has greater covenant requirements, there are potential impacts from Griffon’s use of debt to finance certain of its activities, especially acquisitions and expansions, as set forth below. Compliance with restrictions and covenants in Griffon’s debt agreements may limit its ability to take corporate actions. The credit agreement entered into by, and, to a lesser extent, the terms of the senior notes issued by, Griffon each contain covenants that restrict the ability of Griffon and its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional debt, pay dividends, incur liens and make investments, acquisitions, dispositions, restricted payments and capital expenditures. Under the credit agreement, which is largely undrawn, Griffon is also required to comply with specific financial ratios and tests. Griffon may not be able to comply in the future with these covenants or restrictions as a result of events beyond its control, such as prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions or a change in control of Griffon. If Griffon defaults in maintaining compliance with the covenants and restrictions in its credit agreement or the senior notes, its lenders could declare all of the principal and interest amounts outstanding due and payable and, in the case of the credit agreement, terminate the commitments to extend credit to Griffon in the future. If Griffon or its subsidiaries are unable to secure credit in the future, its business could be harmed.Griffon may be unable to raise additional financing if needed. Griffon may need to raise additional financing in the future in order to implement its business plan, refinance debt, or to acquire new or complimentary businesses or assets. Any required additional financing may be unavailable, or only available at unfavorable terms, due to uncertainties in the credit markets. If Griffon raises additional funds by issuing equity securities, current holders of its common stock may experience significant ownership interest dilution and the holders of the new securities may have rights senior to the rights associated with current outstanding common stock.22 Griffon’s indebtedness and interest expense could limit cash flow and adversely affect operations and Griffon’s ability to make full payment on outstanding debt. Griffon’s indebtedness poses potential risks such as: •A substantial portion of cash flows from operations could be used to pay principal and interest on debt, thereby reducing the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, product development and other general corporate purposes;•Insufficient cash flows from operations may force Griffon to sell assets, or seek additional capital, which Griffon may not be able to accomplish on favorable terms, if at all; and•Its level of indebtedness may make Griffon more vulnerable to economic or industry downturns.Griffon has the ability to issue additional equity securities, which would lead to dilution of issued and outstanding common stock. The issuance of additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities would result in dilution to existing stockholders’ equity interests. Griffon is authorized to issue, without stockholder vote or approval, 3,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series, and has the ability to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of any such series. Any such series of preferred stock could contain dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices, liquidation preferences or other rights superior to the rights of holders of Griffon’s common stock.  While there is no present intention of issuing any such preferred stock, Griffon reserves the right to do so at any time. In addition, Griffon is authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, up to 85,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 45,674,821 shares, net of treasury shares, were outstanding as of September 30, 2018. Additionally, Griffon is authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, securities convertible into either shares of common stock or preferred stock"
4,GFF,GRIFFON CORP,2017-11-20,"Risk Factors
 Griffon’s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors which could cause Griffon’s actual results to vary materially from recent or anticipated future results. The risk factors discussed in this section should be carefully considered with all of the information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risk factors should not be considered the only risk factors facing Griffon. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that are currently deemed immaterial may also materially impact Griffon’s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows in the future. In general, Griffon is subject to the same general risks and uncertainties that impact other diverse manufacturing companies including, but not limited to, general economic, industry and/or market conditions and growth rates; impact of natural disasters 16and their effect on global markets; continued events in the Middle East and Asia and possible future terrorist threats and their effect on the worldwide economy; and changes in laws or accounting rules. Griffon has identified the following specific risks and uncertainties that it believes have the potential to materially affect its business and financial condition. Current worldwide economic uncertainty and market volatility could adversely affect Griffon’s businesses. The current worldwide economic uncertainty and market volatility could continue to have an adverse effect on Griffon during 2018, particularly in HBP, which is substantially linked to the U.S. housing market and the U.S. economy in general.   Purchases of AMES' products are discretionary for consumers who are generally more willing to purchase products during periods in which favorable macroeconomic conditions prevail. Additionally, the current condition of the credit markets could impact Griffon’s ability to refinance expiring debt, obtain additional credit for investments in current businesses or for acquisitions, with favorable terms, or may render financing unavailable. Griffon is also exposed to basic economic risks including a decrease in the demand for the products and services it offers or a higher likelihood of default on its receivables. Adverse trends in the housing sector and in general economic conditions will directly impact Griffon’s business. HBP’s business is influenced by market conditions for new home construction and renovation of existing homes. For the year ended September 30, 2017, approximately 73% of Griffon’s consolidated revenue was derived from the HBP segment, which is heavily dependent on new home construction and renovation of existing homes. The strength of the U.S. economy, the age of existing home stock, job growth, interest rates, consumer confidence and the availability of consumer credit, as well as demographic factors such as migration into the U.S. and migration of the population within the U.S., also have an effect on HBP.  To the extent market conditions for new home construction and renovation of existing home are weaker than expected, this will likely have an adverse impact on the performance and financial results of the HBP business. Griffon operates in highly competitive industries and may be unable to compete effectively. Griffon’s operating companies face intense competition in each of the markets served. Griffon competes primarily on the basis of technical expertise, product differentiation quality of products and services, and competitive prices. There are a number of competitors to Griffon, some of which are larger and have greater resources than Griffon’s operating companies. As the economy continues to become more global, Griffon's operating companies may face additional competition from companies that operate in countries with significantly lower operating costs.  Many of HBP’s customers are large mass merchandisers, such as discount stores, home centers, warehouse clubs, office superstores, commercial distributors and e-commerce companies. The growing share of the market represented by these large mass merchandisers, together with changes in consumer shopping patterns, has contributed to the increase of  multi-category retailers and e-commerce companies that have strong negotiating power with suppliers. Many of these retailers import products directly from foreign sources to source and sell products under their own private label brands to compete with HBP’s products, which puts increasing price pressure on our products. In addition, the intense competition in the retail and e-commerce sectors, combined with the overall increasingly competitive economic environment, may result in a number of customers experiencing financial difficulty, or failing in the future. The loss of, or a failure by, one of HBP’s large customers could adversely impact HBP’s sales and operating cash flows. To address all of these challenges, HBP must be able to respond to these competitive pressures, and the failure to respond effectively could result in a loss of sales, reduced profitability and a limited ability to recover cost increases through price increases. In addition, there can be no assurance that Griffon will not encounter increased competition in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on Griffon’s financial results.The loss of large customers can harm financial results. A small number of customers account for, and are expected to continue to account for, a substantial portion of Griffon's consolidated revenue.  Home Depot, Lowe’s, Menards and Bunnings are significant customers of HBP with Home Depot accounting for approximately 17% of consolidated revenue and 23% of HBP's revenue for the year ended September 30, 2017. The U.S. Government and its agencies and subcontractors, including Lockheed Martin and Boeing, is a significant customer of Telephonics, and together accounts for approximately 18% of consolidated revenue and 66% of Telephonics segment revenue (Lockheed Martin and Boeing each represent less than 10% of consolidated revenue inclusive of such sales to the U.S. Government). Future operating results will continue to substantially depend on the success of Griffon’s largest customers, as well as Griffon’s relationship with them. Orders from these customers are subject to fluctuation and may be reduced materially due to changes in customer needs or other factors. Any reduction or delay in sales of products to one or more of these customers could significantly reduce Griffon’s 17revenue. Griffon’s operating results will also depend on successfully developing relationships with additional key customers. Griffon cannot assure that its largest customers will be retained or that additional key customers will be recruited. Also, HBP extends credit to its customers, which exposes it to credit risk. HBP’s largest customer accounted for approximately 26% and 19% of HBP’s and Griffon’s net accounts receivable as of September 30, 2017, respectively. If this customer were to become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay its debts, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of HBP and Griffon could be adversely affected.Reliance on third party suppliers and manufacturers may impair AMES' ability to meet its customer demands. AMES relies on a limited number of domestic and foreign companies to supply components and manufacture certain of its products. The percentage of AMES products sourced, based on revenue, approximated 40% in 2017. Reliance on third party suppliers and manufacturers may reduce control over the timing of deliveries and quality of AMES' products. Reduced product quality or failure to deliver products timely may jeopardize relationships with certain of AMES' key customers. In addition, reliance on third party suppliers or manufacturers may result in the failure to meet AMES' customer demands. Continued turbulence in the worldwide economy may affect the liquidity and financial condition of AMES' suppliers. Should any of these parties fail to manufacture sufficient supply, go out of business or discontinue a particular component, alternative suppliers may not be found in a timely manner, if at all. Such events could impact AMES' ability to fill orders, which could have a material adverse effect on customer relationships. If Griffon is unable to obtain raw materials for products at favorable prices it could adversely impact operating performance. HBP’s suppliers primarily provide resin, wood, steel and wire rod.  These segments could experience shortages of raw materials or components for products or be forced to seek alternative sources of supply. If temporary shortages due to disruptions in supply caused by weather, transportation, production delays or other factors require raw materials to be secured from sources other than current suppliers, the terms may not be as favorable as current terms or certain materials may not be available at all. In recent years, HBP has experienced price increases in steel and plastic resins. While most key raw materials used in Griffon’s businesses are generally available from numerous sources, raw materials are subject to price fluctuations. Because raw materials in the aggregate constitute a significant component of the cost of goods sold, price fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on Griffon’s results of operations. Griffon’s ability to pass raw material price increases to customers is limited due to supply arrangements and competitive pricing pressure, and there is generally a time lag between increased raw material costs and implementation of corresponding price increases for Griffon’s products. In particular, sharp increases in raw material prices are more difficult to pass through to customers and may negatively affect short-term financial performance.AMES and ClosetMaid are subject to risks associated with sourcing from Asia. A substantial amount of AMES finished goods sourcing is done through supply agreements with China based vendors, and ClosetMaid sources a substantial amount of raw material from China.  China does not have a well-developed, consolidated body of laws governing agreements with international customers. Enforcement of existing laws or contracts based on existing law may be uncertain and sporadic, and it may be difficult to obtain swift and equitable enforcement or to obtain enforcement of a judgment by a court of another jurisdiction. The relative inexperience of China’s judiciary on matters of international trade in many cases creates additional uncertainty as to the outcome of any litigation. In addition, interpretation of statutes and regulations may be subject to government policies reflecting domestic political changes. Products entering from China may be subject to import quotas, import duties and other restrictions. Any inability to import these products into the U.S. and any tariffs that may be levied with respect to these products may have a material adverse result on AMES' or ClosetMaid's business and results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Griffon’s businesses are subject to seasonal variations and the impact of uncertain weather patterns. Historically, Griffon’s revenue and income are lowest in our first and fourth quarters ending December 31, and September 30, respectively, and highest in our second and third quarters ending March 31, and June 30, respectively, primarily due to the seasonality of AMES' business.  With the 2014 acquisition of Northcote and Cyclone, and the 2017 acquisitions of Hills, La Hacienda and  Tuscan Path, AMES' revenue is less susceptible to seasonality.  In 2017, 55% of AMES' sales occurred during the second and third quarters compared to 56% in both 2016 and 2015.    CBP’s business is driven by residential renovation and construction during warm weather, which is generally at reduced levels during the winter months, generally in our second quarter.  18tMaid’s revenue and income are historically the lowest in the second quarter ended March 31 and highest in the first quarter ended December 30, primarily due to the holiday season.  Griffon's revenue is still expected to be lowest in the first and fourth quarters, subject to variations in weather and the related impact on AMES.Demand for lawn and garden products is influenced by weather, particularly weekend weather during the peak gardening season. AMES sales volumes could be adversely affected by certain weather patterns such as unseasonably cool or warm temperatures, hurricanes, water shortages or floods. In addition, lack of snow or lower than average snowfall during the winter season may result in reduced sales of certain AMES products, such as snow shovels and other snow tools. As a result, AMES' results of operations, financial results and cash flows could be adversely impacted. Each of our Griffon's businesses faces risks related to the disruption of its primary manufacturing facilities.The manufacturing facilities for each of our Griffon's businesses are concentrated in just a few locations, and in the case of ClosetMaid, some of these are located abroad in low-cost locations. Any of our manufacturing facilities are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, such as natural or man-made disasters, terrorist activities, disruptions of our information technology resources, and utility interruptions. Such disruptions may cause delays in shipping products, which could result in the loss of business or customer trust, adversely affecting Griffon’s businesses and operating results. Manufacturing capacity constraints or increased manufacturing costs may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.Griffon’s current manufacturing resources may be inadequate to meet significantly increased demand for some of its products. Griffon’s ability to increase its manufacturing capacity depends on many factors, including the availability of capital, steadily increasing consumer demand, equipment delivery, construction lead-times, installation, qualification, regulatory permitting and regulatory requirements. Increasing capacity through the use of third party manufacturers may depend on Griffon’s ability to develop and maintain such relationships and the ability of such third parties to devote additional capacity to fill its orders.A lack of sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand could cause our customer service levels to decrease, which may negatively affect customer demand for our products and customer relations generally, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, operating facilities at or near capacity may also increase production and distribution costs and negatively affect relations with our employees or contractors, which could result in disruptions in our operations.In addition, our manufacturing costs may increase significantly and we may not be able to successfully recover these cost increases with increased pricing to its customers.If Ames and ClosetMaid do not continue to develop and maintain leading brands or realize the anticipated benefits of increased advertising and promotion spend, their operating results may suffer.The ability of each of Ames and ClosetMaid to compete successfully depends in part on each such company’s ability to develop and maintain leading brands so that such company’s retail and other customers will need its products to meet consumer demand. Leading brands allow each of Ames and ClosetMaid to realize economies of scale in its operations. The development and maintenance of such brands require significant investment in brand-building and marketing initiatives. While each of Ames and ClosetMaid plans to continue to increase its expenditures for advertising and promotion and other brand-building and marketing initiatives over the long term, the initiatives may not deliver the anticipated results and the results of such initiatives may not cover the costs of the increased investment.Unionized employees could strike or participate in a work stoppage. At September 30, 2017, Griffon employed approximately 4,700 people on a full-time basis, approximately 9% of whom are covered by collective bargaining or similar labor agreements (all within Telephonics and AMES). If unionized employees engage in a strike or other work stoppage, or if Griffon is unable to negotiate acceptable extensions of agreements with labor unions, a significant disruption of operations and increased operating costs could occur. In addition, any renegotiation or renewal of labor agreements could result in higher wages or benefits paid to unionized employees, which could increase operating costs and could have a material adverse effect on profitability.  With the inclusion of the ClosetMaid acquisition on October 2, 2017, Griffon and its subsidiaries employ approximately 6,200 people. 19Griffon may be required to record impairment charges for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.Griffon is required to assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually for impairment or on an interim basis if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest impairment exists. If impairment testing indicates that the carrying value of reporting units or indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds the respective fair value, an impairment charge would be recognized. If goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets were to become impaired, the results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.  Telephonics’ business depends heavily upon government contracts and, therefore, the defense budget. Telephonics sells products to the U.S. government and its agencies both directly and indirectly as a first-tier supplier to prime contractors in the defense industry such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Northrop Grumman. In the year ended September 30, 2017, U.S. government contracts and subcontracts accounted for approximately 18% of Griffon’s consolidated revenue. Contracts involving the U.S. government may include various risks, including: •Termination for default or for convenience by the government;•Reduction or modification in the event of changes in the government’s requirements or budgetary constraints;•Increased or unexpected costs, causing losses or reduced profits under contracts where Telephonics’ prices are fixed, or determinations that certain costs are not allowable under particular government contracts;•The failure or inability of the prime contractor to perform its contract in circumstances where Telephonics is a subcontractor;•Failure to observe and comply with government business practice and procurement regulations such that Telephonics could be suspended or barred from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts;•The failure of the government to exercise options for additional work provided for in contracts;•The inherent discretion of government agencies in determining whether Telephonics has complied with all specifications set forth in a government contract; and•The government’s right, in certain circumstances, to freely use technology developed under these contracts.All of Telephonics’ U.S. Government end-user contracts contain a termination for convenience clause, regardless if Telephonics is the prime contractor or the subcontractor. This clause generally entitles Telephonics, upon a termination for convenience, to receive the purchase price for delivered items, reimbursement of allowable work-in-process costs, and an allowance for profit. Allowable costs would include the costs to terminate existing agreements with suppliers. The programs in which Telephonics participates may extend for several years, and may be funded on an incremental basis. Decreases in the U.S. defense budget, in particular with respect to programs to which Telephonics supplies materials, could have a material adverse impact on Telephonics' financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows. The U.S. government may not continue to fund programs to which Telephonics’ development projects apply. Even if funding is continued, Telephonics may fail to compete successfully to obtain funding pursuant to such programs. Reductions to funding on existing programs or delays in the funding of new opportunities could affect the timing of revenue recognition, and impact Telephonics' and Griffon's results of operations.Ability of government to fund and conduct its operations The impact of a government shutdown for any duration could have a material adverse effect on Telephonics’ revenues, profits and cash flows. Telephonics relies on government personnel to conduct routine business processes related to the inspection and delivery of products for various programs, to approve and pay certain billings and invoices, to process export licenses and for other administrative services that, if disrupted, could have an immediate impact on Telephonics’ business. Telephonics’ business could be adversely affected by a negative audit by the U.S. Government As a government contractor, and a subcontractor to government contractors, Telephonics is subject to audits and investigations by U.S. Government Agencies such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Defense Security Service, with respect to its classified contracts, other Inspectors General and the Department of Justice. These agencies review a contractor’s performance under its contracts, its cost structure and compliance with applicable laws and standards as well as compliance with applicable regulations, including those relating to facility and personnel security clearances. These agencies also review the adequacy of, and a contractor’s compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the contractor’s management, purchasing, property, estimating, compensation, and accounting and information systems. Any costs found to be misclassified or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed, or must be refunded if already billed and collected. Griffon could incur significant expenses in complying with audits and subpoenas issued by the government in aid of inquiries and investigations. If an audit or an investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, Telephonics may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and/or administrative sanctions, which could include contract termination, forfeiture of profit, suspension of payments, fines, including 20treble damages, and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. Government. In addition, if allegations of impropriety are made, Telephonics and Griffon could suffer serious harm to their reputation. Many of our contracts contain performance obligations that require innovative design capabilities, are technologically complex, or are dependent upon factors not wholly within our control. Failure to meet these obligations could adversely affect customer relations, future business opportunities, and our overall profitability. Telephonics designs, develops and manufactures advanced and innovative surveillance and communication products for a broad range of applications for use in varying environments. As with many of our programs, system specifications, operational requirements and test requirements are challenging, exacerbated by the need for quick delivery schedules. Technical problems encountered and delays in the development or delivery of such products, as well as the inherent discretion involved in government approval related to compliance with applicable specifications of products supplied under government contracts, could prevent us from meeting contractual obligations, which could subject us to termination for default. Under a termination for default, the company is entitled to negotiate payment for undelivered work if the Government requests the transfer of title and delivery of partially completed supplies and materials. Conversely, if the Government does not make this request, there is no obligation to reimburse the company for its costs incurred. We may also be subject to the repayment of advance and progress payments, if any. Additionally, the company may be liable to the Government for any of its excess costs incurred in acquiring supplies and services similar to those terminated for default, and for other damages. Should any of the foregoing events occur, it could result in a material adverse effect on our financial position.Our business could be negatively affected by cyber or other security threats or other disruptions.As a U.S. defense contractor, Telephonics may be the target of cyber security threats to its information technology infrastructure and unauthorized attempts to gain access to sensitive information.  The types of threats could vary from attacks common to most industries to more advanced and persistent, highly organized adversaries who target us because of national security information in our possession.  If we are unable to protect sensitive information, our customers or governmental authorities could question the adequacy of our security processes and procedures and our compliance with evolving government cyber security requirements for government contractors. Due to the evolving nature of these security threats, however, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted.The costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions could be significant.  Security events such as these could adversely affect our internal operations, our future financial results, our reputation, as well as result in the loss of competitive advantages derived from our research and development efforts and other intellectual property.If our subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform their obligations, our performance and our ability to win future business could be harmed.We rely on other companies to provide materials, major components and products to fulfill our contractual obligations. Such arrangements may involve subcontracts, teaming arrangements, or supply agreements with other companies. There is a risk that we may have disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed. In addition, changes in the economic environment, including defense budgets and constraints on available financing, may adversely affect the financial stability of our supply chain and their ability to meet their performance requirements or to provide needed supplies on a timely basis. A disruption or failure of any supplier could have an adverse effect on the business resulting in an impact to profitability, possible termination of a contract, imposition of fines or penalties, and harm to our reputation impacting our ability to secure future business.Griffon’s companies must continually improve existing products, design and sell new products and invest in research and development in order to compete effectively. The markets for Griffon’s products are characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and continuous improvements in products. Due to constant changes in these markets, future success depends on our ability to develop new technologies, products, processes and product applications.  Our long-term success in the competitive retail environment and the industrial and commercial markets depends on our ability to develop and commercialize a continuing stream of innovative new products that are appealing to our ultimate end users and create demand. New product development and commercialization efforts, including efforts to enter markets or product categories in which Griffon has limited or no prior experience, have inherent risks. These risks include the costs involved, such as development and commercialization, product development or launch delays, and the failure of new products and line extensions to achieve anticipated levels of market acceptance or growth in sales or operating income.21Griffon also faces the risk that its competitors will introduce innovative new products that compete with Griffon’s products.  In addition, sales generated by new products could cause a decline in sales of Griffon’s other existing products. If new product development and commercialization efforts are not successful, Griffon’s financial results could be adversely affected.Product and technological developments are accomplished both through internally-funded R&D projects, as well as through strategic partnerships with customers. Because it is not generally possible to predict the amount of time required and costs involved in achieving certain R&D objectives, actual development costs may exceed budgeted amounts and estimated product development schedules may be extended. Griffon’s financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if: •Product improvements are not completed on a timely basis;•New products are not introduced on a timely basis or do not achieve sufficient market penetration;•There are budget overruns or delays in R&D efforts; or•New products experience reliability or quality problems, or otherwise do not meet customer preferences or requirements.Griffon may be unable to implement its acquisition growth strategy, which may result in added expenses without a commensurate increase in revenue and income and divert management’s attention. Making strategic acquisitions is a significant part of Griffon’s growth plans. The ability to successfully complete acquisitions depends on identifying and acquiring, on acceptable terms, companies that either complement or enhance currently held businesses or expand Griffon into new profitable businesses, and, for certain acquisitions, obtaining financing on acceptable terms. Additionally, Griffon must properly integrate acquired businesses in order to maximize profitability. The competition for acquisition candidates is intense and Griffon cannot assure that it will successfully identify acquisition candidates and complete acquisitions at reasonable purchase prices, in a timely manner, or at all. Further, there is a risk that acquisitions will not be properly integrated into Griffon’s existing structure. Griffon closed the acquisitions of La Hacienda, Tuscan Path, ClosetMaid and Harper Brush in the months of July through November 2017, and this integration risk may be exacerbated when numerous acquisitions are consummated in a short time period. In implementing an acquisition growth strategy, the following may be encountered: •Costs associated with incomplete or poorly implemented acquisitions;•Expenses, delays and difficulties of integrating acquired companies into Griffon’s existing organization;•Dilution of the interest of existing stockholders;•Diversion of management’s attention; or•Difficulty in obtaining financing on acceptable terms, or at all.An unsuccessful implementation of Griffon’s acquisition growth strategy could have an adverse impact on Griffon’s results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The loss of certain key officers or employees could adversely affect Griffon’s business. The success of Griffon is materially dependent upon the continued services of certain key officers and employees. The loss of such key personnel could have a material adverse effect on Griffon’s operating results or financial condition. Griffon is exposed to a variety of risks relating to non-U.S. sales and operations, including non-U.S. economic and political conditions and fluctuations in exchange rates.Griffon and its companies conduct operations in Canada, Australia, United Kingdom and China, and sell their products in many countries around the world. Following the ClosetMaid acquisition on October 2, 2017, Griffon now has significant manufacturing operations in Mexico and additional manufacturing operations in China.  Sales of products through non-U.S. subsidiaries accounted for approximately 15% of consolidated revenue for the year ended September 30, 2017. These sales could be adversely affected by changes in political and economic conditions, trade protection measures, the ability of the Company to enter into industrial cooperation agreements (off-set agreements), differing intellectual property rights laws and changes in regulatory requirements that restrict the sales of products or increase costs in such locations. Enforcement of existing laws in such jurisdictions can be uncertain, and the lack of a sophisticated body of laws can create various uncertainties, including with respect to customer and supplier contracts. Currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in the non-U.S. regions in which Griffon does business may also have an impact on future reported financial results.22Our international sales and operations are subject to applicable laws relating to trade, export controls and foreign corrupt practices, the violation of which could adversely affect our operations. We are subject to various anti-corruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. In addition, we are subject to export controls, laws and regulations applicable to us, including the Arms Export Control Act, the International Traffic in Arms Regulation and the Export Administration Regulations, and economic sanctions laws and embargoes imposed by various governments or organizations, including the U.S. and the European Union or member countries. Violations of anti-corruption, export controls, or sanctions laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties, including debarments from export privileges, loss of authorizations needed to conduct our international business, or harm our ability to enter into contracts with the U.S. Government, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Griffon may not be able to protect its proprietary rights. Griffon relies on a combination of patent, copyright and trademark laws, common law, trade secrets, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions to protect proprietary rights. Such measures do not provide absolute protection and Griffon cannot give assurance that measures for protecting these proprietary rights are and will be adequate, or that competitors will not independently develop similar technologies. Griffon may inadvertently infringe on, or may be accused of infringing on, proprietary rights held by another party. Griffon is regularly improving its technology and employing existing technologies in new ways. Though Griffon takes reasonable precautions to ensure it does not infringe on the rights of others, it is possible that Griffon may inadvertently infringe on, or be accused of infringing on, proprietary rights held by others. If Griffon is found to have infringed on the propriety rights held by others, any related litigation or settlement relating to such infringement may have a material effect on Griffon’s business, results of operations and financial condition. Griffon is exposed to product liability and warranty claims. Griffon is subject to product liability and warranty claims in the ordinary course of business, including with respect to former businesses now included within discontinued operations. These claims relate to the conformity of its products with required specifications, and to alleged or actual defects in Griffon’s products (or in end-products in which Griffon’s products were a component part) that cause damage to property or persons. There can be no assurance that the frequency and severity of product liability claims brought against Griffon will not increase, which claims can be brought either by an injured customer of an end product manufacturer who used one of Griffon's products as a component or by a direct purchaser. There is also no assurance that the number and value of warranty claims will not increase as compared to historical claim rates, or that our warranty reserve at any particular time is sufficient. No assurance can be given that indemnification from customers or coverage under insurance policies will be adequate to cover future product liability claims against Griffon; for example, product liability insurance typically does not cover claims for punitive damages. Warranty claims are typically not covered by insurance at all. Product liability insurance can be expensive, difficult to maintain and may be unobtainable in the future on acceptable terms. The amount and scope of any insurance coverage may be inadequate if a product liability claim is successfully asserted. Furthermore, if any significant claims are made, the business and the related financial condition of Griffon may be adversely affected by negative publicity. Griffon has been, and may in the future be, subject to claims and liabilities under environmental laws and regulations.Griffon’s operations and assets are subject to environmental laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment, the handling and disposal of wastes, including solid and hazardous wastes, or otherwise relating to health, safety and protection of the environment, in various jurisdictions in which it operates. Griffon does not expect to make any expenditure with respect to ongoing compliance with or remediation under these environmental laws and regulations that would have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results or financial condition. However, the applicable requirements under environmental laws and regulations may change at any time. Griffon can incur environmental costs related to sites that are no longer owned or operated, as well as third-party sites to which hazardous materials are sent. It cannot be assured that material expenditures or liabilities will not be incurred in connection with such claims. See the Commitment and Contingencies footnote in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on environmental contingencies. Based on facts presently known, the outcome of current environmental matters are not expected to have a material adverse effect on Griffon’s results of operations and financial condition. However, presently unknown environmental conditions, changes in environmental laws and regulations or other unanticipated events may give rise to claims that may involve material expenditures or liabilities. 23Changes in income tax laws and regulations or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect profitability. Griffon is subject to Federal, state and local income taxes in the U.S. and in various taxing jurisdictions outside the U.S. Tax provisions and liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various U.S. and international tax jurisdictions. Griffon’s effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in any valuation allowance for deferred tax assets or the amendment or enactment of tax laws. The amount of income taxes paid is subject to audits by U.S. Federal, state and local tax authorities, as well as tax authorities in the taxing jurisdictions outside the U.S. If such audits result in assessments different from recorded income tax liabilities, Griffon’s future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to its income tax provision. Compliance with restrictions and covenants in Griffon’s debt agreements may limit its ability to take corporate actions. The credit agreement entered into by, and the terms of the senior notes issued by, Griffon each contain covenants that restrict the ability of Griffon and its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional debt, pay dividends, incur liens and make investments, acquisitions, dispositions, restricted payments and capital expenditures. Under the credit agreement, Griffon is also required to comply with specific financial ratios and tests. Griffon may not be able to comply in the future with these covenants or restrictions as a result of events beyond its control, such as prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions or a change in control of Griffon. If Griffon defaults in maintaining compliance with the covenants and restrictions in its credit agreement or the senior notes, its lenders could declare all of the principal and interest amounts outstanding due and payable and, in the case of the credit agreement, terminate their commitments to extend credit to Griffon in the future. If Griffon or its subsidiaries are unable to secure credit in the future, its business could be harmed.Griffon may be unable to raise additional financing if needed Griffon may need to raise additional financing in the future in order to implement its business plan, refinance debt, or to acquire new or complimentary businesses or assets. Any required additional financing may be unavailable, or only available at unfavorable terms, due to uncertainties in the credit markets. If Griffon raises additional funds by issuing equity securities, current holders of its common stock may experience significant ownership interest dilution and the holders of the new securities may have rights senior to the rights associated with current outstanding common stock. Griffon’s indebtedness and interest expense could limit cash flow and adversely affect operations and Griffon’s ability to make full payment on outstanding debt. Griffon’s indebtedness poses potential risks such as: •A substantial portion of cash flows from operations could be used to pay principal and interest on debt, thereby reducing the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, product development and other general corporate purposes;•Insufficient cash flows from operations may force Griffon to sell assets, or seek additional capital, which Griffon may not be able to accomplish on favorable terms, if at all; and•The level of indebtedness may make Griffon more vulnerable to economic or industry downturns.Griffon has the ability to issue additional equity securities, which would lead to dilution of issued and outstanding common stock. The issuance of additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities would result in dilution to existing stockholders’ equity interests. Griffon is authorized to issue, without stockholder vote or approval, 3,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series, and has the ability to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of any such series. Any such series of preferred stock could contain dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices, liquidation preferences or other rights superior to the rights of holders of Griffon’s common stock.  While there is no present intention of issuing any such preferred stock, Griffon reserves the right to do so in the future. In addition, Griffon is authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, up to 85,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 47,106,202 shares, net of treasury shares, were outstanding as of September 30, 2017. Additionally, Griffon is authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, securities convertible into either shares of common stock or preferred stock"
5,GFF,GRIFFON CORP,2016-11-17,"Risk Factors
 Griffon’s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors which could cause Griffon’s actual results to vary materially from recent or anticipated future results. The risk factors discussed in this section should be carefully considered with all of the information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risk factors should not be considered the only risk factors facing Griffon. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that are currently deemed immaterial may also materially impact Griffon’s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows in the future. In general, Griffon is subject to the same general risks and uncertainties that impact other diverse manufacturing companies including, but not limited to, general economic, industry and/or market conditions and growth rates; impact of natural disasters and their effect on global markets; continued events in the Middle East and Asia and possible future terrorist threats and their effect on the worldwide economy; and changes in laws or accounting rules. Griffon has identified the following specific risks and uncertainties that it believes have the potential to materially affect its business and financial condition. Current worldwide economic uncertainty and market volatility could adversely affect Griffon’s businesses. The current worldwide economic uncertainty and market volatility could continue to have an adverse effect on Griffon during 2017, particularly in HBP, which is substantially linked to the U.S. housing market and the U.S. economy in general.   Purchases of AMES' products are discretionary for consumers who are generally more willing to purchase products during periods in which favorable macroeconomic conditions prevail. Additionally, the current condition of the credit markets could impact Griffon’s ability to refinance expiring debt, obtain additional credit for investments in current businesses or for acquisitions, with favorable terms, or may render financing unavailable. Griffon is also exposed to basic economic risks including a decrease in the demand for the products and services it offers or a higher likelihood of default on its receivables. Adverse trends in the housing sector and in general economic conditions will directly impact Griffon’s business. HBP’s business is influenced by market conditions for new home construction and renovation of existing homes. For the year ended September 30, 2016, approximately 53% of Griffon’s consolidated revenue was derived from the HBP segment, which is 15heavily dependent on new home construction and renovation of existing homes. The strength of the U.S. economy, the age of existing home stock, job growth, interest rates, consumer confidence and the availability of consumer credit, as well as demographic factors such as migration into the U.S. and migration of the population within the U.S., also have an effect on HBP.  To the extent market conditions for new home construction and renovation of existing home are weaker than expected, this will likely have an adverse impact on the performance and financial results of the HBP business. Griffon operates in highly competitive industries and may be unable to compete effectively. Griffon’s operating companies face intense competition in each of the markets served. There are a number of competitors, some of which are larger and have greater resources than Griffon’s operating companies. As the economy continues to become more global, Griffon's operating companies may face additional competition from companies that operate in countries with significantly lower operating costs, and as a result, Griffon could lose market share with its customers or may have to lower prices in order to maintain market share.  Griffon competes primarily on the basis of competitive prices, technical expertise, product differentiation, and quality of products and services. There can be no assurance that Griffon will not encounter increased competition in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on Griffon’s financial results.The loss of large customers can harm financial results. A small number of customers account for, and are expected to continue to account for, a substantial portion of Griffon's consolidated revenue. Approximately 13% of consolidated revenue and 51% of the PPC segment revenue for the year ended September 30, 2016 was generated from P&G. Home Depot, Lowe’s, Menards and Bunnings are significant customers of HBP with Home Depot accounting for approximately 13% of consolidated revenue and 24% of HBP's revenue for the year ended September 30, 2016. The U.S. Government and its agencies and subcontractors, including Lockheed Martin and Boeing, is a significant customer of Telephonics, and accounts for approximately 16% of consolidated revenue and 70% of Telephonics segment revenue, inclusive of sales made through Lockheed Martin and Boeing where Telephonics serves as a subcontractor; Lockheed Martin and Boeing each represent less than 10% of consolidated revenue inclusive of such sales to the U.S. Government. Future operating results will continue to substantially depend on the success of Griffon’s largest customers, as well as Griffon’s relationship with them. Orders from these customers are subject to fluctuation and may be reduced materially due to changes in customer needs or other factors. Any reduction or delay in sales of products to one or more of these customers could significantly reduce Griffon’s revenue. Griffon’s operating results will also depend on successfully developing relationships with additional key customers. Griffon cannot assure that its largest customers will be retained or that additional key customers will be recruited. Also, HBP and PPC extend credit to their customers, which exposes them to credit risk. HBP’s largest customer accounted for approximately 26% and 14% of HBP’s and Griffon’s net accounts receivable as of September 30, 2016, respectively. PPC largest customer accounted for approximately 31% and 7% of PPC and Griffon’s net accounts receivable as of September 30, 2016, respectively. If either of these customers were to become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay its debts, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the respective segments and Griffon could be adversely affected. Reliance on third party suppliers and manufacturers may impair AMES' ability to meet its customer demands. AMES relies on a limited number of domestic and foreign companies to supply components and manufacture certain of its products. The percentage of AMES products sourced, based on revenue, approximated 36% in 2016. Reliance on third party suppliers and manufacturers may reduce control over the timing of deliveries and quality of AMES' products. Reduced product quality or failure to deliver products timely may jeopardize relationships with certain of AMES' key customers. In addition, reliance on third party suppliers or manufacturers may result in the failure to meet AMES' customer demands. Continued turbulence in the worldwide economy may affect the liquidity and financial condition of AMES' suppliers. Should any of these parties fail to manufacture sufficient supply, go out of business or discontinue a particular component, alternative suppliers may not be found in a timely manner, if at all. Such events could impact AMES' ability to fill orders, which could have a material adverse effect on customer relationships. If Griffon is unable to obtain raw materials for products at favorable prices it could adversely impact operating performance. HBP’s and PPC's suppliers primarily provide resin, wood and steel.  These segments could experience shortages of raw materials or components for products or be forced to seek alternative sources of supply. If temporary shortages due to disruptions in supply caused by weather, transportation, production delays or other factors require raw materials to be secured from sources other than current suppliers, the terms may not be as favorable as current terms or certain materials may not be available at all. In recent years, HBP and PPC have experienced price increases in steel and plastic resins. While most key raw materials used in Griffon’s businesses are generally available from numerous sources, raw materials are subject to price fluctuations. Because raw materials in the aggregate constitute a significant component of the cost of goods sold, 16price fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on Griffon’s results of operations. Griffon’s ability to pass raw material price increases to customers is limited due to supply arrangements and competitive pricing pressure, and there is generally a time lag between increased raw material costs and implementation of corresponding price increases for Griffon’s products. In particular, sharp increases in raw material prices are more difficult to pass through to customers and may negatively affect short-term financial performance.AMES is subject to risks associated with sourcing from Asia. A substantial amount of AMES finished goods sourcing is done through supply agreements with China based vendors. China does not have a well-developed, consolidated body of laws governing agreements with international customers. Enforcement of existing laws or contracts based on existing law may be uncertain and sporadic, and it may be difficult to obtain swift and equitable enforcement or to obtain enforcement of a judgment by a court of another jurisdiction. The relative inexperience of China’s judiciary on matters of international trade in many cases creates additional uncertainty as to the outcome of any litigation. In addition, interpretation of statutes and regulations may be subject to government policies reflecting domestic political changes. Products entering from China may be subject to import quotas, import duties and other restrictions. Any inability to import these products into the U.S. and any tariffs that may be levied with respect to these products may have a material adverse result on AMES' business and results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Griffon’s businesses are subject to seasonal variations and the impact of uncertain weather patterns. Historically, Griffon’s revenue and income are lowest in our first and fourth quarters ending December 31, and September 30, respectively, and highest in our second and third quarters ending March 31, and June 30, respectively, primarily due to the seasonality of AMES' business.  With the 2014 acquisition of Northcote and Cyclone, both in Australia, AMES' revenue is less susceptible to seasonality.  In 2016, 56% of AMES' sales occurred during the second and third quarters compared to 56% in 2015 and 58% in 2014.    CBP’s business is driven by residential renovation and construction during warm weather, which is generally at reduced levels during the winter months, generally in our second quarter.  Griffon's revenue is expected to be lowest in the first quarter and highest in the third quarter. Demand for lawn and garden products is influenced by weather, particularly weekend weather during the peak gardening season. AMES sales volumes could be adversely affected by certain weather patterns such as unseasonably cool or warm temperatures, hurricanes, water shortages or floods. In addition, lack of snow or lower than average snowfall during the winter season may result in reduced sales of certain AMES products, such as snow shovels and other snow tools. As a result, AMES' results of operations, financial results and cash flows could be adversely impacted. Further consolidation in the retail industry may adversely affect profitability. Home centers and mass merchandisers have consolidated and increased in scale. If this trend continues, customers will likely seek more favorable pricing and other terms for their purchases of products, which will limit Griffon’s ability to pass through raw material or other cost increases, or to raise prices for any reason. Sales on terms less favorable than current terms could have a material adverse effect on profitability. Unionized employees could strike or participate in a work stoppage. Griffon employs approximately 6,000 people on a full-time basis, approximately 7% of whom are covered by collective bargaining or similar labor agreements (all within Telephonics and AMES). If unionized employees engage in a strike or other work stoppage, or if Griffon is unable to negotiate acceptable extensions of agreements with labor unions, a significant disruption of operations and increased operating costs could occur. In addition, any renegotiation or renewal of labor agreements could result in higher wages or benefits paid to unionized employees, which could increase operating costs and could have a material adverse effect on profitability. Griffon may be required to record impairment charges for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.Griffon is required to assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually for impairment or on an interim basis if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest impairment exists. If impairment testing indicates that the carrying value of reporting units or indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds the respective fair value, an impairment charge would be recognized. If goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets were to become impaired, the results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 17Trends in the baby diaper market will directly impact Griffon’s business. Recent trends have been for baby diaper manufacturers to request thinner plastic films for use in their products which reduces the amount of product sold and PPC revenue; this trend has generally resulted in PPC incurring costs to redesign and reengineer products to accommodate required specification changes. Such decreases, or the inability to meet changing customer specifications, could result in a material decline in PPC revenue and profits. Telephonics’ business depends heavily upon government contracts and, therefore, the defense budget. Telephonics sells products to the U.S. government and its agencies both directly and indirectly as a first-tier supplier to prime contractors in the defense industry such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Northrop Grumman. In the year ended September 30, 2016, U.S. government contracts and subcontracts accounted for approximately 16% of Griffon’s consolidated revenue. Contracts involving the U.S. government may include various risks, including: •Termination for default or for convenience by the government;•Reduction or modification in the event of changes in the government’s requirements or budgetary constraints;•Increased or unexpected costs, causing losses or reduced profits under contracts where Telephonics’ prices are fixed, or determinations that certain costs are not allowable under particular government contracts;•The failure or inability of the prime contractor to perform its contract in circumstances where Telephonics is a subcontractor;•Failure to observe and comply with government business practice and procurement regulations such that Telephonics could be suspended or barred from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts;•The failure of the government to exercise options for additional work provided for in contracts;•The inherent discretion of government agencies in determining whether Telephonics has complied with all specifications set forth in a government contract; and•The government’s right, in certain circumstances, to freely use technology developed under these contracts.All of Telephonics’ U.S. Government end-user contracts contain a termination for convenience clause, regardless if Telephonics is the prime contractor or the subcontractor. This clause generally entitles Telephonics, upon a termination for convenience, to receive the purchase price for delivered items, reimbursement of allowable work-in-process costs, and an allowance for profit. Allowable costs would include the costs to terminate existing agreements with suppliers. The programs in which Telephonics participates may extend for several years, and may be funded on an incremental basis. Decreases in the U.S. defense budget, in particular with respect to programs to which Telephonics supplies materials, could have a material adverse impact on Telephonics' financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows. The U.S. government may not continue to fund programs to which Telephonics’ development projects apply. Even if funding is continued, Telephonics may fail to compete successfully to obtain funding pursuant to such programs. Reductions to funding on existing programs or delays in the funding of new opportunities could affect the timing of revenue recognition, and impact Telephonics' and Griffon's results of operations.Ability of government to fund and conduct its operations The impact of a government shutdown for any duration could have a material adverse effect on Telephonics’ revenues, profits and cash flows. Telephonics relies on government personnel to conduct routine business processes related to the inspection and delivery of products for various programs, to approve and pay certain billings and invoices, to process export licenses and for other administrative services that, if disrupted, could have an immediate impact on Telephonics’ business. Telephonics’ business could be adversely affected by a negative audit by the U.S. Government As a government contractor, and a subcontractor to government contractors, Telephonics is subject to audits and investigations by U.S. Government Agencies such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Defense Security Service, with respect to its classified contracts, other Inspectors General and the Department of Justice. These agencies review a contractor’s performance under its contracts, its cost structure and compliance with applicable laws and standards as well as compliance with applicable regulations, including those relating to facility and personnel security clearances. These agencies also review the adequacy of, and a contractor’s compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the contractor’s management, purchasing, property, estimating, compensation, and accounting and information systems. Any costs found to be misclassified or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed, or must be refunded if already billed and collected. Griffon could incur significant expenses in complying with audits and subpoenas issued by the government in aid of inquiries and investigations. If an audit or an investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, Telephonics may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and/or administrative sanctions, which could include contract termination, forfeiture of profit, suspension of payments, fines, including 18treble damages, and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. Government. In addition, if allegations of impropriety are made, Telephonics and Griffon could suffer serious harm to their reputation. Many of our contracts contain performance obligations that require innovative design capabilities, are technologically complex, or are dependent upon factors not wholly within our control. Failure to meet these obligations could adversely affect customer relations, future business opportunities, and our overall profitability. Telephonics designs, develops and manufactures advanced and innovative surveillance and communication products for a broad range of applications for use in varying environments. As with many of our programs, system specifications, operational requirements and test requirements are challenging, exacerbated by the need for quick delivery schedules. Technical problems encountered and delays in the development or delivery of such products, as well as the inherent discretion involved in government approval related to compliance with applicable specifications of products supplied under government contracts, could prevent us from meeting contractual obligations, which could subject us to termination for default. Under a termination for default, the company is entitled to negotiate payment for undelivered work if the Government requests the transfer of title and delivery of partially completed supplies and materials. Conversely, if the Government does not make this request, there is no obligation to reimburse the company for its costs incurred. We may also be subject to the repayment of advance and progress payments, if any. Additionally, the company may be liable to the Government for any of its excess costs incurred in acquiring supplies and services similar to those terminated for default, and for other damages. Should any of the foregoing events occur, it could result in a material adverse effect on our financial position.Our business could be negatively affected by cyber or other security threats or other disruptions.As a U.S. defense contractor, Telephonics may be the target of cyber security threats to its information technology infrastructure and unauthorized attempts to gain access to sensitive information.  The types of threats could vary from attacks common to most industries to more advanced and persistent, highly organized adversaries who target us because of national security information in our possession.  If we are unable to protect sensitive information, our customers or governmental authorities could question the adequacy of our security processes and procedures and our compliance with evolving government cyber security requirements for government contractors. Due to the evolving nature of these security threats, however, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted.The costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions could be significant.  Security events such as these could adversely affect our internal operations, our future financial results, our reputation, as well as result in the loss of competitive advantages derived from our research and development efforts and other intellectual property.If our subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform their obligations, our performance and our ability to win future business could be harmed.We rely on other companies to provide materials, major components and products to fulfill our contractual obligations. Such arrangements may involve subcontracts, teaming arrangements, or supply agreements with other companies. There is a risk that we may have disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed. In addition, changes in the economic environment, including defense budgets and constraints on available financing, may adversely affect the financial stability of our supply chain and their ability to meet their performance requirements or to provide needed supplies on a timely basis. A disruption or failure of any supplier could have an adverse effect on the business resulting in an impact to profitability, possible termination of a contract, imposition of fines or penalties, and harm to our reputation impacting our ability to secure future business.Griffon’s companies must continually improve existing products, design and sell new products and invest in research and development in order to compete effectively. The markets for PPC and Telephonics are characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and continuous improvements in products. Due to constant changes in these markets, future success depends on their ability to develop new technologies, products, processes and product applications. 19Product and technological developments are accomplished both through internally-funded R&D projects, as well as through strategic partnerships with customers. Because it is not generally possible to predict the amount of time required and costs involved in achieving certain R&D objectives, actual development costs may exceed budgeted amounts and estimated product development schedules may be extended. Griffon’s financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if: •Product improvements are not completed on a timely basis;•New products are not introduced on a timely basis or do not achieve sufficient market penetration;•There are budget overruns or delays in R&D efforts; or•New products experience reliability or quality problems, or otherwise do not meet customer preferences or requirements.Griffon may be unable to implement its acquisition growth strategy, which may result in added expenses without a commensurate increase in revenue and income and divert management’s attention. Making strategic acquisitions is a significant part of Griffon’s growth plans. The ability to successfully complete acquisitions depends on identifying and acquiring, on acceptable terms, companies that either complement or enhance currently held businesses or expand Griffon into new profitable businesses, and, for certain acquisitions, obtaining financing on acceptable terms. Additionally, Griffon must properly integrate acquired businesses in order to maximize profitability. The competition for acquisition candidates is intense and Griffon cannot assure that it will successfully identify acquisition candidates and complete acquisitions at reasonable purchase prices, in a timely manner, or at all. Further, there is a risk that acquisitions will not be properly integrated into Griffon’s existing structure. In implementing an acquisition growth strategy, the following may be encountered: •Costs associated with incomplete or poorly implemented acquisitions;•Expenses, delays and difficulties of integrating acquired companies into Griffon’s existing organization;•Dilution of the interest of existing stockholders;•Diversion of management’s attention; or•Difficulty in obtaining financing on acceptable terms, or at all.An unsuccessful implementation of Griffon’s acquisition growth strategy could have an adverse impact on Griffon’s results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The loss of certain key officers or employees could adversely affect Griffon’s business. The success of Griffon is materially dependent upon the continued services of certain key officers and employees. The loss of such key personnel could have a material adverse effect on Griffon’s operating results or financial condition. Griffon is exposed to a variety of risks relating to non-U.S. sales and operations, including non-U.S. economic and political conditions and fluctuations in exchange rates.Griffon and its companies conduct operations in Germany, Canada, Brazil, Australia and China, and sell their products in many countries around the world. Sales of products through non-U.S. subsidiaries accounted for approximately 20% of consolidated revenue for the year ended September 30, 2016. These sales could be adversely affected by changes in political and economic conditions, trade protection measures, the ability of the Company to enter into industrial cooperation agreements (off-set agreements), differing intellectual property rights laws and changes in regulatory requirements that restrict the sales of products or increase costs in such locations. Enforcement of existing laws in such jurisdictions can be uncertain, and the lack of a sophisticated body of laws can create various uncertainties, including with respect to customer and supplier contracts. Currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in the non-U.S. regions in which Griffon does business may also have an impact on future reported financial results.Our international sales and operations are subject to applicable laws relating to trade, export controls and foreign corrupt practices, the violation of which could adversely affect our operations. We are subject to various anti-corruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. In addition, we are subject to export controls, laws and regulations applicable to us, including the Arms Export Control Act, the International Traffic in Arms Regulation and the Export Administration Regulations, and economic sanctions laws and embargoes imposed by various governments or organizations, including the U.S. and the European Union or member countries. Violations of anti-corruption, export controls, or sanctions laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties, including debarments from export privileges, loss of authorizations needed to conduct our international business, or harm our ability to enter into contracts with the U.S. Government, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.20Griffon may not be able to protect its proprietary rights. Griffon relies on a combination of patent, copyright and trademark laws, common law, trade secrets, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions to protect proprietary rights. Such measures do not provide absolute protection and Griffon cannot give assurance that measures for protecting these proprietary rights are and will be adequate, or that competitors will not independently develop similar technologies. Griffon may inadvertently infringe on, or may be accused of infringing on, proprietary rights held by another party. Griffon is regularly improving its technology and employing existing technologies in new ways. Though Griffon takes reasonable precautions to ensure it does not infringe on the rights of others, it is possible that Griffon may inadvertently infringe on, or be accused of infringing on, proprietary rights held by others. If Griffon is found to have infringed on the propriety rights held by others, any related litigation or settlement relating to such infringement may have a material effect on Griffon’s business, results of operations and financial condition. Griffon is exposed to product liability and warranty claims. Griffon is subject to product liability and warranty claims in the ordinary course of business, including with respect to former businesses now included within discontinued operations. These claims relate to the conformity of its products with required specifications, and to alleged or actual defects in Griffon’s products (or in end-products in which Griffon’s products were a component part) that cause damage to property or persons. There can be no assurance that the frequency and severity of product liability claims brought against Griffon will not increase, which claims can be brought either by an injured customer of an end product manufacturer who used one of Griffon's products as a component or by a direct purchaser. There is also no assurance that the number and value of warranty claims will not increase as compared to historical claim rates, or that our warranty reserve at any particular time is sufficient. No assurance can be given that indemnification from customers or coverage under insurance policies will be adequate to cover future product liability claims against Griffon; for example, product liability insurance typically does not cover claims for punitive damages. Warranty claims are typically not covered by insurance at all. Product liability insurance can be expensive, difficult to maintain and may be unobtainable in the future on acceptable terms. The amount and scope of any insurance coverage may be inadequate if a product liability claim is successfully asserted. Furthermore, if any significant claims are made, the business and the related financial condition of Griffon may be adversely affected by negative publicity. Griffon has been, and may in the future be, subject to claims and liabilities under environmental laws and regulations.Griffon’s operations and assets are subject to environmental laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment, the handling and disposal of wastes, including solid and hazardous wastes, or otherwise relating to health, safety and protection of the environment, in various jurisdictions in which it operates. Griffon does not expect to make any expenditure with respect to ongoing compliance with or remediation under these environmental laws and regulations that would have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results or financial condition. However, the applicable requirements under environmental laws and regulations may change at any time. Griffon can incur environmental costs related to sites that are no longer owned or operated, as well as third-party sites to which hazardous materials are sent. It cannot be assured that material expenditures or liabilities will not be incurred in connection with such claims. See the Commitment and Contingencies footnote in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on environmental contingencies. Based on facts presently known, the outcome of current environmental matters are not expected to have a material adverse effect on Griffon’s results of operations and financial condition. However, presently unknown environmental conditions, changes in environmental laws and regulations or other unanticipated events may give rise to claims that may involve material expenditures or liabilities. Changes in income tax laws and regulations or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect profitability. Griffon is subject to Federal, state and local income taxes in the U.S. and in various taxing jurisdictions outside the U.S. Tax provisions and liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various U.S. and international tax jurisdictions. Griffon’s effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in any valuation allowance for deferred tax assets or the amendment or enactment of tax laws. The amount of income taxes paid is subject to audits by U.S. Federal, state and local tax authorities, as well as tax authorities in the taxing jurisdictions outside the U.S. If such audits result in assessments different from recorded income tax liabilities, Griffon’s future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to its income tax provision. 21Compliance with restrictions and covenants in Griffon’s debt agreements may limit its ability to take corporate actions. The credit agreement entered into by, and the terms of the senior notes issued by, Griffon each contain covenants that restrict the ability of Griffon and its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional debt, pay dividends, incur liens and make investments, acquisitions, dispositions, restricted payments and capital expenditures. Under the credit agreement, Griffon is also required to comply with specific financial ratios and tests. Griffon may not be able to comply in the future with these covenants or restrictions as a result of events beyond its control, such as prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions or a change in control of Griffon. If Griffon defaults in maintaining compliance with the covenants and restrictions in its credit agreement or the senior notes, its lenders could declare all of the principal and interest amounts outstanding due and payable and, in the case of the credit agreement, terminate their commitments to extend credit to Griffon in the future. If Griffon or its subsidiaries are unable to secure credit in the future, its business could be harmed.The conversion contingency provision of the convertible notes may cause reported earnings per share to be more volatile, and may cause a dilutive impact to existing stockholdersThe outstanding convertible notes are convertible at maturity. Under the terms of the 2017 Notes, Griffon has the right to settle the conversion of the 2017 Notes in cash, stock or a combination of cash and stock.  On July 14, 2016, Griffon announced that it will settle, upon conversion, up to $125,000 of the conversion value of the 2017 Notes in cash, with amounts in excess of $125,000, if any, to be settled in shares of Griffon common stock. The potential shares of Griffon common stock issuable for the amount, if any, in excess of $125,000 of conversion value of the notes are considered in the calculation of diluted earnings per share and volatility in Griffon’s stock price could cause these notes to be dilutive at one point in time and not at another point in time. In addition, to the extent the conversion value of the notes is in excess of $125,000 at maturity, there will be a dilutive impact to existing holders of Griffon’s common stock.Griffon may be unable to raise additional financing if needed Griffon may need to raise additional financing in the future in order to implement its business plan, refinance debt, or to acquire new or complimentary businesses or assets. Any required additional financing may be unavailable, or only available at unfavorable terms, due to uncertainties in the credit markets. If Griffon raises additional funds by issuing equity securities, current holders of its common stock may experience significant ownership interest dilution and the holders of the new securities may have rights senior to the rights associated with current outstanding common stock. Griffon’s indebtedness and interest expense could limit cash flow and adversely affect operations and Griffon’s ability to make full payment on outstanding debt. Griffon’s indebtedness poses potential risks such as: •A substantial portion of cash flows from operations could be used to pay principal and interest on debt, thereby reducing the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, product development and other general corporate purposes;•Insufficient cash flows from operations may force Griffon to sell assets, or seek additional capital, which Griffon may not be able to accomplish on favorable terms, if at all; and•The level of indebtedness may make Griffon more vulnerable to economic or industry downturns.Griffon has the ability to issue additional equity securities, which would lead to dilution of issued and outstanding common stock. The issuance of additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities would result in dilution to existing stockholders’ equity interests. Griffon is authorized to issue, without stockholder vote or approval, 4,200,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series, and has the ability to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of any such series. Any such series of preferred stock could contain dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices, liquidation preferences or other rights superior to the rights of holders of Griffon’s common stock.  While there is no present intention of issuing any such preferred stock, Griffon reserves the right to do so in the future. In addition, Griffon is authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, up to 85,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 45,169,758 shares, net of treasury shares, were outstanding as of September 30, 2016. Additionally, Griffon is authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, securities convertible into either shares of common stock or preferred stock. "
3,GFF,GRIFFON CORP,2015-11-12,"Risk Factors
 Griffon’s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors which could cause Griffon’s actual results to vary materially from recent or anticipated future results. The risk factors discussed in this section should be carefully considered with all of the information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risk factors should not be considered the only risk factors facing Griffon. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that are currently deemed immaterial may also materially impact Griffon’s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows in the future. In general, Griffon is subject to the same general risks and uncertainties that impact other diverse manufacturing companies including, but not limited to, general economic, industry and/or market conditions and growth rates; impact of natural disasters and their effect on global markets; continued events in the Middle East and Asia and possible future terrorist threats and their effect on the worldwide economy; and changes in laws or accounting rules. Griffon has identified the following specific risks and uncertainties that it believes have the potential to materially affect its business and financial condition. Current worldwide economic uncertainty and market volatility could adversely affect Griffon’s businesses. The current worldwide economic uncertainty and market volatility could continue to have an adverse effect on Griffon during 2016, particularly in HBP, which is substantially linked to the U.S. housing market and the U.S. economy in general.   Purchases of AMES' products are discretionary for consumers who are generally more willing to purchase products during periods in which favorable macroeconomic conditions prevail. Additionally, the current condition of the credit markets could impact Griffon’s ability to refinance expiring debt, obtain additional credit for investments in current businesses or for acquisitions, with favorable terms, or may render financing unavailable. Griffon is also exposed to basic economic risks including a decrease in the demand for the products and services it offers or a higher likelihood of default on its receivables. Adverse trends in the housing sector and in general economic conditions will directly impact Griffon’s business. HBP’s business is influenced by market conditions for new home construction and renovation of existing homes. For the year ended September 30, 2015, approximately 52% of Griffon’s consolidated revenue was derived from the HBP segment, which is heavily dependent on new home construction and renovation of existing homes. The strength of the U.S. economy, the age of 14existing home stock, job growth, interest rates, consumer confidence and the availability of consumer credit, as well as demographic factors such as migration into the U.S. and migration of the population within the U.S., also have an effect on HBP. In that respect, the significant downturn in the housing market has had an adverse effect on the operating results of HBP and this effect is likely to continue in 2016, particularly with respect to CBP. Griffon operates in highly competitive industries and may be unable to compete effectively. Griffon’s operating companies face intense competition in each of the markets served. There are a number of competitors, some of which are larger and have greater resources than Griffon’s operating companies. Griffon competes primarily on the basis of competitive prices, technical expertise, product differentiation, and quality of products and services. There can be no assurance that Griffon will not encounter increased competition in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on Griffon’s financial results.The loss of large customers can harm financial results. A small number of customers account for, and are expected to continue to account for, a substantial portion of Griffon's consolidated revenue. Approximately 14% of consolidated revenue and 51% of the PPC segment revenue for the year ended September 30, 2015 was generated from P&G. Home Depot, Lowe’s, Menards and Bunnings are significant customers of HBP with Home Depot accounting for approximately 12% of consolidated revenue and 23% of HBP's revenue for the year ended September 30, 2015. The U.S. Government and its agencies and subcontractors, including Lockheed Martin and Boeing, is a significant customer of Telephonics, and accounts for approximately 14% of consolidated revenue and 66% of Telephonics segment revenue, inclusive of sales made through Lockheed Martin and Boeing where Telephonics serves as a subcontractor; Lockheed Martin and Boeing each represent less than 10% of consolidated revenue inclusive of such sales to the U.S. Government. Future operating results will continue to substantially depend on the success of Griffon’s largest customers, as well as Griffon’s relationship with them. Orders from these customers are subject to fluctuation and may be reduced materially due to changes in customer needs or other factors. Any reduction or delay in sales of products to one or more of these customers could significantly reduce Griffon’s revenue. Griffon’s operating results will also depend on successfully developing relationships with additional key customers. Griffon cannot assure that its largest customers will be retained or that additional key customers will be recruited. Also, HBP and PPC extend credit to their customers, which expose them to credit risk. HBP’s largest customer accounted for approximately 19% and 10% of HBP’s and Griffon’s net accounts receivable as of September 30, 2015, respectively. PPC largest customer accounted for approximately 34% and 8% of PPC and Griffon’s net accounts receivable as of September 30, 2015, respectively. If either of these customers were to become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay its debts, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the respective segments and Griffon could be adversely affected. Reliance on third party suppliers and manufacturers may impair AMES' ability to meet its customer demands. AMES relies on a limited number of domestic and foreign companies to supply components and manufacture certain of its products. The percentage of AMES products sourced, based on revenue, approximated 41% in 2015. Reliance on third party suppliers and manufacturers may reduce control over the timing of deliveries and quality of AMES' products. Reduced product quality or failure to deliver products timely may jeopardize relationships with certain of AMES' key customers. In addition, reliance on third party suppliers or manufacturers may result in the failure to meet AMES' customer demands. Continued turbulence in the worldwide economy may affect the liquidity and financial condition of AMES' suppliers. Should any of these parties fail to manufacture sufficient supply, go out of business or discontinue a particular component, alternative suppliers may not be found in a timely manner, if at all. Such events could impact AMES' ability to fill orders, which could have a material adverse effect on customer relationships. If Griffon is unable to obtain raw materials for products at favorable prices it could adversely impact operating performance. HBP’s and PPC suppliers primarily provide resin, wood and steel. Assurance cannot be provided that these segments will not experience shortages of raw materials or components for products or be forced to seek alternative sources of supply. If temporary shortages due to disruptions in supply caused by weather, transportation, production delays or other factors require raw materials to be secured from sources other than current suppliers, the terms may not be as favorable as current terms or certain materials may not be available at all. In recent years, HBP and PPC have experienced price increases in steel and plastic resins. While most key raw materials used in Griffon’s businesses are generally available from numerous sources, raw materials are subject to price fluctuations. Because raw materials in the aggregate constitute a significant component of the cost of goods sold, price fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on Griffon’s results of operations. Griffon’s ability to pass raw material price increases to customers is limited due to supply arrangements and competitive pricing pressure, and there is generally a time lag between increased raw material costs and implementation of corresponding price increases for Griffon’s products. In particular, 15sharp increases in raw material prices are more difficult to pass through to customers and may negatively affect short-term financial performance.AMES is subject to risks associated with sourcing from Asia. A substantial amount of AMES finished goods sourcing is done through supply agreements with China based vendors. China does not have a well-developed, consolidated body of laws governing agreements with international customers. Enforcement of existing laws or contracts based on existing law may be uncertain and sporadic, and it may be difficult to obtain swift and equitable enforcement or to obtain enforcement of a judgment by a court of another jurisdiction. The relative inexperience of China’s judiciary on matters of international trade in many cases creates additional uncertainty as to the outcome of any litigation. In addition, interpretation of statutes and regulations may be subject to government policies reflecting domestic political changes. Products entering from China may be subject to import quotas, import duties and other restrictions. Any inability to import these products into the U.S. and any tariffs that may be levied with respect to these products may have a material adverse result on AMES' business and results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Griffon’s businesses are subject to seasonal variations and the impact of uncertain weather patterns. Historically, Griffon’s revenue and income are lowest in our first and fourth quarters ending December 31, and September 30, respectively, and highest in our second and third quarters ending March 31, and June 30, respectively, primarily due to the seasonality of AMES' business.  With the 2014 acquisition of Northcote and Cyclone, both in Australia, AMES' revenue is less susceptible to seasonality.  In 2015, 56% of AMES' sales occurred during the second and third quarters compared to 58% in 2014 and 63% in 2013.    CBP’s business is driven by residential renovation and construction during warm weather, which is generally at reduced levels during the winter months, generally in our second quarter.  Griffon's revenue is expected to be lowest in the first quarter and highest in the third quarter. Demand for lawn and garden products is influenced by weather, particularly weekend weather during the peak gardening season. AMES sales volumes could be adversely affected by certain weather patterns such as unseasonably cool or warm temperatures, hurricanes, water shortages or floods. In addition, lack of snow or lower than average snowfall during the winter season may result in reduced sales of certain AMES products, such as snow shovels and other snow tools. As a result, AMES' results of operations, financial results and cash flows could be adversely impacted. Further consolidation in the retail industry may adversely affect profitability. Home centers and mass merchandisers have consolidated and increased in scale. If this trend continues, customers will likely seek more favorable pricing and other terms for their purchases of products, which will limit Griffon’s ability to pass through raw material or other cost increases, or to raise prices for any reason. Sales on terms less favorable than current terms could have a material adverse effect on profitability. Unionized employees could strike or participate in a work stoppage. Griffon employs approximately 6,000 people on a full-time basis, approximately 8% of whom are covered by collective bargaining or similar labor agreements (all within Telephonics and AMES). If unionized employees engage in a strike or other work stoppage, or if Griffon is unable to negotiate acceptable extensions of agreements with labor unions, a significant disruption of operations and increased operating costs could occur. In addition, any renegotiation or renewal of labor agreements could result in higher wages or benefits paid to unionized employees, which could increase operating costs and could have a material adverse effect on profitability. Griffon may be required to record impairment charges for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.Griffon is required to assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually for impairment or on an interim basis if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest impairment exists. If impairment testing indicates that the carrying value of reporting units or indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds the respective fair value, an impairment charge would be recognized. If goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets were to become impaired, the results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Trends in the baby diaper market will directly impact Griffon’s business. Recent trends have been for baby diaper manufacturers to request thinner plastic films for use in their products which reduces the amount of product sold and PPC revenue; this trend has generally resulted in PPC incurring costs to redesign and reengineer 16products to accommodate required specification changes. Such decreases, or the inability to meet changing customer specifications, could result in a material decline in PPC revenue and profits. Telephonics’ business depends heavily upon government contracts and, therefore, the defense budget. Telephonics sells products to the U.S. government and its agencies both directly and indirectly as a first-tier supplier to prime contractors in the defense industry such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Sikorsky and Northrop Grumman. In the year ended September 30, 2015, U.S. government contracts and subcontracts accounted for approximately 14% of Griffon’s consolidated revenue. Contracts involving the U.S. government may include various risks, including: •Termination for default or for convenience by the government;•Reduction or modification in the event of changes in the government’s requirements or budgetary constraints;•Increased or unexpected costs, causing losses or reduced profits under contracts where Telephonics’ prices are fixed, or determinations that certain costs are not allowable under particular government contracts;•The failure or inability of the prime contractor to perform its contract in circumstances where Telephonics is a subcontractor;•Failure to observe and comply with government business practice and procurement regulations such that Telephonics could be suspended or barred from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts;•The failure of the government to exercise options for additional work provided for in contracts; and•The government’s right, in certain circumstances, to freely use technology developed under these contracts.All of Telephonics’ U.S. Government end-user contracts contain a termination for convenience clause, regardless if Telephonics is the prime contractor or the subcontractor. This clause generally entitles Telephonics, upon a termination for convenience, to receive the purchase price for delivered items, reimbursement of allowable work-in-process costs, and an allowance for profit. Allowable costs would include the costs to terminate existing agreements with suppliers. The programs in which Telephonics participates may extend for several years, and may be funded on an incremental basis. Decreases in the U.S. defense budget, in particular with respect to programs to which Telephonics supplies materials, could have a material adverse impact on Telephonics' financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows. The U.S. government may not continue to fund programs to which Telephonics’ development projects apply. Even if funding is continued, Telephonics may fail to compete successfully to obtain funding pursuant to such programs. Reductions to funding on existing programs or delays in the funding of new opportunities could affect the timing of revenue recognition, and impact Telephonics' and Griffon's results of operations.The Budget Control Act called for additional substantial, mandatory defense spending reductions, known as “sequestration.” There continues to be much uncertainty regarding how sequestration will be implemented. There are many variables in how the law could be applied that make it difficult to determine the specific impacts; however, we expect that sequestration will result in lower revenues, profits and cash flows for Telephonics. Ability of government to fund and conduct its operations The impact of a government shutdown for any duration could have a material adverse effect on Telephonics’ revenues, profits and cash flows. Telephonics relies on government personnel to conduct routine business processes related to the inspection and delivery of products for various programs, to approve and pay certain billings and invoices, to process export licenses and for other administrative services that, if disrupted, could have an immediate impact on Telephonics’ business. Telephonics’ business could be adversely affected by a negative audit by the U.S. Government As a government contractor, and a subcontractor to government contractors, Telephonics is subject to audits and investigations by U.S. Government Agencies such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Defense Security Service, with respect to its classified contracts, other Inspectors General and the Department of Justice. These agencies review a contractor’s performance under its contracts, its cost structure and compliance with applicable laws and standards as well as compliance with applicable regulations, including those relating to facility and personnel security clearances. These agencies also review the adequacy of, and a contractor’s compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the contractor’s management, purchasing, property, estimating, compensation, and accounting and information systems. Any costs found to be misclassified or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed, or must be refunded if already billed and collected. Griffon could incur significant expenses in complying with audits and subpoenas issued by the government in aid of inquiries and investigations. If an audit or an investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, Telephonics may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and/or administrative sanctions, which could include contract termination, forfeiture of profit, suspension of payments, fines, including treble damages, and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. Government. In addition, if allegations of impropriety are made, Telephonics and Griffon could suffer serious harm to their reputation.17 Many of our contracts contain performance obligations that require innovative design capabilities, are technologically complex, or are dependent upon factors not wholly within our control. Failure to meet these obligations could adversely affect customer relations, future business opportunities, and our overall profitability. Telephonics designs, develops and manufactures advanced and innovative surveillance and communication products for a broad range of applications for use in varying environments. As with many of our programs, system specifications, operational requirements and test requirements are challenging, exacerbated by the need for quick delivery schedules. Technical problems encountered and delays in the development or delivery of such products, as well as the inherent discretion involved in government approval related to compliance with applicable specifications of products supplied under government contracts, could prevent us from meeting contractual obligations, which could subject us to termination for default. Under a termination for default, the company is entitled to negotiate payment for undelivered work if the Government requests the transfer of title and delivery of partially completed supplies and materials. Conversely, if the Government does not make this request, there is no obligation to reimburse the company for its costs incurred. We may also be subject to the repayment of advance and progress payments, if any. Additionally, the company may be liable to the Government for any of its excess costs incurred in acquiring supplies and services similar to those terminated for default, and for other damages. Should any of the foregoing events occur, it could result in a material adverse effect on our financial position.Our business could be negatively affected by cyber or other security threats or other disruptions.As a U.S. defense contractor, Telephonics may be the target of cyber security threats to its information technology infrastructure and unauthorized attempts to gain access to sensitive information.  The types of threats could vary from attacks common to most industries to more advanced and persistent, highly organized adversaries who target us because of national security information in our possession.  If we are unable to protect sensitive information, our customers or governmental authorities could question the adequacy of our security processes and procedures and our compliance with evolving government cyber security requirements for government contractors. Due to the evolving nature of these security threats, however, the impact of any future incident cannot be predicted.The costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions could be significant.  Security events such as these could adversely affect our internal operations, our future financial results, our reputation, as well as result in the loss of competitive advantages derived from our research and development efforts and other intellectual property.If our subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform their obligations, our performance and our ability to win future business could be harmed.We rely on other companies to provide materials, major components and products to fulfill our contractual obligations. Such arrangements may involve subcontracts, teaming arrangements, or supply agreements with other companies. There is a risk that we may have disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed. In addition, changes in the economic environment, including defense budgets and constraints on available financing, may adversely affect the financial stability of our supply chain and their ability to meet their performance requirements or to provide needed supplies on a timely basis. A disruption or failure of any supplier could have an adverse effect on the business resulting in an impact to profitability, possible termination of a contract, imposition of fines or penalties, and harm to our reputation impacting our ability to secure future business.Griffon’s companies must continually improve existing products, design and sell new products and invest in research and development in order to compete effectively. The markets for PPC and Telephonics are characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and continuous improvements in products. Due to constant changes in these markets, future success depends on their ability to develop new technologies, products, processes and product applications. Product and technological developments are accomplished both through internally-funded R&D projects, as well as through strategic partnerships with customers. Because it is not generally possible to predict the amount of time required and costs involved in achieving certain R&D objectives, actual development costs may exceed budgeted amounts and estimated product development schedules may be extended. Griffon’s financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if: •Product improvements are not completed on a timely basis;•New products are not introduced on a timely basis or do not achieve sufficient market penetration;18•There are budget overruns or delays in R&D efforts; or•New products experience reliability or quality problems, or otherwise do not meet customer preferences or requirements.Griffon may be unable to implement its acquisition growth strategy, which may result in added expenses without a commensurate increase in revenue and income and divert management’s attention. Making strategic acquisitions is a significant part of Griffon’s growth plans. The ability to successfully complete acquisitions depends on identifying and acquiring, on acceptable terms, companies that either complement or enhance currently held businesses or expand Griffon into new profitable businesses, and, for certain acquisitions, obtaining financing on acceptable terms. Additionally, Griffon must properly integrate acquired businesses in order to maximize profitability. The competition for acquisition candidates is intense and Griffon cannot assure that it will successfully identify acquisition candidates and complete acquisitions at reasonable purchase prices, in a timely manner, or at all. Further, there is a risk that acquisitions will not be properly integrated into Griffon’s existing structure. In implementing an acquisition growth strategy, the following may be encountered: •Costs associated with incomplete or poorly implemented acquisitions;•Expenses, delays and difficulties of integrating acquired companies into Griffon’s existing organization;•Dilution of the interest of existing stockholders;•Diversion of management’s attention; or•Difficulty in obtaining financing on acceptable terms, or at all.An unsuccessful implementation of Griffon’s acquisition growth strategy could have an adverse impact on Griffon’s results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The loss of certain key officers or employees could adversely affect Griffon’s business. The success of Griffon is materially dependent upon the continued services of certain key officers and employees. The loss of such key personnel could have a material adverse effect on Griffon’s operating results or financial condition. Griffon is exposed to a variety of risks relating to non-U.S. sales and operations, including non-U.S. economic and political conditions and fluctuations in exchange rates.Griffon and its companies conduct operations in Germany, Canada, Brazil, Australia and China, and sell their products in many countries around the world. Sales of products through non-U.S. subsidiaries accounted for approximately 21% of consolidated revenue for the year ended September 30, 2015. These sales could be adversely affected by changes in political and economic conditions, trade protection measures, the ability of the Company to enter into industrial cooperation agreements (off-set agreements), differing intellectual property rights laws and changes in regulatory requirements that restrict the sales of products or increase costs in such locations. Enforcement of existing laws in such jurisdictions can be uncertain, and the lack of a sophisticated body of laws can create various uncertainties, including with respect to customer and supplier contracts. Currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in the non-U.S. regions in which Griffon does business may also have an impact on future reported financial results.Our international sales and operations are subject to applicable laws relating to trade, export controls and foreign corrupt practices, the violation of which could adversely affect our operations. We are subject to various anti-corruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. In addition, we are subject to export controls, laws and regulations applicable to us, including the Arms Export Control Act, the International Traffic in Arms Regulation and the Export Administration Regulations, and economic sanctions laws and embargoes imposed by various governments or organizations, including the U.S. and the European Union or member countries. Violations of anti-corruption, export controls, or sanctions laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties, including debarments from export privileges, loss of authorizations needed to conduct our international business, or harm our ability to enter into contracts with the U.S. Government, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Griffon may not be able to protect its proprietary rights. Griffon relies on a combination of patent, copyright and trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions to protect proprietary rights. Such measures do not provide absolute protection and Griffon cannot give assurance that measures for protecting these proprietary rights are and will be adequate, or that competitors will not independently develop similar technologies. 19Griffon may inadvertently infringe on, or may be accused of infringing on, proprietary rights held by another party. Griffon is regularly improving its technology and employing existing technologies in new ways. Though Griffon takes reasonable precautions to ensure it does not infringe on the rights of others, it is possible that Griffon may inadvertently infringe on, or may be accused of infringing on, proprietary rights held by others. If Griffon is found to have infringed on the propriety rights held by others, any related litigation or settlement relating to such infringement may have a material effect on Griffon’s business, results of operations and financial condition. Griffon is exposed to product liability and warranty claims. Griffon is subject to product liability and warranty claims in the ordinary course of business, including with respect to former businesses now included within discontinued operations. These claims relate to the conformity of its products with required specifications, and to alleged or actual defects in Griffon’s products (or in end-products in which Griffon’s products were a component part) that cause damage to property or persons. There can be no assurance that the frequency and severity of product liability claims brought against Griffon will not increase, which claims can be brought either by an injured customer of an end product manufacturer who used one of the products as a component or by a direct purchaser. There is also no assurance that the number and value of warranty claims will not increase as compared to historical claim rates, or that our warranty reserve at any particular time is sufficient. No assurance can be given that indemnification from customers or coverage under insurance policies will be adequate to cover future product liability claims against Griffon; for example, product liability insurance typically does not cover claims for punitive damages. Warranty claims are typically not covered by insurance at all. Product liability insurance can be expensive, difficult to maintain and may be unobtainable in the future on acceptable terms. The amount and scope of any insurance coverage may be inadequate if a product liability claim is successfully asserted. Furthermore, if any significant claims are made, the business and the related financial condition of Griffon may be adversely affected by negative publicity. Griffon has been, and may in the future be, subject to claims and liabilities under environmental laws and regulations.Griffon’s operations and assets are subject to environmental laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment, the handling and disposal of wastes, including solid and hazardous wastes, or otherwise relating to health, safety and protection of the environment, in various jurisdictions in which it operates. Griffon does not expect to make any expenditure with respect to ongoing compliance with or remediation under these environmental laws and regulations that would have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results or financial condition. However, the applicable requirements under environmental laws and regulations may change at any time. Griffon can incur environmental costs related to sites that are no longer owned or operated, as well as third-party sites to which hazardous materials are sent. It cannot be assured that material expenditures or liabilities will not be incurred in connection with such claims. See the Commitment and Contingencies footnote in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on environmental contingencies. Based on facts presently known, the outcome of current environmental matters are not expected to have a material adverse effect on Griffon’s results of operations and financial condition. However, presently unknown environmental conditions, changes in environmental laws and regulations or other unanticipated events may give rise to claims that may involve material expenditures or liabilities. Changes in income tax laws and regulations or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect profitability. Griffon is subject to Federal, state and local income taxes in the U.S. and in various taxing jurisdictions outside the U.S. Tax provisions and liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various U.S. and international tax jurisdictions. Griffon’s effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in any valuation allowance for deferred tax assets or the amendment or enactment of tax laws. The amount of income taxes paid is subject to audits by U.S. Federal, state and local tax authorities, as well as tax authorities in the taxing jurisdictions outside the U.S. If such audits result in assessments different from recorded income tax liabilities, Griffon’s future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to its income tax provision. Compliance with restrictions and covenants in Griffon’s debt agreements may limit its ability to take corporate actions. The credit agreement entered into by, and the terms of the senior notes issued by, Griffon each contain covenants that restrict the ability of Griffon and its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional debt, pay dividends, incur liens and make investments, acquisitions, dispositions, restricted payments and capital expenditures. Under the credit agreement, Griffon is also required to comply with specific financial ratios and tests. Griffon may not be able to comply in the future with these covenants or restrictions as a result of events beyond its control, such as prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions or a change in control of Griffon. If Griffon defaults in maintaining compliance with the covenants and restrictions in its credit agreement or the senior 20notes, its lenders could declare all of the principal and interest amounts outstanding due and payable and, in the case of the credit agreement, terminate their commitments to extend credit to Griffon in the future. If Griffon or its subsidiaries are unable to secure credit in the future, its business could be harmed. Reported earnings per share may be more volatile because of the conversion contingency provision of the notes. The outstanding convertible notes are convertible when a “market price” condition is satisfied and also upon the occurrence of other circumstances as more fully described in the Notes Payable, Capitalized Leases and Long-Term Debt footnote in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Upon conversion, at Griffon’s discretion, note holders will receive $1 in cash for each $1 principal amount of notes presented for conversion or an equivalent value in Griffon’s common stock, and Griffon common stock for the value above the principal amount of the notes. The potential shares of Griffon common stock issuable for value above the principal value of the notes are considered in the calculation of diluted earnings per share and volatility in Griffon’s stock price could cause these notes to be dilutive in one quarter and not in a subsequent quarter, increasing the volatility of fully diluted earnings per share.Griffon may be unable to raise additional financing if needed Griffon may need to raise additional financing in the future in order to implement its business plan, refinance debt, or to acquire new or complimentary businesses or assets. Any required additional financing may be unavailable, or only available at unfavorable terms, due to uncertainties in the credit markets. If Griffon raises additional funds by issuing equity securities, current holders of its common stock may experience significant ownership interest dilution and the holders of the new securities may have rights senior to the rights associated with current outstanding common stock. Griffon’s indebtedness and interest expense could limit cash flow and adversely affect operations and Griffon’s ability to make full payment on outstanding debt. Griffon’s indebtedness poses potential risks such as: •A substantial portion of cash flows from operations could be used to pay principal and interest on debt, thereby reducing the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, product development and other general corporate purposes;•Insufficient cash flows from operations may force Griffon to sell assets, or seek additional capital, which Griffon may not be able to accomplish on favorable terms, if at all; and•The level of indebtedness may make Griffon more vulnerable to economic or industry downturns.Griffon has the ability to issue additional equity securities, which would lead to dilution of issued and outstanding common stock. The issuance of additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities would result in dilution to existing stockholders’ equity interests. Griffon is authorized to issue, without stockholder vote or approval, 4,200,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series, and has the ability to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of any such series. Any such series of preferred stock could contain dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices, liquidation preferences or other rights superior to the rights of holders of Griffon’s common stock.  While there is no present intention of issuing any such preferred stock, Griffon reserves the right to do so in the future. In addition, Griffon is authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, up to 85,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 48,343,192 shares, net of treasury shares, were outstanding as of September 30, 2015. Additionally, Griffon is authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, securities convertible into either shares of common stock or preferred stock. "
8,GFF,GRIFFON CORP,2014-11-13,"Risk Factors
 Griffon’s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be impacted by a number of factors which could cause Griffon’s actual results to vary materially from recent or anticipated future results. The risk factors discussed in this section should be carefully considered with all of the information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risk factors should not be considered the only risk factors facing Griffon. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that are currently deemed immaterial may also materially impact Griffon’s business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows in the future. In general, Griffon is subject to the same general risks and uncertainties that impact other diverse manufacturing companies including, but not limited to, general economic, industry and/or market conditions and growth rates; impact of natural disasters and their effect on global markets; continued events in the Middle East and Asia and possible future terrorist threats and their effect on the worldwide economy; and changes in laws or accounting rules. Griffon has identified the following specific risks and uncertainties that it believes have the potential to materially affect its business and financial condition. Current worldwide economic uncertainty and market volatility could adversely affect Griffon’s businesses. The current worldwide economic uncertainty and market volatility could continue to have an adverse effect on Griffon during 2015, particularly in HBP, which is substantially linked to the U.S. housing market and the U.S. economy in general. Also, purchases of AMES' products are discretionary for consumers who are generally more willing to purchase products during periods in which favorable macroeconomic conditions prevail. Additionally, the current condition of the credit markets could impact Griffon’s ability to refinance expiring debt, obtain additional credit for investments in current businesses or for acquisitions, with favorable terms, or there may be no financing available. Griffon is also exposed to basic economic risks including a decrease in the demand for the products and services it offers or a higher likelihood of default on its receivables. Adverse trends in the housing sector and in general economic conditions will directly impact Griffon’s business. HBP’s business is influenced by market conditions for new home construction and renovation of existing homes. For the year ended September 30, 2014, approximately 49% of Griffon’s consolidated revenue was derived from the HBP segment, which is heavily dependent on new home construction and renovation of existing homes. The strength of the U.S. economy, the age of existing home stock, job growth, interest rates, consumer confidence and the availability of consumer credit, as well as demographic factors such as migration into the U.S. and migration of the population within the U.S., also have an effect on HBP. In that respect, 13the significant downturn in the housing market has had an adverse effect on the operating results of HBP and this effect is likely to continue in 2015, particularly with respect to CBP business. Griffon operates in highly competitive industries and may be unable to compete effectively. Griffon’s operating companies face intense competition in each of the markets served. There are a number of competitors, some of which are larger and have greater resources than Griffon’s operating companies. Griffon competes primarily on the basis of competitive prices, technical expertise, product differentiation, and quality of products and services. There can be no assurance that Griffon will not encounter increased competition in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on Griffon’s financial results.The loss of large customers can harm financial results. A small number of customers account for, and are expected to continue to account for, a substantial portion of Griffon's consolidated revenue. Approximately 14% of consolidated revenue and 46% of the Plastics segment revenue for the year ended September 30, 2014 was generated from P&G. Home Depot, Lowe’s, Menards and Bunnings are significant customers of HBP with Home Depot accounting for approximately 12% of consolidated revenue and 23% of HBP's revenue for the year ended September 30, 2014. The U.S. Government and its agencies and subcontractors, including Lockheed Martin and Boeing, is a significant customer of Telephonics, and accounts for approximately 15% of consolidated revenue and 72% of Telephonics segment revenue, inclusive of sales made through Lockheed Martin and Boeing where Telephonics serves as a subcontractor; Lockheed Martin and Boeing each represent less than 10% of consolidated revenue inclusive of such sales to the U.S. Government. Future operating results will continue to substantially depend on the success of Griffon’s largest customers, as well as Griffon’s relationship with them. Orders from these customers are subject to fluctuation and may be reduced materially due to changes in customer needs. Any reduction or delay in sales of products to one or more of these customers could significantly reduce Griffon’s revenue. Griffon’s operating results will also depend on successfully developing relationships with additional key customers. Griffon cannot assure that its largest customers will be retained or that additional key customers will be recruited. Also, HBP and Plastics extend credit to their customers, which exposes them to credit risk. HBP’s largest customer accounted for approximately 18% and 9% of HBP’s and Griffon’s net accounts receivable as of September 30, 2014, respectively. Plastics’ largest customer accounted for approximately 27% and 7% of Plastics' and Griffon’s net accounts receivable as of September 30, 2014, respectively. If either of these customers were to become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay its debts, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the respective segments and Griffon could be adversely affected. Reliance on third party suppliers and manufacturers may impair AMES' ability to meet its customer demands. AMES relies on a limited number of domestic and foreign companies to supply components and manufacture certain of its products. The percentage of AMES products sourced, based on revenue, approximated 41% in 2014. Reliance on third party suppliers and manufacturers may reduce control over the timing of deliveries and quality of AMES' products. Reduced product quality or failure to deliver products timely may jeopardize relationships with certain of AMES' key customers. In addition, reliance on third party suppliers or manufacturers may result in failure to meet AMES' customer demands. Continued turbulence in the worldwide economy may affect the liquidity and financial condition of AMES' suppliers. Should any of these parties fail to manufacture sufficient supply, go out of business or discontinue a particular component, alternative suppliers may not be found in a timely manner, if at all. Such events could impact AMES' ability to fill orders, which could have a material adverse effect on customer relationships. If Griffon is unable to obtain raw materials for products at favorable prices it could adversely impact operating performance. HBP’s and Plastics’ suppliers primarily provide resin, wood and steel. Assurance cannot be provided that these segments will not experience shortages of raw materials or components for products or be forced to seek alternative sources of supply. If temporary shortages due to disruptions in supply caused by weather, transportation, production delays or other factors require raw materials to be secured from sources other than current suppliers, the terms may not be as favorable as current terms or certain materials may not be available at all. In recent years, HBP and Plastics have experienced price increases in steel and plastic resins. While most key raw materials used in Griffon’s businesses are generally available from numerous sources, raw materials are subject to price fluctuations. Because raw materials in the aggregate constitute a significant component of the cost of goods sold, price fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on Griffon’s results of operations. Griffon’s ability to pass raw material price increases to customers is limited due to supply arrangements and competitive pricing pressure, and there is generally a time lag between increased raw material costs and implementation of corresponding price increases for Griffon’s products. In particular, sharp increases in raw material prices are more difficult to pass through to customers and may negatively affect short-term financial performance.14AMES is subject to risks associated with sourcing from Asia. A substantial amount of AMES finished goods sourcing is done through supply agreements with China based vendors. China does not have a well-developed, consolidated body of laws governing agreements with international customers. Enforcement of existing laws or contracts based on existing law may be uncertain and sporadic, and it may be difficult to obtain swift and equitable enforcement or to obtain enforcement of a judgment by a court of another jurisdiction. The relative inexperience of China’s judiciary in many cases creates additional uncertainty as to the outcome of any litigation. In addition, interpretation of statutes and regulations may be subject to government policies reflecting domestic political changes. Products entering from China may be subject to import quotas, import duties and other restrictions. Any inability to import these products into the U.S. and any tariffs that may be levied with respect to these products may have a material adverse result on AMES' business and results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Griffon’s businesses are subject to seasonal variations and the impact of uncertain weather patterns. Historically, Griffon’s revenue and income are lowest in our first and fourth quarters ending December 31, and September 30, respectively, and highest in our second and third quarters ending March 31, and June 30, respectively, primarily due to the seasonality of AMES' business.  With the 2014 acquisition of Northcote and Cyclone, both in Australia, AMES' revenue is less susceptible to seasonality. In 2014, 58% of AMES' sales occurred during the second and third quarters compared to 63% in 2013.  CBP’s business is driven by residential renovation and construction during warm weather, which is generally at reduced levels during the winter months, generally in our second quarter.  Griffon's revenue is expected to be lowest in the first quarter and highest in the third quarter. Demand for lawn and garden products is influenced by weather, particularly weekend weather during the peak gardening season. AMES sales volumes could be adversely affected by certain weather patterns such as unseasonably cool or warm temperatures, hurricanes, water shortages or floods. In addition, lack of snow or lower than average snowfall during the winter season may result in reduced sales of certain AMES products, such as snow shovels and other snow tools. As a result, AMES' results of operations, financial results and cash flows could be adversely impacted. Further consolidation in the retail industry may adversely affect profitability. Home centers and mass merchandisers have consolidated and increased in scale. If this trend continues, customers will likely seek more favorable terms for their purchases of products, which will limit Griffon’s ability to pass through raw material or other cost increases, or to raise prices for any reason. Sales on terms less favorable than current terms could have a material adverse effect on profitability. Unionized employees could strike or participate in a work stoppage. Griffon employs approximately 6,100 people on a full-time basis, approximately 8% of whom are covered by collective bargaining or similar labor agreements (all within Telephonics and AMES). If unionized employees engage in a strike or other work stoppage, or if Griffon is unable to negotiate acceptable extensions of agreements with labor unions, a significant disruption of operations and increased operating costs could occur. In addition, any renegotiation or renewal of labor agreements could result in higher wages or benefits paid to unionized employees, which could increase operating costs and could have a material adverse effect on profitability. Griffon may be required to record impairment charges for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.Griffon is required to assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually for impairment or on an interim basis if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest impairment exists. If impairment testing indicates that the carrying value of reporting units or indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds the respective fair value, an impairment charge would be recognized. If goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets were to become impaired, the results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Trends in the baby diaper market will directly impact Griffon’s business. Recent trends have been for baby diaper manufacturers to specify thinner plastic films for use in their products which reduces the amount of product sold and Plastics’ revenue; this trend has generally resulted in Plastics incurring costs to redesign and reengineer products to accommodate required specification changes. Such decreases, or the inability to meet changing customer specifications, could result in a material decline in Plastics revenue and profits. 15Telephonics’ business depends heavily upon government contracts and, therefore, the defense budget. Telephonics sells products to the U.S. government and its agencies both directly and indirectly as a first-tier supplier to prime contractors in the defense industry such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Sikorsky and Northrop Grumman. In the year ended September 30, 2014, U.S. government contracts and subcontracts accounted for approximately 15% of Griffon’s consolidated revenue. Contracts involving the U.S. government may include various risks, including: •Termination for default or for convenience by the government;•Reduction or modification in the event of changes in the government’s requirements or budgetary constraints;•Increased or unexpected costs, causing losses or reduced profits under contracts where Telephonics’ prices are fixed, or determinations that certain costs are not allowable under particular government contracts;•The failure or inability of the prime contractor to perform its contract in circumstances where Telephonics is a subcontractor;•Failure to observe and comply with government business practice and procurement regulations such that Telephonics could be suspended or barred from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts;•The failure of the government to exercise options for additional work provided for in contracts; and•The government’s right, in certain circumstances, to freely use technology developed under these contracts.All of Telephonics’ U.S. Government end-user contracts contain a termination for convenience clause, regardless if Telephonics is the prime contractor or the subcontractor. This clause generally entitles Telephonics, upon a termination for convenience, to receive the purchase price for delivered items, reimbursement of allowable work-in-process costs, and an allowance for profit. Allowable costs would include the costs to terminate existing agreements with suppliers. The programs in which Telephonics participates may extend for several years, and may be funded on an incremental basis. Decreases in the U.S. defense budget, in particular with respect to programs to which Telephonics supplies materials, could have a material adverse impact on Telephonics financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows. The U.S. government may not continue to fund programs to which Telephonics’ development projects apply. Even if funding is continued, Telephonics may fail to compete successfully to obtain funding pursuant to such programs. Reductions to funding on existing programs or delays in the funding of new opportunities could affect the timing of revenue recognition, and impact Telephonics' and Griffon's results of operations.In 2014, the Budget Control Act called for additional substantial, mandatory defense spending reductions, known as “sequestration.” There continues to be much uncertainty regarding how sequestration will be implemented. There are many variables in how the law could be applied that make it difficult to determine the specific impacts; however, we expect that sequestration will result in lower revenues, profits and cash flows for Telephonics. Ability of government to fund and conduct its operations The impact of a government shutdown for any duration could have a material adverse effect on Telephonics’ revenues, profits and cash flows. Telephonics relies on government personnel to conduct routine business processes related to the inspection and delivery of products for various programs, to approve and pay certain billings and invoices, and for other administrative services that, if disrupted, could have an immediate impact on Telephonics’ business related to government programs. Telephonics’ business could be adversely affected by a negative audit by the U.S. Government As a government contractor, and a subcontractor to government contractors, Telephonics is subject to audits and investigations by U.S. Government Agencies such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Defense Security Service, with respect to its classified contracts, other Inspectors General and the Department of Justice. These agencies review a contractor’s performance under its contracts, its cost structure and compliance with applicable laws and standards as well as compliance with applicable regulations, including those relating to facility and personnel security clearances. These agencies also review the adequacy of, and a contractor’s compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the contractor’s management, purchasing, property, estimating, compensation, and accounting and information systems. Any costs found to be misclassified or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed, or must be refunded if already billed and collected. Griffon could incur significant expenses in complying with audits and subpoenas issued by the government in aid of inquiries and investigations. If an audit or an investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, Telephonics may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and/or administrative sanctions, which could include contract termination, forfeiture of profit, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. Government. In addition, if allegations of impropriety are made, Telephonics and Griffon could suffer serious reputational harm. 16Many of our contracts contain performance obligations that require innovative design capabilities, are technologically complex, or are dependent upon factors not wholly within our control. Failure to meet these obligations could adversely affect customer relations, future business opportunities, and our overall profitability. Telephonics designs, develops and manufactures advanced and innovative surveillance and communication products for a broad range of applications for use in varying environments. As with many of our programs, system specifications, operational requirements and test requirements are challenging, exacerbated by the need for quick delivery schedules. Technical problems encountered and delays in the development or delivery of such products, as well as the inherent discretion involved in government approval related to compliance with applicable specifications of products supplied under government contracts, could prevent us from meeting contractual obligations, which could subject us to termination for default. Under a termination for default, the company is entitled to negotiate payment for undelivered work if the Government requests the transfer of title and delivery of partially completed supplies and materials. Conversely, if the Government does not make this request, there is no obligation to reimburse the company for its costs incurred. We may also be subject to the repayment of advance and progress payments, if any. Additionally, the company may be liable to the Government for any of its excess costs incurred in acquiring supplies and services similar to those terminated for default, and for other damages. Should any of the foregoing events occur, it could result in a material adverse effect on our financial position.Griffon’s companies must continually improve existing products, design and sell new products and invest in research and development in order to compete effectively. The markets for Plastics and Telephonics are characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and continuous improvements in products. Due to constant changes in these markets, future success depends on their ability to develop new technologies, products, processes and product applications. Product and technological developments are accomplished both through internally-funded R&D projects, as well as through strategic partnerships with customers. Because it is not generally possible to predict the amount of time required and costs involved in achieving certain R&D objectives, actual development costs may exceed budgeted amounts and estimated product development schedules may be extended. Griffon’s financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if: •Product improvements are not completed on a timely basis;•New products are not introduced on a timely basis or do not achieve sufficient market penetration;•There are budget overruns or delays in R&D efforts; or•New products experience reliability or quality problems.Griffon may be unable to implement its acquisition growth strategy, which may result in added expenses without a commensurate increase in revenue and income and divert management’s attention. Making strategic acquisitions is a significant part of Griffon’s growth plans. The ability to successfully complete acquisitions depends on identifying and acquiring, on acceptable terms, companies that either complement or enhance currently held businesses or expand Griffon into new profitable businesses, and, for certain acquisitions, obtaining financing on acceptable terms. Additionally, Griffon must properly integrate acquired businesses in order to maximize profitability. The competition for acquisition candidates is intense and Griffon cannot assure that it will successfully identify acquisition candidates and complete acquisitions at reasonable purchase prices, in a timely manner, or at all. Further, there is a risk that acquisitions will not be properly integrated into Griffon’s existing structure. In implementing an acquisition growth strategy, the following may be encountered: •Costs associated with incomplete or poorly implemented acquisitions;•Expenses, delays and difficulties of integrating acquired companies into Griffon’s existing organization;•Dilution of the interest of existing stockholders;•Diversion of management’s attention; or•Difficulty in obtaining financing on acceptable terms, or at all.An unsuccessful implementation of Griffon’s acquisition growth strategy could have an adverse impact on Griffon’s results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. The loss of certain key officers or employees could adversely affect Griffon’s business. The success of Griffon is materially dependent upon the continued services of certain key officers and employees. The loss of such key personnel could have a material adverse effect on Griffon’s operating results or financial condition. 17Griffon is exposed to a variety of risks relating to non-U.S. sales and operations, including non-U.S. economic and political conditions and fluctuations in exchange rates.Griffon and its companies conduct operations in Germany, Canada, Brazil, Australia, Turkey and China, and sell their products in many countries around the world. Sales of products through non-U.S. subsidiaries accounted for approximately 24% of consolidated revenue for the year ended September 30, 2014. These sales could be adversely affected by changes in political and economic conditions, trade protection measures, the ability of the Company to enter into industrial cooperation agreements (off-set agreements), differing intellectual property rights laws and changes in regulatory requirements that restrict the sales of products or increase costs in such locations. Enforcement of existing laws in such jurisdictions can be uncertain, and the lack of a sophisticated body of laws can create various uncertainties, including with respect to customer and supplier contracts. Currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in the non-U.S. regions in which Griffon does business may also have an impact on future reported financial results.Our international sales and operations are subject to applicable laws relating to trade, export controls and foreign corrupt practices, the violation of which could adversely affect our operations. We are subject to various anti-corruption laws that prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. In addition, we are subject to export controls, laws and regulations applicable to us, including the Arms Export Control Act, the International Traffic in Arms Regulation and the Export Administration Regulations, and economic sanctions laws and embargoes imposed by various governments or organizations, including the U.S. and the European Union or member countries. Violations of anti-corruption, export controls, or sanctions laws may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties, including debarments from export privileges, loss of authorizations needed to conduct our international business, or harm our ability to enter into contracts with the U.S. Government, and we may be subject to other liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.Griffon may not be able to protect its proprietary rights. Griffon relies on a combination of patent, copyright and trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions to protect proprietary rights. Such measures do not provide absolute protection and Griffon cannot give assurance that measures for protecting these proprietary rights are and will be adequate, or that competitors will not independently develop similar technologies. Griffon may inadvertently infringe on, or may be accused of infringing on, proprietary rights held by another party. Griffon is regularly improving its technology and employing existing technologies in new ways. Though Griffon takes reasonable precautions to ensure it does not infringe on the rights of others, it is possible that Griffon may inadvertently infringe on, or may be accused of infringing on, proprietary rights held by others. If Griffon is found to have infringed on the propriety rights held by others, any related litigation or settlement relating to such infringement may have a material effect on Griffon’s business, results of operations and financial condition. Griffon is exposed to product liability and warranty claims. Griffon is subject to product liability and warranty claims in the ordinary course of business, including with respect to former businesses now included within discontinued operations. These claims relate to the conformity of its products with required specifications, and to alleged or actual defects in Griffon’s products (or in end-products in which Griffon’s products were a component part) that cause damage to property or persons. There can be no assurance that future product liability claims will not be brought against Griffon, either by an injured customer of an end product manufacturer who used one of the products as a component or by a direct purchaser. There is also no assurance that the number and value of warranty claims will not increase as compared to historical claim rates, or that our warranty reserve at any particular time is sufficient. No assurance can be given that indemnification from customers or coverage under insurance policies will be adequate to cover future product liability claims against Griffon; for example, product liability insurance typically does not cover claims for punitive damages. Warranty claims are typically not covered by insurance at all. Product liability insurance can be expensive, difficult to maintain and may be unobtainable in the future on acceptable terms. The amount and scope of any insurance coverage may be inadequate if a product liability claim is successfully asserted. Furthermore, if any significant claims are made, the business and the related financial condition of Griffon may be adversely affected by negative publicity. Griffon has been, and may in the future be, subject to claims and liabilities under environmental laws and regulations.Griffon’s operations and assets are subject to environmental laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment, the handling and disposal of wastes, including solid and hazardous wastes, or otherwise relating to health, safety 18and protection of the environment, in various jurisdictions in which it operates. Griffon does not expect to make any expenditure with respect to ongoing compliance with or remediation under these environmental laws and regulations that would have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results or financial condition. However, the applicable requirements under environmental laws and regulations may change at any time. Griffon can incur environmental costs related to sites that are no longer owned or operated, as well as third-party sites to which hazardous materials are sent. It cannot be assured that material expenditures or liabilities will not be incurred in connection with such claims. See the Commitment and Contingencies footnote in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on environmental contingencies. Based on facts presently known, the outcome of current environmental matters are not expected to have a material adverse effect on Griffon’s results of operations and financial condition. However, presently unknown environmental conditions, changes in environmental laws and regulations or other unanticipated events may give rise to claims that may involve material expenditures or liabilities. Changes in income tax laws and regulations or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect profitability. Griffon is subject to Federal, state and local income taxes in the U.S. and in various taxing jurisdictions outside the U.S. Tax provisions and liabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various U.S. and international tax jurisdictions. Griffon’s effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in any valuation allowance for deferred tax assets or the amendment or enactment of tax laws. The amount of income taxes paid is subject to audits by U.S. Federal, state and local tax authorities, as well as tax authorities in the taxing jurisdictions outside the U.S. If such audits result in assessments different from recorded income tax liabilities, Griffon’s future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments to its income tax provision. Compliance with restrictions and covenants in Griffon’s debt agreements may limit its ability to take corporate actions. The senior secured credit agreement entered into by, and the terms of the senior notes issued by, Griffon each contain covenants that restrict the ability of Griffon and its subsidiaries to, among other things, incur additional debt, pay dividends, incur liens and make investments, acquisitions, dispositions, restricted payments and capital expenditures. Under the credit agreement, Griffon is also required to comply with specific financial ratios and tests. Griffon may not be able to comply in the future with these covenants or restrictions as a result of events beyond its control, such as prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions or a change in control of Griffon. If Griffon defaults in maintaining compliance with the covenants and restrictions in its credit agreement or the senior notes, its lenders could declare all of the principal and interest amounts outstanding due and payable and, in the case of the credit agreement, terminate their commitments to extend credit to Griffon in the future. If Griffon or its subsidiaries are unable to secure credit in the future, its business could be harmed. Reported earnings per share may be more volatile because of the conversion contingency provision of the notes. The outstanding convertible notes are convertible when a “market price” condition is satisfied and also upon the occurrence of other circumstances as more fully described in the Notes Payable, Capitalized Leases and Long-Term Debt footnote in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Upon conversion, at Griffon’s discretion, note holders will receive $1 in cash for each $1 principal amount of notes presented for conversion or an equivalent value in Griffon’s common stock, and Griffon common stock for the value above the principal amount of the notes. The potential shares of Griffon common stock issuable for value above the principal value of the notes are considered in the calculation of diluted earnings per share and volatility in Griffon’s stock price could cause these notes to be dilutive in one quarter and not in a subsequent quarter, increasing the volatility of fully diluted earnings per share.Griffon may be unable to raise additional financing if needed Griffon may need to raise additional financing in the future in order to implement its business plan, refinance debt, or to acquire new or complimentary businesses or assets. Any required additional financing may be unavailable, or only available at unfavorable terms, due to uncertainties in the credit markets. If Griffon raises additional funds by issuing equity securities, current holders of its common stock may experience significant ownership interest dilution and the holders of the new securities may have rights senior to the rights associated with current outstanding common stock. Griffon’s indebtedness and interest expense could limit cash flow and adversely affect operations and Griffon’s ability to make full payment on outstanding debt. Griffon’s indebtedness poses potential risks such as: 19•A substantial portion of cash flows from operations could be used to pay principal and interest on debt, thereby reducing the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, product development and other general corporate purposes;•Insufficient cash flows from operations may force Griffon to sell assets, or seek additional capital, which Griffon may not be able to accomplish on favorable terms, if at all; and•The level of indebtedness may make Griffon more vulnerable to economic or industry downturns.Griffon has the ability to issue additional equity securities, which would lead to dilution of issued and outstanding common stock. The issuance of additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities would result in dilution to existing stockholders’ equity interests. Griffon is authorized to issue, without stockholder vote or approval, 4,200,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series, and has the ability to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of any such series. Any such series of preferred stock could contain dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices, liquidation preferences or other rights superior to the rights of holders of Griffon’s common stock. There is no present intention of issuing any such preferred stock, but Griffon reserves the right to do so in the future. In addition, Griffon is authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, up to 85,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 53,148,612 shares, net of treasury shares, were outstanding as of September 30, 2014. Additionally, Griffon is authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, securities convertible into either shares of common stock or preferred stock. "
11,GFF,GRIFFON CORP,2012-11-16,"Risk Factors
Griffons business, financial condition, operating results and cashflows can be impacted by a number of factors which could cause Griffons actualresults to vary materially from recent or anticipated future results. The riskfactors discussed in this section should be carefully considered with all ofthe information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risk factors shouldnot be considered the only risk factors facing Griffon. Additional risks anduncertainties not presently known or that are currently deemed immaterial mayalso materially impact Griffons business, financial condition, operatingresults and cash flows in the future.In general, Griffon is subject to the same general risks anduncertainties that impact other diverse manufacturing companies including, butnot limited to, general economic, industry and/or market conditions and growthrates; impact of natural disasters and their effect on global markets;continued events in the Middle East and possible future terrorist threats andtheir effect on the worldwide economy; and changes in laws or accounting rules.Griffon has identified the following specific risks and uncertainties that itbelieves have the potential to materially affect its business and financialcondition.Current worldwide economic uncertainty andmarket volatility could adversely affect Griffons businesses. The current worldwide economic uncertainty, market volatility andcredit crisis will continue to have an adverse effect on Griffon during 2013,particularly in HBP, which is substantially linked to the U.S. housing marketand the U.S. economy, in general. Also, purchases of ATT products arediscretionary for consumers and consumers are generally more willing topurchase products during periods in which favorable macroeconomic conditionsprevail. Additionally, the current condition of the credit markets could impactGriffons ability to refinance expiring debt, obtain additional credit forinvestments in current businesses or for acquisitions, with favorable terms, orthere may be no financing available. Griffon is also exposed to basic economicrisks including a decrease in the demand for the products and services offeredor a higher risk of default on its receivables. Adverse trends in the housing sector and ingeneral economic conditions will directly impact Griffons business.HBPs business is influenced by market conditions for new homeconstruction and renovation of existing homes. For the year ended September 30,2012, approximately 46% of Griffons consolidated revenue was derived from theHBP segment, which is heavily dependent on new home construction and renovationof existing homes. The strength of the U.S. economy, the age of existing homestock, job growth, interest rates, consumer confidence and the availability ofconsumer credit, as well as demographic factors such as the migration into theUnited States and migration of the population within the United States alsohave an effect on HBP. In that respect, the significant downturn in the housingmarket has had an adverse effect on the operating results of HBP and thiseffect is likely to continue in 2013, particularly to its CBP business.Griffon operates in highly competitiveindustries and may be unable to compete effectively.Griffons operating companies face intense competition in each of themarkets served. There are a number of competitors, some of which are larger andhave greater resources than Griffons operating companies. Griffon competesprimarily on the basis of competitive prices, technical expertise, productdifferentiation, and quality of products and services. There can be noassurance that Griffon will not encounter increased competition in the future,which could have a material adverse effect on Griffons financial results.17The loss of large customers can harm financial results.A small number of customers account for, and are expected to continueto account for, a substantial portion of consolidated revenue. Approximately13% of consolidated revenue and 43% of the Plastics segment revenue for theyear ended September 30, 2012 was generated from P&G, the largest customerin the Plastics segment. Home Depot, Lowes and Menards are significantcustomers of HBP with Home Depot accounting for approximately 12% ofconsolidated revenue and 25% of the HBP segment revenue for the year endedSeptember 30, 2012. The U.S. Government and its agencies, Lockheed MartinCorporation and the Boeing Company, are significant customers of Telephonics.Future operating results will continue to substantially depend on the successof Griffons largest customers, as well as Griffons relationship with them.Orders from these customers are subject to fluctuation and may be reducedmaterially due to changes in these customers needs. Any reduction or delay insales of products to one or more of these customers could significantly reduceGriffons revenue. Griffons operating results will also depend on successfullydeveloping relationships with additional key customers. Griffon cannot assurethat Griffons largest customers will be retained or that additional keycustomers will be recruited. Also, HBP extends credit to its customers, whichexposes it to credit risk. Their largest customer accounted for approximately22% and 9% of HBPs and Griffons net accounts receivable as of September 30,2012, respectively. If this customer were to become insolvent or otherwiseunable to pay its debts, the financial condition, results of operations andcash flows of the HBP segment would be adversely affected.Reliance on thirdparty suppliers and manufacturers may impair ability to meet ATTs customerdemands.ATT relies on a limited number of domestic and foreign companies tosupply components and manufacture certain of its products. The percentage ofATTs products sourced, based on revenue, approximated 34% in 2012. Reliance onthird party suppliers and manufacturers may reduce control over the timing ofdeliveries and quality of ATTs products. Reduced product quality or failure todeliver products quickly may jeopardize relationships with certain of ATTs keycustomers. In addition, reliance on third party suppliers or manufacturers mayresult in failure to meet ATTs customer demands. Continued turbulence in theworldwide economy may affect the liquidity and financial condition of ATTssuppliers. Should any of these parties fail to manufacture sufficient supply,go out of business or discontinue a particular component, alternative suppliersmay not be found in a timely manner, if at all. Such events could impact ATTsability to fill orders, which would have a material adverse effect on customerrelationships.If Griffon is unableto obtain raw materials for products at favorable prices it could adverselyimpact operating performance.HBPs and Plastics suppliers primarily provide resin, wood and steel.Assurance cannot be provided that these segments may not experience shortagesof raw materials or components for products or be forced to seek alternativesources of supply. If temporary shortages due to disruptions in supply causedby weather, transportation, production delays or other factors require rawmaterials to be secured from sources other than current suppliers, the termsmay not be as favorable as current terms or material may not be available atall. In recent years, HBP and Plastics have experienced price increases insteel and plastic resins.While most key raw materials used in Griffons businesses are generallyavailable from numerous sources, raw materials are subject to pricefluctuations. Because raw materials in the aggregate constitute a significantcomponent of the cost of goods sold, price fluctuations could have a materialadverse effect on Griffons results of operations. Griffons ability to passraw material price increases to customers is limited due to supply arrangementsand competitive pricing pressure, and there is generally a time lag betweenincreased raw material costs and implementation of corresponding priceincreases for Griffons products. In particular, sharp increases in rawmaterial prices are more difficult to pass through to customers and maynegatively affect short-term financial performance.18ATT is subject torisks associated with sourcing from Asia.A substantial amount of ATTs finished goods sourcing is done throughsupply agreements with China based vendors. China does not have awell-developed, consolidated body of laws governing agreements withinternational customers. Enforcement of existing laws or contracts based onexisting law may be uncertain and sporadic, and it may be difficult to obtainswift and equitable enforcement or to obtain enforcement of a judgment by acourt of another jurisdiction. The relative inexperience of Chinas judiciaryin many cases creates additional uncertainty as to the outcome of anylitigation. In addition, interpretation of statutes and regulations may besubject to government policies reflecting domestic political changes. Productsentering from China may be subject to import quotas, import duties and otherrestrictions. Any inability to import these products into the U.S. and anytariffs that may be levied with respect to these products may have a materialadverse result on ATTs business and results of operations, financial positionand cash flows.Griffons businesses are subject to seasonalvariations and the impact of uncertain weather patterns.Generally, Griffons revenue and income are lowest in our first andfourth quarters ending December 31 and September 30, respectively, and highestin our second and third quarters ending March 31 and June 30, respectively,primarily due to the seasonality of ATTs business. ATTs lawn and gardenproducts are used primarily in the spring and summer; in 2012 61% of ATTssales occurred during the second and third quarters. CBPs business is drivenby residential renovation and construction during warm weather, which isgenerally at reduced levels during the winter months. Demand for lawn and garden products is influenced by weather,particularly weekend weather during the peak gardening season. ATTs salesvolumes could be adversely affected by certain weather patterns such asunseasonably cool or warm temperatures, hurricanes, water shortages or floods.In addition, lack of snow or lower than average snowfall during the winterseason may also result in reduced sales of certain ATT products, such as snowshovels and other snow tools. As a result, ATTs results of operations,financial results and cash flows could be adversely impacted.Furtherconsolidation in the retail industry may adversely affect profitability.Home centers and mass merchandisers have consolidated and increased inscale. If this trend continues, customers will likely seek more favorable termsfor their purchases of products, which will limit Griffons ability to passthrough raw material or other cost increases, or to raise prices for anyreason. Sales on terms less favorable than current terms could have a materialadverse effect on profitability.Unionized employeescould strike or participate in a work stoppage.Griffon employs approximately 5,400 people on a full-time basis,approximately 8% of whom are covered by collective bargaining or similar laboragreements (all in the Telephonics and ATT businesses). If unionized employeesengage in a strike or other work stoppage, or if Griffon is unable to negotiateacceptable extensions of agreements with labor unions, a significant disruptionof operations and increased operating costs could occur. In addition, anyrenegotiation or renewal of labor agreements could result in higher wages orbenefits paid to unionized employees, which could increase operating costs andcould have a material adverse effect on profitability.19Griffon may berequired to record impairment charges for goodwill and indefinite-livedintangible assets.Griffon is required to assess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibleassets annually for impairment or on an interim basis if changes incircumstances or the  occurrence of events suggest impairment exists. Ifimpairment testing indicates that the carrying value of reporting units orindefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds the respective fair value, an impairment charge would berecognized. If goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets were to becomeimpaired, the results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.Trends in the baby diaper market willdirectly impact Griffons business.Recent trends have been for baby diaper manufacturers to specifythinner plastic films for use in their products which reduces the amount ofproduct sold and Plastics revenue; this trend has generally resulted inPlastics incurring costs to redesign and reengineer products to accommodaterequired specification changes. Such decreases, or the inability to meetchanging customer specifications, could result in a material decline inPlastics revenue and profits.Telephonics business depends heavily upongovernment contracts and, therefore, the defense budget.Telephonics sells products to the U.S. government and its agencies bothdirectly and indirectly as a first-tier supplier to prime contractors in thedefense industry such as Boeing, Lockheed Martin, Sikorsky and NorthropGrumman. In the year ended September 30, 2012, U.S. government contracts andsubcontracts accounted for approximately 19% of Griffons consolidated revenue.Contracts involving the U.S. government may include various risks, including:    Termination for convenience by the government; Reduction or modification in the event of changes in the governments requirements or budgetary constraints; Increased or unexpected costs, causing losses or reduced profits under contracts where Telephonics prices are fixed, or determinations that certain costs are not allowable under particular government contracts; The failure or inability of the prime contractor to perform its contract in circumstances where Telephonics is a subcontractor; Failure to observe and comply with government business practice and procurement regulations such that Telephonics could be suspended or barred from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts; The failure of the government to exercise options for additional work provided for in contracts; and The governments right, in certain circumstances, to freely use technology developed under these contracts.All of Telephonics U.S. Government end-user contracts contain atermination for convenience clause, regardless if Telephonics is the primecontractor or the subcontractor. This clause generally entitles Telephonics,upon a termination for convenience, to receive the purchase price for delivereditems, reimbursement of allowable work-in-process costs, and an allowance forprofit. Allowable costs would include the costs to terminate existingagreements with suppliers.The programs in which Telephonics participates may extend for severalyears, but are normally funded on an incremental basis. Decreases in the U.S.defense budget, in particular with respect to programs to which Telephonicssupplies materials, could have a material adverse impact on Telephonicsfinancial conditions, results of operations and cash flows. The U.S. governmentmay not continue to fund programs to which Telephonics development projectsapply. Even if funding is continued, Telephonics may fail to competesuccessfully to obtain funding pursuant to such programs. Reductions to fundingon existing programs or delays in the funding of new opportunities could affectthe timing of revenue recognition, and impact the results of operation.20For 2013, the Budget Control Act calls for additional substantial,mandatory defense spending reductions, known as sequestration, if Congress isunable to  agree on a budget that conforms with the Budget Control Actrequirements. There continues to be much uncertainty regarding howsequestration would be implemented, if it were to go into effect. There are many variables inhow the law could be applied that make it difficult to determine the specificimpacts; however, we expect that sequestration, as currently provided for underthe Budget Control Act, would result in lower revenues, profits and cash flowsfor Telephonics.While members of Congress are discussing various    options to prevent or defer sequestrations automatic spending cuts,    we cannot predict whether these efforts will succeed. Budget decisions made    in this environment could have long-term consequences for Telephonics and    the entire defense industry. Telephonics business could be adversely affected by a negative auditby the U.S. GovernmentAs a government contractor, and a subcontractor to governmentcontractors, Telephonics is subject to audits and investigations by U.S.Government Agencies such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency, other InspectorsGeneral and the Department of Justice. These agencies review a contractorsperformance under its contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicablelaws, regulations and standards. These agencies also review the adequacy of,and a contractors compliance with, its internal control systems and policies,including the contractors management, purchasing, property, estimating,compensation, and accounting and information systems. Any costs found to bemisclassified or improperly allocated to a specific contract will not bereimbursed or must be refunded if already billed and collected. Griffon couldincur significant expenses in complying with audits and subpoenas issued by thegovernment in aid of inquiries and investigations. If an audit or aninvestigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, Telephonics may besubject to civil and criminal penalties and/or administrative sanctions, whichcould include contract termination, forfeiture of profit, suspension ofpayments, fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the U.S.Government. In addition, if allegations of impropriety are made, Telephonicsand Griffon could suffer serious reputational harm.Many of ourcontracts contain performance obligations that require innovative designcapabilities, are technologically complex, or are dependent upon factors notwholly within our control. Failure to meet these obligations could adverselyaffect customer relations, future business opportunities, and our overall profitability.Our Telephonics segment designs, develops and manufactures advanced andinnovative surveillance and communication products for a broad range ofapplications for use in varying environments. As with many of our programs,system specifications, operational requirements and test requirements arechallenging, exacerbated by the need for quick delivery schedules. Technical problems encountered and delaysin the development or delivery of such products could prevent us from meetingcontractual obligations, which could subject us to termination fordefault. Under a termination for default, the company is entitled to negotiatepayment for undelivered work if the Government requests the transfer of titleand delivery of partially completed supplies and materials. Conversely, if theGovernment does not make this request, there is no obligation to reimburse thecompany for its costs incurred. We may also be subject to the repayment ofadvance and progress payments, if any. Additionally, the company may be liableto the Government for any of its excess costs incurred in acquiring suppliesand services similar to those terminated for default, and for other damages.Should any of the foregoing events occur, it could result in a material adverseeffect on our financial position.Griffons companies must continually improveexisting products, design and sell new products and invest in research anddevelopment in order to compete effectively.The markets for Plastics and Telephonics are characterized by rapid technologicalchange, evolving industry standards and continuous improvements in products.Due to constant changes in these markets, future success depends on theirability to develop new technologies, products, processes and productapplications.21Product and technological developments are accomplished both throughinternally-funded R&D projects, as well as through strategic partnershipswith customers. Because it is not generally possible to predict the amount oftime required and costs involved in achieving certain R&D objectives,actual development costs may exceed budgeted amounts and estimated productdevelopment schedules may be extended. Griffons financial condition andresults of operations may be materially and adversely affected if:    Product improvements are not completed on a timely basis; New products are not introduced on a timely basis or do not achieve sufficient market penetration; There are budget overruns or delays in research and development efforts; or New products experience reliability or quality problems.Griffon may be unable to implement itsacquisition growth strategy, which may result in added expenses without acommensurate increase in revenue and income and divert managements attention.Making strategic acquisitions is a significant part of Griffons growthplans. The ability to successfully complete acquisitions depends on identifyingand acquiring, on acceptable terms, companies that either complement or enhancecurrently held businesses or expand Griffon into new profitable businesses.Additionally, Griffon must properly integrate acquired businesses in order tomaximize profitability. The competition for acquisition candidates is intenseand Griffon cannot assure that it will successfully identify acquisitioncandidates and complete acquisitions at reasonable purchase prices, in a timelymanner or at all. Further, there is a risk that acquisitions will not beproperly integrated into Griffons existing structure. In implementing anacquisition growth strategy, the following may be encountered:    Costs associated with incomplete or poorly implemented acquisitions; Expenses, delays and difficulties of integrating acquired companies into Griffons existing organization; Dilution of the interest of existing stockholders; or Diversion of managements attention.An unsuccessful implementation of Griffons acquisition growth strategycould have an adverse impact on Griffons results of operations, cash flows andfinancial condition.The loss of certain key officers or employees could adversely affectGriffons business. The success of Griffon is materially dependent upon the continuedservices of certain key officers and employees. The loss of such key personnelcould have a material adverse effect on Griffons operating results orfinancial condition.Griffon is exposed to a variety of risksrelating to non-U.S. sales and operations, including non-U.S. economic andpolitical conditions and fluctuations in exchange rates.Griffon and its companies own properties and conduct operations inEurope, Canada, Australia, Brazil, Mexico, China and Turkey. Sales of productsthrough non-U.S. subsidiaries accounted for approximately 25% of consolidatedrevenue for the year ended September 30, 2012. These sales could be adverselyaffected by changes in political and economic conditions, trade protectionmeasures, differing intellectual property rights laws and changes in regulatoryrequirements that restrict the sales of products or increase costs. Enforcementof existing laws in foreign jurisdictions can be uncertain, and the lack of asophisticated body of laws can create various uncertainties, including withrespect to customer and supplier contracts. Currency fluctuations between theU.S. dollar and the currencies in the non-U.S. regions in which Griffon doesbusiness may also have an impact on future reported financial results. 22Griffon may not be able to protect itsproprietary rights.Griffon relies on a combination of patent, copyright and trademark laws,trade secrets, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements and othercontractual provisions to protect proprietary rights. Such measures do notprovide absolute protection and Griffon cannot give assurance that measures forprotecting these proprietary rights are and will be adequate, or thatcompetitors will not independently develop similar technologies.Griffon may inadvertently infringe on, or may be accused of infringingon, proprietary rights held by another party.Griffon is regularly improving its technology and employing existingtechnologies in new ways. Though Griffon takes reasonable precautions to ensureit does not infringe on the rights of others, it is possible that Griffon mayinadvertently infringe on, or may be accused of infringing on, proprietaryrights held by others. If Griffon is found to have infringed on the proprietyrights held by others, any related litigation or settlement relating to suchinfringement may have a material effect on Griffons financial statements andfinancial condition.Griffon is exposed to product liabilityclaims.Griffon may be the subject of product liability claims relating to theperformance of its products or the performance of a product in which itsproducts were a component part. There can be no assurance that future productliability claims will not be brought against Griffon, either by an injuredcustomer of an end product manufacturer who used one of the products as acomponent or by a direct purchaser. Moreover, no assurance can be given that indemnificationfrom customers or coverage under insurance policies will be adequate to coverfuture product liability claims against Griffon. In addition, product liabilityinsurance can be expensive, difficult to maintain and may be unobtainable inthe future on acceptable terms. The amount and scope of any insurance coveragemay be inadequate if a product liability claim is successfully asserted.Furthermore, if any significant claims are made, the business and the relatedfinancial condition of Griffon may be adversely affected by negative publicity.Griffon has been, and may in the future be,subject to claims and liabilities under environmental laws and regulations.Griffons operations and assets are subject to environmental laws andregulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment, thehandling and disposal of wastes, including solid and hazardous wastes, orotherwise relating to health, safety and protection of the environment, invarious jurisdictions in which it operates. Griffon does not expect to make anyexpenditure with respect to ongoing compliance with or remediation under theseenvironmental laws and regulations that would have a material adverse effect onits business, operating results or financial condition. However, the applicablerequirements under environmental laws and regulations may change at any time.Griffon can incur environmental costs related to sites that are nolonger owned or operated, as well as third-party sites to which hazardousmaterials are sent. It cannot be assured that material expenditures orliabilities will not be incurred in connection with such claims. See theCommitment and Contingencies footnote in the Notes to Consolidated FinancialStatements for further information on environmental contingencies. Based onfacts presently known, the outcome of current environmental matters are notexpected to have a material adverse effect on Griffons results of operationsand financial condition. However, presently unknown environmental conditions,changes in environmental laws and regulations or other unanticipated events maygive rise to claims that may involve material expenditures or liabilities.23Changes in income tax laws and regulations orexposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affectprofitability.Griffon is subject to Federal, state and local income taxes in the U.S.and in various taxing jurisdictions outside the U.S. Tax provisions andliabilities are subject to the allocation of income among various U.S. andinternational tax jurisdictions. Griffons effective tax rate could beadversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries withdiffering statutory tax rates, changes in any valuation allowance for deferredtax assets or the amendment or enactment of tax laws. The amount of incometaxes paid is subject to audits by U.S. Federal, state and local taxauthorities, as well as tax authorities in the taxing jurisdictions outside theU.S. If such audits result in assessments different from recorded income taxliabilities, Griffons future financial results may include unfavorableadjustments to its income tax provision.Compliance with restrictions and covenants inGriffons debt agreements may limit its ability to take corporate actions andharm its business.The senior secured credit agreement entered into by, and the terms ofthe senior notes issued by, Griffon each contain covenants that restrict theability of Griffon and its subsidiaries to, among other things, incuradditional debt, pay dividends, incur liens and make investments, acquisitions,dispositions, restricted payments and capital expenditures. Under the creditagreement, Griffon is also required to comply with specific financial ratiosand tests. Griffon may not be able to comply in the future with these covenantsor restrictions as a result of events beyond its control, such as prevailingeconomic, financial and industry conditions or a change in control of Griffon.If Griffon defaults in maintaining compliance with the covenants and restrictionsin its credit agreement or the senior notes, its lenders could declare all ofthe principal and interest amounts outstanding due and payable and, in the caseof the credit agreement, terminate their commitments to extend credit toGriffon in the future. If Griffon or its subsidiaries are unable to securecredit in the future, business could be harmed.Reported earnings per share may be morevolatile because of the conversion contingency provision of the notes.The outstanding convertible notes are convertible when a market pricecondition is satisfied and also upon the occurrence of other circumstances asmore fully described in the Notes Payable, Capitalized Leases and Long-TermDebt footnote in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Upon conversion,at Griffons discretion, note holders will receive $1,000 in cash for each$1,000 principal amount of notes presented for conversion or value in Griffonscommon stock, and Griffon common stock for the value above the principal amountof the notes. The potential shares of Griffon common stock issuable for valueabove the principal value of the notes are considered in the calculation ofdiluted earnings per share and volatility in Griffons stock price could causethese notes to be dilutive in one quarter and not in a subsequent quarter,increasing the volatility of fully diluted earnings per share.Griffon may be unable to raise additionalfinancing if neededGriffon may need to raise additionalfinancing in the future in order to implement its business plan, refinancedebt, or to acquire new or complimentary businesses or assets. Any requiredadditional financing may be unavailable, or only available at unfavorableterms, due to uncertainties in the credit markets. If Griffon raises additionalfunds by issuing equity securities, current holders of its common stock mayexperience significant ownership interest dilution and the new securities mayhave rights senior to the rights associated with current outstanding commonstock.24Griffons indebtedness and interest expensecould limit cash flow and adversely affect operations and Griffons ability tomake full payment on outstanding debt.Griffonsindebtedness poses potential risks such as:    A substantial portion of cash flows from operations could be used to pay principal and interest on debt, thereby reducing the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, product development and other general corporate purposes; Insufficient cash flows from operations may force Griffon to sell assets, or seek additional capital, which Griffon may not be able to accomplish on favorable terms, if at all; and The level of indebtedness may make Griffon more vulnerable to economic or industry downturns.Griffon has the ability to issue additionalequity securities, which would lead to dilution of issued and outstandingcommon stock.The issuance of additional equity securities or securities convertibleinto equity securities would result in dilution to existing stockholders equityinterests. Griffon is authorized to issue, without stockholder vote orapproval, 3,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series, and hasthe ability to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of anysuch series. Any such series of preferred stock could contain dividend rights,conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices,liquidation preferences or other rights superior to the rights of holders ofGriffons common stock. There is no present intention of issuing any suchpreferred stock, but Griffon reserves the right to do so in the future. Inaddition, Griffon is authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, up to85,000,000 shares of common stock, of which 60,888,522 shares, net of treasury shares,were outstanding as of September 30, 2012. Additionally, Griffon is authorizedto issue, without stockholder approval, securities convertible into eithershares of common stock or preferred stock"
6,GFF,GRIFFON CORP,2011-11-18,"Risk Factors
Griffons business,financial condition, operating results and cash flows can be impacted by anumber of factors which could cause Griffons actual results to vary materiallyfrom recent or anticipated future results. The risk factors discussed in thissection should be carefully considered with all of the information in thisAnnual Report on Form 10-K. These risk factors should not be considered the onlyrisk factors facing Griffon. Additional risks and uncertainties not presentlyknown or that are currently deemed immaterial may also materially impactGriffons business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows inthe future.In general, Griffon issubject to the same general risks and uncertainties that impact other diversemanufacturing companies including, but not limited to, general economic,industry and/or market conditions and growth rates; impact of natural disastersand their effect on global markets; continued events in the Middle East andpossible future terrorist threats and their effect on the worldwide economy;and changes in laws or accounting rules. Griffon has identified the followingspecific risks and uncertainties that it believes has the potential tomaterially affect its business and financial condition.Currentworldwide economic uncertainty and market volatility could adversely affectGriffons businesses. The current worldwideeconomic uncertainty, market volatility and credit crisis will continue to havean adverse effect on Griffon during 2012, particularly in HBP, which issubstantially linked to the U.S. housing market and the U.S. economy, ingeneral. Also, purchases of ATT products are discretionary for consumers andconsumers are generally more willing to purchase products during periods inwhich favorable macroeconomic conditions prevail. Additionally, the currentcondition of the credit markets could impact Griffons ability to refinanceexpiring debt, obtain additional credit for investments in current businessesor for acquisitions, with favorable terms, or there may be no financingavailable. Griffon is also exposed to basic economic risks including a decreasein the demand for the products and services offered or a higher risk of defaulton its receivables. Adversetrends in the housing sector and in general economic conditions will directlyimpact Griffons business.HBPs business isinfluenced by market conditions for new home construction and renovation ofexisting homes. For the year ended September 30, 2011, approximately 46% ofGriffons consolidated revenue was derived from the HBP segment, which isheavily dependent on new home construction and renovation of existing homes.The strength of the U.S. economy, the age of existing home stock, job growth,interest rates, consumer confidence and the availability of consumer credit, aswell as demographic factors such as the migration into the United States andmigration of the population within the United States also have an effect onHBP. In that respect, the significant downturn in the housing market has had anadverse effect on the operating results of HBP and this effect is likely tocontinue in 2012, particularly to its CBP business.Griffonoperates in highly competitive industries and may be unable to competeeffectively.Griffons operatingcompanies face intense competition in each of the markets served. There are anumber of competitors, some of which are larger and have greater resources thanGriffons operating companies. Griffon competes primarily on the basis ofcompetitive prices, technical expertise, product differentiation, and qualityof products and services. There can be no assurance that Griffon will notencounter increased competition in the future, which could have a materialadverse effect on Griffons financial results.17Theloss of large customers can harm financial results.A small number ofcustomers account for, and are expected to continue to account for, asubstantial portion of consolidated revenue. Approximately 14% of consolidatedrevenue and 49% of the Plastics segment revenue for the year ended September30, 2011 was generated from P&G, the largest customer in the Plasticssegment. Home Depot, Lowes and Menards are significant customers of HBP withHome Depot accounting for approximately 12% of consolidated revenue and 25% ofthe HBP segment revenue for the year ended September 30, 2011. The U.S.Government and its agencies, Lockheed Martin Corporation and the Boeing Company,are significant customers of Telephonics. Future operating results willcontinue to substantially depend on the success of Griffons largest customers,as well as Griffons relationship with them. Orders from these customers aresubject to fluctuation and may be reduced materially due to changes in thesecustomers needs. Any reduction or delay in sales of products to one or more ofthese customers could significantly reduce Griffons revenue. Griffonsoperating results will also depend on successfully developing relationshipswith additional key customers. Griffon cannot assure that Griffons largestcustomers will be retained or that additional key customers will be recruited.Also, HBP extends credit to its customers, which exposes it to credit risk. Theirlargest customer accounted for approximately 24% and 10% of HBPs and Griffonsnet accounts receivable as of September 30, 2011, respectively. If thiscustomer were to become insolvent or otherwise unable to pay its debts, thefinancial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the HBP segmentwould be adversely affected.Reliance on third party suppliers and manufacturers mayimpair ability to meet ATTs customer demands.ATT relies on a limitednumber of domestic and foreign companies to supply components and manufacturecertain of its products. The percentage of ATTs products sourced, based onrevenue, approximated 23% in 2011. Reliance on third party suppliers andmanufacturers may reduce control over the timing of deliveries and quality ofATTs products. Reduced product quality or failure to deliver products quicklymay jeopardize relationships with certain of ATTs key customers. In addition,reliance on third party suppliers or manufacturers may result in failure tomeet ATTs customer demands. Continued turbulence in the worldwide economy mayaffect the liquidity and financial condition of ATTs suppliers. Should any ofthese parties fail to manufacture sufficient supply, go out of business ordiscontinue a particular component, alternative suppliers may not be found in atimely manner, if at all. Such events could impact ATTs ability to fillorders, which would have a material adverse effect on customer relationships.If Griffon is unable to obtain raw materials for products atfavorable prices it could adversely impact operating performance.HBPs and Plasticssuppliers primarily provide resin, wood and steel. Assurance cannot be providedthat these segments may not experience shortages of raw materials or componentsfor products or be forced to seek alternative sources of supply. If temporaryshortages due to disruptions in supply caused by weather, transportation,production delays or other factors require raw materials to be secured fromsources other than current suppliers, the terms may not be as favorable ascurrent terms or material may not be available at all. In recent years, HBP andPlastics have experienced price increases in steel and plastic resins.While most key rawmaterials used in Griffons businesses are generally available from numeroussources, raw materials are subject to price fluctuations. Because raw materialsin the aggregate constitute a significant component of the cost of goods sold,price fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on Griffons results ofoperations. Griffons ability to pass raw material price increases to customersis limited due to supply arrangements and competitive pricing pressure, andthere is generally a time lag between increased raw material costs andimplementation of corresponding price increases for Griffons products. Inparticular, sharp increases in raw material prices are more difficult to passthrough to customers and may negatively affect short-term financialperformance.18ATT is subject to risks associated with sourcing from Asia.A substantial amount ofATTs finished goods sourcing is done through supply agreements with Chinabased vendors. China does not have a well-developed, consolidated body of lawsgoverning agreements with international customers. Enforcement of existing lawsor contracts based on existing law may be uncertain and sporadic, and it may bedifficult to obtain swift and equitable enforcement or to obtain enforcement ofa judgment by a court of another jurisdiction. The relative inexperience of Chinasjudiciary in many cases creates additional uncertainty as to the outcome of anylitigation. In addition, interpretation of statutes and regulations may besubject to government policies reflecting domestic political changes. Productsentering from China may be subject to import quotas, import duties and otherrestrictions. Any inability to import these products into the U.S. and anytariffs that may be levied with respect to these products may have a materialadverse result on ATTs business and results of operations, financial positionand cash flows.Griffonsbusinesses are subject to seasonal variations and the impact of uncertainweather patterns.Prior to the acquisitionof ATT, Griffons revenue and income had been lowest in our second quarterending March 31 and highest in our fourth quarter ending September 30,primarily due to the seasonality of CBPs business, which is driven byresidential renovation and construction, and which is generally at reducedlevels during the winter months and at its highest levels during warm weather.Because a high percentage of CBPs manufacturing overhead and operatingexpenses are relatively fixed throughout the year, operating margins havehistorically been lower in those quarters with lower revenue. With the inclusion ofATTs operating results, which started on October 1, 2010, our first and fourthquarters are expected to be Griffons lower revenue and income quarters. ATTslawn and garden products are used primarily in the spring and summer; in 2011, 59%of ATTs sales occurred during the second and third fiscal quarters.Demand for lawn andgarden products is influenced by weather, particularly weekend weather duringthe peak gardening season. ATTs sales volumes could be adversely affected bycertain weather patterns such as unseasonably cool or warm temperatures,hurricanes, water shortages or floods. In addition, lack of snow or lower thanaverage snowfall during the winter season may also result in reduced sales ofcertain ATT products, such as snow shovels and other snow tools. As a result,ATTs results of operations, financial results and cash flows could beadversely impacted.Further consolidation in the retail industry may adverselyaffect profitability.Home centers and massmerchandisers have consolidated and increased in scale. If this trendcontinues, customers will likely seek more favorable terms for their purchasesof products, which will limit Griffons ability to pass through raw material orother cost increases, or to raise prices for any reason. Sales on terms lessfavorable than current terms could have a material adverse effect onprofitability.Unionized employees could strike or participate in a workstoppage.Griffon employsapproximately 5,900 people on a full-time basis, approximately 9% of whom arecovered by collective bargaining or similar labor agreements (all in theTelephonics and ATT businesses). If unionized employees engage in a strike orother work stoppage, or if Griffon is unable to negotiate acceptable extensionsof agreements with labor unions, a significant disruption of operations andincreased operating costs could occur. In addition, any renegotiation orrenewal of labor agreements could result in higher wages or benefits paid tounionized employees, which could increase operating costs and could have amaterial adverse effect on profitability.19Griffon may be required to record impairment charges forgoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.Griffon is required toassess goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually for impairmentor on an interim basis if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of eventssuggest impairment exists. If impairment testing indicates that the carryingvalue of reporting units or indefinite-lived intangible assets exceeds therespective fair value, an impairment charge would be recognized. If goodwill orindefinite-lived intangible assets were to become impaired, the results ofoperations could be materially and adversely affected.Trendsin the baby diaper market will directly impact Griffons business.Recent trends have beenfor baby diaper manufacturers to specify thinner plastic films for use in theirproducts which reduces the amount of product sold and Plastics revenue; thistrend has generally resulted in Plastics incurring costs to redesign andreengineer products to accommodate required specification changes. Suchdecreases, or the inability to meet changing customer specifications, couldresult in a material decline in Plastics revenue and profits.Telephonicsbusiness depends heavily upon government contracts and, therefore, the defensebudget.Telephonics sellsproducts to the U.S. government and its agencies both directly and indirectlyas a first-tier supplier to prime contractors in the defense industry such asBoeing, Lockheed Martin, Sikorsky and Northrop Grumman. In the year endedSeptember 30, 2011, U.S. government contracts and subcontracts accounted forapproximately 19% of Griffons consolidated revenue. Contracts involving theU.S. government may include various risks, including:    Termination for convenience by the government; Reduction or modification in the event of changes in the governments requirements or budgetary constraints; Increased or unexpected costs, causing losses or reduced profits under contracts where Telephonics prices are fixed, or determinations that certain costs are not allowable under particular government contracts; The failure or inability of the prime contractor to perform its contract in circumstances where Telephonics is a subcontractor; Failure to observe and comply with government business practice and procurement regulations such that Telephonics could be suspended or barred from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts; The failure of the government to exercise options for additional work provided for in contracts; and The governments right, in certain circumstances, to freely use technology developed under these contracts.All of Telephonics U.S.Government end-user contracts contain a termination for convenience clause,regardless if Telephonics is the prime contractor or the subcontractor. Thisclause generally entitles Telephonics, upon a termination for convenience, toreceive the purchase price for delivered items, reimbursement of allowablework-in-process costs, and an allowance for profit. Allowable costs wouldinclude the costs to terminate existing agreements with suppliers.The programs in whichTelephonics participates may extend for several years, but are normally fundedon an incremental basis. Decreases in the U.S. defense budget, in particularwith respect to programs to which Telephonics supplies materials, could have amaterial adverse impact on Telephonics financial conditions, results of operationsand cash flows. The U.S. government may not continue to fund programs to whichTelephonics development projects apply. Even if funding is continued,Telephonics may fail to compete successfully to obtain funding pursuant to suchprograms.20If the U.S. governmentdoes not complete the budget process before the end of its fiscal year, thengovernment procurement operations are typically funded through a continuingresolution that enables agencies of the U.S. Government to continue to operate,but does not authorize new spending initiatives. When the U.S. Governmentoperates under a continuing resolution, delays can occur in the procurement ofproducts and services. Delays in procurement awards may affect the timing ofrevenue recognition between fiscal periods.Telephonicsbusiness could be adversely affected by a negative audit by the U.S. GovernmentAs a governmentcontractor, and a subcontractor to government contractors, Telephonics issubject to audits and investigations by U.S. Government Agencies such as theDefense Contract Audit Agency, other Inspectors General and the Department ofJustice. These agencies review a contractors performance under its contracts,cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards.These agencies also review the adequacy of, and a contractors compliance with,its internal control systems and policies, including the contractorsmanagement, purchasing, property, estimating, compensation, and accounting andinformation systems. Any costs found to be misclassified or improperlyallocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed or must be refunded ifalready billed and collected. Griffon could incur significant expenses incomplying with audits and subpoenas issued by the government in aid ofinquiries and investigations. If an audit or an investigation uncovers improperor illegal activities, Telephonics may be subject to civil and criminalpenalties and/or administrative sanctions, which could include contracttermination, forfeiture of profit, suspension of payments, fines and suspensionor prohibition from doing business with the U.S. Government. In addition, ifallegations of impropriety are made, Telephonics and Griffon could sufferserious reputational harm.Many of our contracts contain performance obligations thatrequire innovative design capabilities, are technologically complex, or aredependent upon factors not wholly within our control. Failure to meet theseobligations could adversely affect customer relations, future businessopportunities, and our overall profitability.Our Telephonics segmentdesigns, develops and manufactures advanced and innovative surveillance andcommunication products for a broad range of applications for use in varyingenvironments. As with many of our programs, the system specifications,operational requirements and test requirements are challenging, exacerbated bythe need for quick delivery schedules. Technicalproblems encountered and delays in the development or delivery of such productscould prevent us from meeting contractual obligations, which could subjectus to termination for default. Under a termination for default, the company isentitled to negotiate payment for undelivered work if the Government requeststhe transfer of title and delivery of partially completed supplies andmaterials. Conversely, if the Government does not make this request, there isno obligation to reimburse the company for its costs incurred. We may also besubject to the repayment of advance and progress payments, if any.Additionally, the company may be liable to the Government for any of its excesscosts incurred in acquiring supplies and services similar to those terminatedfor default, and for other damages. Should any of the foregoing events occur,it could result in a material adverse effect on our financial position.Griffonscompanies must continually improve existing products, design and sell newproducts and invest in research and development in order to competeeffectively.The markets for Plasticsand Telephonics are characterized by rapid technological change, evolvingindustry standards and continuous improvements in products. Due to constantchanges in these markets, future success depends on their ability to developnew technologies, products, processes and product applications.21Product and technologicaldevelopments are accomplished both through internally-funded R&D projects,as well as through strategic partnerships with customers. Because it is notgenerally possible to predict the amount of time required and costs involved inachieving certain R&D objectives, actual development costs may exceedbudgeted amounts and estimated product development schedules may be extended.Griffons financial condition and results of operations may be materially andadversely affected if:    Product improvements are not completed on a timely basis; New products are not introduced on a timely basis or do not achieve sufficient market penetration; There are budget overruns or delays in research and development efforts; or New products experience reliability or quality problems.Griffonmay be unable to implement its acquisition growth strategy, which may result inadded expenses without a commensurate increase in revenue and income and divertmanagements attention.Making strategicacquisitions is a significant part of Griffons growth plans. The ability tosuccessfully complete acquisitions depends on identifying and acquiring, onacceptable terms, companies that either complement or enhance currently heldbusinesses or expand Griffon into new profitable businesses. Additionally,Griffon must properly integrate acquired businesses in order to maximizeprofitability. The competition for acquisition candidates is intense andGriffon cannot assure that it will successfully identify acquisition candidatesand complete acquisitions at reasonable purchase prices, in a timely manner orat all. Further, there is a risk that acquisitions will not be properlyintegrated into Griffons existing structure. In implementing an acquisitiongrowth strategy, the following may be encountered:    Costs associated with incomplete or poorly implemented acquisitions; Expenses, delays and difficulties of integrating acquired companies into Griffons existing organization; Dilution of the interest of existing stockholders; or Diversion of managements attention.An unsuccessfulimplementation of Griffons acquisition growth strategy could have an adverseimpact on Griffons results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.Theloss of certain key officers or employees could adversely affect Griffonsbusiness.The success of Griffon ismaterially dependent upon the continued services of certain key officers andemployees. The loss of such key personnel could have a material adverse effecton Griffons operating results or financial condition.Griffonis exposed to a variety of risks relating to non-U.S. sales and operations,including non-U.S. economic and political conditions and fluctuations inexchange rates.Griffon and its companiesown properties and conduct operations in Europe, Canada, Australia, Brazil,Mexico, China and Turkey. Sales of products through non-U.S. subsidiariesaccounted for approximately 25% of consolidated revenue for the year endedSeptember 30, 2011. These sales could be adversely affected by changes inpolitical and economic conditions, trade protection measures, differingintellectual property rights laws and changes in regulatory requirements thatrestrict the sales of products or increase costs. Currency fluctuations betweenthe U.S. dollar and the currencies in the non-U.S. regions in which Griffondoes business may also have an impact on future reported financial results. Griffonmay not be able to protect its proprietary rights.Griffon relies on acombination of patent, copyright and trademark laws, trade secrets,confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements and other contractual provisionsto protect proprietary rights. Such measures do not provide absoluteprotection and Griffon cannot give assurance that measures for protecting theseproprietary rights are and will be adequate, or that competitors will notindependently develop similar technologies.22Griffon may inadvertently infringeon, or may be accused of infringing on, proprietary rights held by anotherparty.Griffon is regularlyimproving its technology and employing existing technologies in new ways.Though Griffon takes reasonable precautions to ensure it does not infringe onthe rights of others, it is possible that Griffon may inadvertently infringeon, or may be accused of infringing on, proprietary rights held by others. IfGriffon is found to have infringed on the propriety rights held by others, anyrelated litigation or settlement relating to such infringement may have amaterial effect on Griffons financial statements and financial condition.Griffonis exposed to product liability claims.Griffon may be thesubject of product liability claims relating to the performance of its productsor the performance of a product in which its products were a component part.There can be no assurance that future product liability claims will not bebrought against Griffon, either by an injured customer of an end productmanufacturer who used one of the products as a component or by a directpurchaser. Moreover, no assurance can be given that indemnification fromcustomers or coverage under insurance policies will be adequate to cover futureproduct liability claims against Griffon. In addition, product liability insurancecan be expensive, difficult to maintain and may be unobtainable in the futureon acceptable terms. The amount and scope of any insurance coverage may beinadequate if a product liability claim is successfully asserted. Furthermore,if any significant claims are made, the business and the related financialcondition of Griffon may be adversely affected by negative publicity.Griffonhas been, and may in the future be, subject to claims and liabilities underenvironmental laws and regulations.Griffons operations andassets are subject to environmental laws and regulations pertaining to thedischarge of materials into the environment, the handling and disposal ofwastes, including solid and hazardous wastes, or otherwise relating to health,safety and protection of the environment, in various jurisdictions in which itoperates. Griffon does not expect to make any expenditure with respect toongoing compliance with or remediation under these environmental laws andregulations that would have a material adverse effect on its business,operating results or financial condition. However, the applicable requirementsunder environmental laws and regulations may change at any time.Griffon can incurenvironmental costs related to sites that are no longer owned or operated, aswell as third-party sites to which hazardous materials are sent. It cannot beassured that material expenditures or liabilities will not be incurred inconnection with such claims. See the Commitment and Contingencies footnote inthe Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information onenvironmental contingencies. Based on facts presently known, the outcome ofcurrent environmental matters are not expected to have a material adverseeffect on Griffons results of operations and financial condition. However,presently unknown environmental conditions, changes in environmental laws andregulations or other unanticipated events may give rise to claims that mayinvolve material expenditures or liabilities.Changesin income tax laws and regulations or exposure to additional income taxliabilities could adversely affect profitability.Griffon is subject toFederal, state and local income taxes in the U.S. and in various taxingjurisdictions outside the U.S. Tax provisions and liabilities are subject tothe allocation of income among various U.S. and international taxjurisdictions. Griffons effective tax rate could be adversely affected bychanges in23the mix of earnings incountries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in any valuationallowance for deferred tax assets or the amendment or enactment of tax laws.The amount of income taxes paid is subject to audits by U.S. Federal, state andlocal tax authorities, as well as tax authorities in the taxing jurisdictionsoutside the U.S. If such audits result in assessments different from recordedincome tax liabilities, Griffons future financial results may includeunfavorable adjustments to its income tax provision.Compliancewith restrictions and covenants in Griffons debt agreements may limit itsability to take corporate actions and harm its business.The senior secured creditagreement entered into by, and the terms of the senior notes issued by, Griffoneach contain covenants that restrict the ability of Griffon and its subsidiariesto, among other things, incur additional debt, pay dividends, incur liens andmake investments, acquisitions, dispositions, restricted payments and capitalexpenditures. Under the credit agreement, Griffon is also required to complywith specific financial ratios and tests. Griffon may not be able to comply inthe future with these covenants or restrictions as a result of events beyondits control, such as prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions ora change in control of Griffon. If Griffon defaults in maintaining compliancewith the covenants and restrictions in its credit agreement or the seniornotes, its lenders could declare all of the principal and interest amountsoutstanding due and payable and, in the case of the credit agreement, terminatetheir commitments to extend credit to Griffon in the future. If Griffon or itssubsidiaries are unable to secure credit in the future, business could beharmed.Reportedearnings per share may be more volatile because of the conversion contingencyprovision of the notes.The outstandingconvertible notes are convertible when a market price condition is satisfiedand also upon the occurrence of other circumstances as more fully described inthe Notes Payable, Capitalized Leases and Long-Term Debt footnote in the Notesto Consolidated Financial Statements. Upon conversion, at Griffons discretion,note holders will receive $1,000 in cash for each $1,000 principal amount ofnotes presented for conversion or value in Griffons common stock, and Griffoncommon stock for the value above the principal amount of the notes. Thepotential shares of Griffon common stock issuable for value above the principalvalue of the notes are considered in the calculation of diluted earnings pershare and volatility in Griffons stock price could cause these notes to bedilutive in one quarter and not in a subsequent quarter, increasing thevolatility of fully diluted earnings per share.Griffonmay be unable to raise additional financing if neededGriffonmay need to raise additional financing in the future in order to implement itsbusiness plan, refinance debt, or to acquire new or complimentary businesses orassets. Any required additional financing may be unavailable, or only availableat unfavorable terms, due to uncertainties in the credit markets. If Griffonraises additional funds by issuing equity securities, current holders of itscommon stock may experience significant ownership interest dilution and the newsecurities may have rights senior to the rights associated with currentoutstanding common stock.Griffonsindebtedness and interest expense could limit cash flow and adversely affectoperations and Griffons ability to make full payment on outstanding debt.Griffons indebtednessposes potential risks such as:    A substantial portion of cash flows from operations could be used to pay principal and interest on debt, thereby reducing the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, product development and other general corporate purposes;24    Insufficient cash flows from operations may force Griffon to sell assets, or seek additional capital, which Griffon may not be able to accomplish on favorable terms, if at all; and The level of indebtedness may make Griffon more vulnerable to economic or industry downturns.Griffonhas the ability to issue additional equity securities, which would lead todilution of issued and outstanding common stock.The issuance ofadditional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securitieswould result in dilution to existing stockholders equity interests. Griffon isauthorized to issue, without stockholder vote or approval, 3,000,000 shares ofpreferred stock in one or more series, and has the ability to fix the rights,preferences, privileges and restrictions of any such series. Any such series ofpreferred stock could contain dividend rights, conversion rights, votingrights, terms of redemption, redemption prices, liquidation preferences orother rights superior to the rights of holders of Griffons common stock. Thereis no present intention of issuing any such preferred stock, but Griffonreserves the right to do so in the future. In addition, Griffon is authorizedto issue, without stockholder approval, up to 85,000,000 shares of commonstock, of which approximately 61,750,863 shares, net of treasury shares, wereoutstanding as of September 30, 2011. Additionally, Griffon is authorized toissue, without stockholder approval, securities convertible into either sharesof common stock or preferred stock.  "
10,GFF,GRIFFON CORP,2007-11-29,"    Risk Factors
          You should carefully consider the risks described below, as well as the other information appearing in this document. If any of the following risks actuallyoccur, they could materially adversely affect the business, financial condition, operating results or prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the company.Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known or that are currently deemed immaterial may also impair the business, financial condition, operating results and prospects. Trends in the housing sector and in general economic conditions will directly impact the business.          The businesses in the garage door and the installation industries are influenced by market conditions for new home construction and renovation of existing homes.For the year ended September 30, 2007, approximately 46% of the total net sales were related to new home construction and renovation of existing homes. Trends in the housing sector directlyaffect financial performance. Accordingly, the strength of the U.S. economy, the age of existing home stock, job growth, interest rates, consumer confidence and the availability of consumer credit, aswell as demographic factors such as the migration into the United States and migration of the population within the United States have an effect on business. In that respect, the recent downturn inthe housing market has had an adverse effect on the operating results of our garage door and installation services segments. The company continues to be concerned about trends in market conditions andthe outlook for 2008. The Company operates in highly competitive industries and may be unable to compete effectively.          The Company faces intensive competition in each of our markets. It has a number of competitors, some of which are larger and have greater resources. The Companycompetes primarily on the basis of competitive prices, technical expertise, product differentiation, and quality of products and services. In addition, there can be no assurance that the Company willnot encounter increased competition in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on the business. If the Company were to lose any of its largest customers, the results of operations could be significantly harmed.          A small number of customers has accounted for a substantial portion of historical net sales, and the Company expects that a limited number of customers willcontinue to represent a substantial portion of net sales for the foreseeable future. Approximately 13% of our total sales and 54% of our specialty plastic films sales for the fiscal year endedSeptember 30, 2007 were made to Procter & Gamble, which is the largest customer in the specialty plastic films segment. The Home Depot, Inc. and Menards, Inc. aresignificant customers of the garage doors segment and Syracuse Research Corporation, Lockheed Martin Corporation and the Boeing Company are significant customers of the electronic information andcommunication systems segment. The future operating results will continue to substantially depend on the success of the largest customers and our relationships with them. Orders from these customersare subject to fluctuation, and may be reduced materially. Any reduction or delay in sales of products to one or more of these customers could significantly harm the business. The operating resultswill also depend on the Company's ability to successfully develop relationships with additional key customers. The Company cannot assure you that it will retain its largest customers or that it willbe able to recruit additional key customers. Increases in raw material costs could adversely impact the financial condition and operating results.          The Company purchases raw materials from various suppliers. While all raw materials are available from numerous sources, commodity raw materials are subject tofluctuations in price. Because raw materials in the aggregate constitute significant components of the cost of goods sold, such fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on results ofoperations. In recent years, there have been price increases in plastic resins and steel, which are the basic raw materials used in the manufacture of 12 specialtyplastic films and garage door products, respectively. The Company's ability to pass on to customers increases in raw material prices is limited due to customer supply arrangements andcompetitive pricing pressure, and there is generally a time lag between increased costs and implementation of related price increases. The Company has not always been able to increase its prices tofully recoup its increased costs. In addition, sharp increases in raw material prices are more difficult to pass through to customers in a short period of time and may negatively affectshort-term financial performance. Trends in the baby diaper market will directly impact the business.          Recent trends have been for baby diaper manufacturers to specify thinner plastic films for use in their products. This trend has generally resulted in SpecialtyPlastic Films incurring costs to redesign and reengineer its own products to accommodate the specification change and has also had the effect ofreducing revenue due to lower plastic film content in products sold. Such decreases, or the failure of the company to meet changing customer specifications, could result in a decline in revenue andprofits that may have a material adverse effect on the business, operating results, financial condition and prospects. The electronic information and communication systems business depends heavily upon government contracts.          The electronic information and communication systems business sells products to the U.S. government primarily as a subcontractor. The Company is generally a firsttier supplier to prime contractors in the defense industry such as Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007, U.S. government contracts andsubcontracts accounted for approximately 23% of sales. Contracts involving the U.S. government may include various risks, including: terminationby the government;reductionor modification in the event of changes in the government's requirements or budgetary constraints;increasedor unexpected costs causing losses or reduced profits under contracts where our prices are fixed, or unallowable costs under contracts where the governmentreimburses us for costs and pays an additional premium;thefailure or inability of the prime contractor to perform its contract in circumstances where the Company is a subcontractor;thefailure of the company to observe and comply with government business practice and procurement regulations such that the company could be suspended or barred frombidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts;thefailure of the government to exercise options for additional work provided for in the contracts; andthegovernment's right in certain circumstances to freely use technology developed under these contracts.         Theprograms in which the Company participates may extend for several years, but are normally funded on an annual basis. The U.S. government may not continue to fund programs to whichdevelopment projects apply. Even if funding is continued, the Company may fail to compete successfully to obtain funding pursuant to such programs. 13 The Company must continually improve existing products, design and sell new products and manage the costs of research and development in order to compete effectively.          The markets for specialty plastic films and electronic information and communication systems businesses are characterized by rapid technological change, evolvingindustry standards and continuous improvements in products. Due to constant changes in these markets, future success depends on the Company's ability to develop new technologies, products, processesand product applications.         TheCompany develops technologies and products through internally funded research and development and strategic partnerships with its customers. Because it is generally not possible topredict the amount of time required and the costs involved in achieving certain research and development objectives, actual development costs may exceed budgeted amounts and estimated productdevelopment schedules may be extended. The business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected if: theCompany is unable to improve our existing products on a timely basis;newproducts are not introduced on a timely basis or do not achieve sufficient market penetration;theCompany incurs budget overruns or delays in research and development efforts; ornewproducts experience reliability or quality problems. The loss of certain key officers or employees could adversely affect the Company.          The success of the business is materially dependent upon the continued services of certain of key officers and employees. The loss of such key personnel couldhave a material adverse effect on the business, operating results or financial condition. The businesses are subject to seasonal variations.          Historically, revenues and earnings are lowest in the second fiscal quarter ending on March 31 and highest in the fourth fiscal quarter endingSeptember 30. The quarterly operating results fluctuation is mainly due to the seasonality in the garage door and installation businesses. The primary revenues of the garage door andinstallation businesses are driven by residential renovation and construction. Cold weather in the winter months usually reduces the level of building and remodeling activity in both the homeimprovement and new construction markets and, accordingly, has an adverse effect on the demand for garage door products and installation services. Seasonal fluctuation in the demand for garage doorproducts and installation services could have a material adverse effect on results of operations. Because a high percentage of manufacturing overhead and operating expenses is relatively fixedthroughout the year, operating margins have historically been lower in quarters with lower sales. As a result, operating results and stock price could be volatile, particularly on a quarterly basis. The Company is exposed to a variety of risks relating to international sales and operations, including foreign economic and political conditions and fluctuations in exchangerates.          The Company owns properties and conduct operations in Europe and South America through foreign subsidiaries. Sales of products through foreign subsidiariesaccounted for approximately 17% of net sales for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2007. These foreign sales could be adversely affected by changes in various foreign countries' political andeconomic conditions, trade protection measures, differing intellectual property rights and changes in regulatory requirements that restrict the sales of products or increase costs. Currencyfluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the currencies in the foreign countries or regions in which the Company does business may also have an impact on future operating results. 14 The Company may not be able to protect its proprietary rights.          The Company relies on a combination of patent, copyright and trademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements and othercontractual provisions to protect proprietary rights. Such measures provide only limited protection. The Company cannot assure that its means of protecting its proprietary rights will be adequate orthat competitors will not independently develop similar technologies. The Company is exposed to product liability claims.          The Company may be the subject of product liability claims in the future relating to the performance of its products or the performance of a product in which anyof its products was a component part. There can be no assurance that product liability claims will not be brought against the Company in the future, either by an injured customer of an end productmanufacturer who used one of the products as a component or by a direct purchaser from the Company. In addition, no assurance can be given that indemnification from customers or coverage underinsurance policies will be adequate to cover future product liability claims against the Company. Moreover, liability insurance is expensive, difficult to maintain and may be unobtainable in thefuture on acceptable terms. The amount and scope of any insurance coverage may be inadequate if a product liability claim is successfully asserted against the Company. Furthermore, if any significantclaims are made, the business may be adversely affected by any resulting negative publicity. The Company has been, and may in the future be, subject to claims and liabilities under environmental laws and regulations.          The Company's operations and assets are subject to federal, state, local and foreign environmental laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materialsinto the environment, the handling and disposal of wastes, including solid and hazardous wastes, or otherwise relating to health, safety and protection of the environment. The Company does not expectto make any expenditures with respect to ongoing compliance with or remediation under these environmental laws and regulations that would have a material adverse effect on its business, operatingresults or financial condition. However, the applicable requirements under the law may change at any time.         TheCompany can also incur environmental liabilities in respect of sites that it no longer owns or operates, as well as third party sites to which it has sent hazardous materials in thepast. The Company cannot assure that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in connection with such claims. A site in Peekskill in the town of Cortlandt, New York was previously owned andused by two of its subsidiaries. The Peekskill site was sold in December 1982. In 1984, the Company was advised by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation that randomsampling of the Peekskill site indicated concentrations of solvents and other chemicals common to the operations of its subsidiary that used the site. In May 1996, the subsidiary that formerlyowned the site entered into a consent order with the DEC to investigate and remediate environmental conditions at this site, including the performance of a remedial investigation and feasibilitystudy. After completing the initial remedial investigation, the subsidiary has now performed a supplemental remedial investigation under the consent order. Subsequently, an addendum to thesupplemental remediation investigation was negotiated and conducted and a further report submitted to the DEC. The Company believes, based on facts presently known, that the outcome of this matterwill not have a material adverse effect on its results of operations and financial condition. The Company cannot assure, however, that the discovery of presently unknown environmental conditions,changes in environmental laws and regulations or other unanticipated events will not give rise to claims that may involve material expenditures or liabilities. 15 Changes in income tax laws and regulations or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could adversely affect profitability.          The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions. Domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to theallocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. The Company's effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates,changes in any valuation allowance for deferred tax assets or the amendment or enactment of tax laws. The amount of income taxes paid is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. Federal, state and local taxauthorities and also by foreign authorities. If these audits result in assessments different from recorded income tax liabilities, future financial results may include unfavorable adjustments toincome tax expense. The Company's compliance with restrictions and covenants in its debt agreements may limit its ability to take corporate actions and harm the business.          The debt agreements contain a number of covenants that restrict the Company's ability to incur additional debt and to pay dividends. Under revolving creditagreement the Company is also required to comply with specific financial ratios and tests. The Company may not be able to comply in the future with these covenants or restrictions as a result ofevents beyond its control, such as prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If the Company defaults in maintaining compliance with the covenants and restrictions in its debt agreements,its lenders could declare all of the principal and interest amounts outstanding due and payable and terminate their commitments to extend credit to theCompany in the future. If the Company is unable to secure credit in the future, the business could be harmed. The Company's inability to repurchase outstanding convertible notes as required under the indenture may cause an event of default under other agreements.          On July 18, 2010, 2013, 2018 and upon a change in control, as defined in the indenture, noteholders will have the right to require repurchase of theirnotes. If the Company did not have sufficient funds to pay the repurchase price for all of the notes tendered, an event of default under the indenture governing the notes would occur as a result ofsuch failure. In addition, a change in control might breach a covenant under the Company's revolving credit agreement, and may be prohibited or limited by, or create an event of default under, otheragreements relating to borrowings that the Company may enter into from time to time. The Company's reported earnings per share may be more volatile because of the conversion contingency provision of the notes.          The outstanding convertible notes are convertible when a ""market price"" condition is satisfied and also upon the occurrence of other circumstances as more fullydescribed in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Upon conversion, noteholders will receive at least $1,000 in cash for each $1,000 principal amount of notes presented forconversion. The excess of the value of the company's common stock that would have been issuable upon conversion over the cash delivered will be paid to noteholders in shares of the Company's commonstock. These shares are considered in the calculation of diluted earnings per share and volatility in the Company's stock price could cause these notes to be dilutive in one quarter and not in asubsequent quarter, increasing the volatility of fully diluted earnings per share. The Company may be unable to raise additional financing necessary to conduct its business, make payments when due or refinance its debt.          The Company may need to raise additional funds in the future in order to implement its business plan, to refinance its debt or to acquire complementary businessesor products. Any required additional financing may be unavailable on terms favorable to the Company, or at all. If the Company raises additional funds by issuing equity securities, holders of commonstock may experience significant dilution of their ownership interest and these securities may have rights senior to those of the holders of the common stock. 16   The Company's indebtedness and interest expense will limit its cash flow and could adversely affect its operations and its ability to make full payment on its outstandingnotes.          The Company's indebtedness poses risks to its business, including the risks that: theCompany could use a substantial portion of its consolidated cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on its debt, thereby reducing the funds available forworking capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, product development and other general corporate purposes;insufficientcash flow from operations may force the Company to sell assets, or seek additional capital, which the Company may be unable to do at all or on terms favorableto the Company; andtheCompany's level of indebtedness may make it more vulnerable to economic or industry downturns. The Company has the ability to issue additional equity securities, which would lead to dilution of its issued and outstanding common stock.          The issuance of additional equity securities or securities convertible into equity securities would result in dilution of existing stockholders' equity interestsin the Company. The Company is authorized to issue, without stockholder approval, 3,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series, which may give other stockholders dividend, conversion,voting, and liquidation rights, among other rights, which may be superior to the rights of holders of our common stock. The board of directors has the authority to issue, without vote or action ofstockholders, shares of preferred stock in one or more series, and has the ability to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions of any such series. Any such series of preferred stockcould contain dividend rights, conversion rights, voting rights, terms of redemption, redemption prices, liquidation preferences or other rights superior to the rights ofholders of the common stock. The board of directors has no present intention of issuing any such preferred stock, but reserves the right to do so in the future. In addition, the Company is authorizedto issue, without stockholder approval, up to 85,000,000 shares of common stock, of which approximately 29,930,000 shares were outstanding as of September 30, 2007. The Company is alsoauthorized to issue, without stockholder approval, securities convertible into either shares of common stock or preferred stock"
